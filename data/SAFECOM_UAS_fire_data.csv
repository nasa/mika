Dispatch immediately dispatched a BLM law enforcement Ranger, who was already in the area to investigate. The BLM law enforcement ranger quickly located the drone operator and performed a traffic stop. After speaking with the drone operator the ranger determined that the drone operator, a foreign national, was attempting to film a documentary and was unaware of the tfr/fire operations. The ranger got the subjects contact info for follow up if needed. Drone operator was counseled by law enforcement on the dangers of drone use near fire operations. The operator acknowledged the dangers and was cooperative."

We transitioned with the relief ATGS at the same time that the all clear was given from safety, so we notified the relief that it was safe to resume all rotor operations.

Each Fire Boss had made two drops with 56BH continuing to do bucket work. The Pilot of AA1 noticed what he thought was a bird fly underneath the Air Attack platform and above the helicopter that was doing bucket work as AA1 observed from a higher altitude. As the pilot continued to watch the object’s flight he observed that its flight pattern was not consistent with a bird, but that it was instead an UAS quadcopter. AA1 informed 56BH that a UAS had been seen over the fire and 56BH discontinued bucket work and landed at an LZ south of the fire. AA1 repositioned east of the fire and contacted the IC and informed him of the UAS protocol and asked the IC’s assistance in locating the UAS’ operator. The IC made contact with law enforcement and had members of the local fire department that was already on scene to disperse and try to locate the operator. The earlier tanker drops and helicopter bucket work had taken care of most of the running fire. Air Attack 1 contacted HMGB Westerman for an assessment of the fire and his opinion if the ground resources could handle the remaining suppression work. Westerman informed AA1 that in his opinion it could be held with the resources on scene. AA1 contacted IC Butler and relayed the assessment and the IC released AA1. 56BH remained on the ground for approximately 25 minutes after AA1 departed the fire to return to Brainerd TB. The HMGB contacted Brainerd TB and asked that they call the Air Desk to determine the next steps as attempts to locate the drone operator were unsuccessful, and the UAS had not been seen since the initial sighting.

The UASM checked the TFR information and found that there was no TFR in effect when the observed aircraft entered the airspace where Unmanned FXXX was operating.
The original TFR boundary was extended by the airspace coordinator earlier in the day on June 11, 2020 to accommodate large air tanker operations.   Later during the operational shift on June 11, 2020, Air Traffic Control (ATC) contacted the airspace coordinator to establish a new TFR in order to better accommodate airport traffic operations.
The Fire’s Air Operations Branch Director contacted the airspace coordinator directly to discuss the TFR creation process and establish why TFR coverage was not in effect for the planned 24-hour period.  The 24-hour TFR coverage was established to provide safe airspace for the planned nighttime UAS operations on the Fire.
The airspace coordinator investigated the issue and discovered that both TFRs were, in fact, noted to provide 24-hour coverage over the Fire.  The gap in 24-hour coverage resulted after the first TFR  was effectively canceled at 2100 hours on June 11, 2020.  The new TFR  was created and was noted to provide 24-hour coverage.  However, the new TFR would not take effect until 0600 hours on June 12, 2020.  This process created a 9-hour time gap (2100 hours on June 11, 2020 through 0600 hours on June 12, 2020) during which there was no TFR coverage over the Fire.
Aircrew narrative:
At the beginning of shift on June, 11 (20:00) the flight crew verified airspace and found the TFR to be active. During the incursion, the manager attempted to contact the aircraft on the AM frequency assigned to the TFR with no avail. Then switched to the airport Unicom and attempted contact. During this time the TFR was reviewed and found to be invalid. At this point, the UAS held elevation at 5000 msl while the other aircraft flew over the top at 6500 msl. The decision was made to cancel the mission and land the UAS as soon as possible and wait for the TFR to be reviewed and active for the next shift.  No other UAS flights were conducted during this operational period

Helibase personnel quickly located the UAS operator in the ICP parking lot and the UAV returned to the ground.  Corrective actions taken were to communicate the unauthorized UAS to aircraft. Have aircraft depart the area until it could be confirmed the area was safe and to have the UAS operator land the UAV.
Helibase personnel took a photo of the UAS operators' license plate and incident personnel contacted local law enforcement. State Aviation Officer note: Citation was issued to the UAS pilot"

The mission objectives for the flight had been completed and the crew as preparing to bring the aircraft to landing, monitoring the aircraft visually as well as through the GCS.  The crash was located within the hour and the lithium batteries were secured for safety.  The remainder of the wreckage was recovered by 1pm on 8/9/20, with full pictures and deliberative mishap investigation process per AgTS and DOI mishap guidance. 

FireEye UAV Unit 2C (FAA #: N8887S) was destroyed while working on the DOI On-Call contract near Globe, AZ on the Cassadore Springs fire, August 8, 2020.  The aircraft was circling normally at 1000’ AGL in Guided mode, when the Cobra A33n engine failed.

The event occurred while pilot (UASP Aerial Ignition Trainee) and Visual Observer (Qualified UASP Aerial Igniton) were conducting UAS aerial firing operations on the night shift of the Pine Gulch Fire. The UASP flew to the area of the burnout and successfully completed the first leg of the burn pattern dropping  30 balls. The UASP was repositioning to initiate another leg of  firing when the aircraft gave a hatch motion error and puncture motion error. The VO assisted the pilot in resetting the Ignis per protocol. After reset the error became a red error signifying that it was unrecoverable in flight. The visual observer/qualified operator noticed that there appeared to be some form of heat signature visible through the camera that was not expected. He stated he believed there was hang fire in the dropper and took control of the aircraft controller. He then turned the camera to look directly at the Ignis 2 machine and visually confirmed fire in the dropper. He successfully initiated emergency procedure using the radio controller to detach the dropper from the hopper. The IGNIS 2 functioned as designed and the hang fire was separated from the hopper. The UASP remained over the ignition area swinging the jettisoned dropper to visually ensure that fire was extinguished in the dropper for approximately 2 minutes before flying back to landing area. Upon inspection of the aircraft and PSD machine, the melted sphere was still in the dropper. Minimal heat damage was noticed on one of the hopper hatches. No other damage was noticed. The machine was cleaned and bench tested, then flight tested before further use.

An AAR was conducted discussing what happened and how it was mitigated with the entire module. A good discussion was had regarding the procedures to follow when a unrecoverable error occurs in flight. Including immediately using the camera to identify any situations that would require the jettisoning of the slipper block and the need to ensure that you do not leave the fire area when there is potential to spread fire beyond the planned ignition area.

The next night another UASP had a hang fire, but the ball was witnessed to fall from the released dropper.  Pilot returned to the LZ without incident and the aircraft/IGNIS was inspected and returned to service.

To my knowledge these are the first hang fires to happen in over 100,000 balls dropped.","An AAR was conducted discussing what happened and how it was mitigated with the entire module.

The Unmanned Romeo XXX (URXXX, a Matrice 600), was engaged in aerial ignition near DP 10, and  the helicopter was working in a daisy chain of 3 helicopters supporting firefighters on the ground with bucket drops. Both aircraft were operating in Division T on the Woodward Fire near the Bear Valley Visitor’s Center (refer to map below).  Aerial supervision was in place and both aircraft were made aware of the presence of the other.   Helicopters were given a specific route to/from the dip and the sUAS was also provided a specific area to operate in.  

At approximately 1815 the pilot of the incident helicopter approached the vicinity of DP10, on his way to drop water on the fire.  The aircraft was on the designated route and was climbing from the dip to 1500 ft. MSL over the marine layer to the clear air, when he encountered visual contact with URXXX approximately 100 feet below.  URXXX was in a stationary hover over the marine layer at the time of the encounter. 

The 1000 ft AGL clearance over the highest terrain feature had positioned URXXX at approximately 1400 MSL, near the altitude where helicopters were operating.  The pilot of the helicopter altered course slightly to the right and passed by the UAV.  The helicopter pilot estimated the UAV to be at about the same altitude as the bucket, and about 100 ft horizontally to the left.  The helicopter continued on the designated route and descended to complete the drop.  Both the sUAS pilot and the helicopter pilot notified Air Attack, who halted the sUAS operation. 
Connection to the URXXX was momentarily lost during aerial ignition operations.  The sUAV was at 38% battery life, and reconnection to the aircraft was unsuccessful after several attempts by the operator. The sUAV pilot selected the “Go Home” button to initiate the lost link procedure. The aircraft was observed, by the helicopter pilot, hovering (stationary) at around 1400 ft. during the time of the signal interruption.   URXXX’s visual observer and pilot continued to look for the sUAV with no immediate success. URXXX was finally heard overhead of the original takeoff and landing area at DP10.  The pilot then depressed the “Go Home” button again regain control. The sUAV pilot then maneuvered URXXX to the south of DP10 to clear the smoke and marine layer and to regain a visual of the aircraft. URXXX was located to the south of DP10 and the pilot began descending the aircraft by pitching forward to the landing area south of DP10.  The aircraft was landed without further incident.","The sUAS pilot, the incident aviation managers, the helicopter pilot and the air attack all reviewed and discussed this situation to determine what could be done to prevent a similar event.  The following are the contributing factors and on-site recommendations: 
Factors contributing to this incident:
1.	Unmanned Romeo operating at altitudes assigned in AGL; other incident Aircraft operating with altitudes assigned at MSL
2.	Poor visibility due to smoke and persistent marine layer
3.	Close operating proximity
What went well:
1.	sUAS pilot immediately notified Air Attack, and shut down operation once the aircraft was back at the LZ
2.	sUAS Pilot followed all emergency procedures for loss of contact with UAV, IAW the manual
3.	sUAS Pilot notified Incident Aviation Managers (AOBD) in a timely manner 
4.	Helicopter Pilot practiced see and avoid
5.	All parties discussed this occurrence and provided input for this report
Recommendations:
1.	All incident aircraft should operate at MSL, rather than AGL.  This will ensure all incident aircraft are operating at the same altitude clearances. (Terrain changes when using AGL can cause conflict by overlapping altitudes with other aircraft operating at MSL, see fig 3). 
2.	Ensure safe operating space (horizontal and vertical) is provided between manned and unmanned aircraft.
3.	UAS pilots should notify Air Attack immediately of lost communications with the UAV to expedite awareness to other aircraft over incident.  A blind call on the appropriate A/G frequency is recommended.

2.	sUAS Pilot followed all emergency procedures for loss of contact with UAV, IAW the manual
3.	sUAS Pilot notified Incident Aviation Managers (AOBD) in a timely manner 
4.	Helicopter Pilot practiced see and avoid
5.	All parties discussed this occurrence and provided input for this report
Recommendations:
1.	All incident aircraft should operate at MSL, rather than AGL.  This will ensure all incident aircraft are operating at the same altitude clearances. (Terrain changes when using AGL can cause conflict by overlapping altitudes with other aircraft operating at MSL, see fig 3). 
2.	Ensure safe operating space (horizontal and vertical) is provided between manned and unmanned aircraft.
3.	UAS pilots should notify Air Attack immediately of lost communications with the UAV to expedite awareness to other aircraft over incident.  A blind call on the appropriate A/G frequency is recommended.

During the breakdown we noticed at 1953 a low flying commercial aircraft fly what seemed to be within our 0/0961 TFR 1/4 mile to the North of us. I immediately took a screen shot of my already open flightradar24 app. It showed Delta flight 988 at 9,286 msl.  It was a non-event as we were on the ground.  I called the ASGS (t) and sent him a screenshot. He spoke with Spokane approach and let them know.  The following morning, I made a follow-up call to Spokane prior to launch at the same LRZ. The supervisor was unaware. I received a follow-up call a short time later and was told that our TFR indeed was breached by Delta 988 and exited our TFR at 8,600.  I was concerned that this may happen again tonight. This is most likely a daily flight and if it happened again, we may be in the same airspace at the same time, as we are planning a similar mission.  I also asked if I needed to have a daily call into them prior to launch and recovery.

Even though good communications took place and the root of this cause was Approach Control dropping the ball, we still must always stay vigilant.

The public launches them to gather footage, and the media routinely collects video for news coverage reporting current conditions.  There are many reasons to use drones.
The xxx Creek Fire, since the wind event, has been under very poor visibility which has grounded our manned aviation operation, however we have been collecting some intel from a fire controlled UAS.  A TFR has been over the fire steady with the exception of one afternoon where it was cancelled to facilitate an adjacent fire posting their new TFR.
Only one agency has asked permission to fly in our TFR on private lands to collect information to facilitate their mission.  Another similar agency has produced video footage and has expressed no interest in working with the fire aviation program to communicate or meet FAA rules.  I am finding many do not fully comprehend the complexity of a fire aviation program, airspace coordination and the communication with players such, as ATGS who direct operations and set priorities.  This lack of understanding can place our pilots, and manned and unmanned aircraft at risk.  Results could be catastrophic or shut our air operations down. 
","As the UAS program continues grows, sanctioned and unsanctioned, UAS coordinators need to be more available to advise, coach valid users through the FAA approvals, and recommend how best to coordinate UAS airspace.  
On a complex fire, traditional air operation managers still have the load of the traditional aviation program and now this additional burden.  A lack of experience and understanding of UAS authorizations and operations makes it easy to say “no” rather than allowing the system to work and helping the UAS users to understand priorities, and learning how we can work together under tightly regulated access.

Aircraft was 3/4 of the way through the first transect when the pilot noticed the GCS indicated that the aircraft had stopped taking photos momentarily, but then resumed taking photos at the end of the transect.  The aircraft completed the first transect (flying south), then turned to the west to move to the next transect, but continued moving to the west and missed the turn back to the north.  Upon seeing the aircraft go off course, the pilot cancelled autonomous flight mode and attempted to regain manual flight control.  GCS indicated that the aircraft was responsive to command inputs and did yaw, but did not respond to pitch commands and it continued to move to the west.  Pilot attempted to initiate ""return to home"" mode using GCS, but aircraft did not respond.  Pilot used remote controller to begin aircraft descent.  Aircraft descended from 400 ft. to 330 ft., before the signal was lost.  Pilot and crew went to the last known location of the aircraft but did not find it, nor could they re-establish signal link to attempt and track it using the GCS.  At the last known location, the aircraft reported 60% battery.  After the fly away and loss of link event, the GCS reported ""0"" GPS satellites.  It is unknown if GPS signal was lost during flight, or if the GPS signal went to zero after the loss of link, as the pilot did not look at the GPS signal indicator when attempting to recover aircraft while controller still had signal link with the aircraft.  Based on the above information, the pilot assumes that the aircraft did lose GPS signal while in autonomous flight.  It did respond to manual input, for a brief period, but did not respond to ""return to home"" mode, which requires GPS signal.  It also did not return to home after leaving the geofence-limited area.  Winds were moderate (gusting to 15mph at the surface), but within aircraft limitations.  However, the delay from the time the aircraft first went off course to the time the pilot attempted to recover the aircraft may have been sufficient to allow the wind to carry the aircraft out of signal range.   ","While a definitive cause of the “fly away” event is uncertain, several factors may have contributed to it.  First, the pilot had never experienced GPS signal loss with the Parrot Anafi, nor even heard any other instances, which created a sense of complacency that the GPS “always works” on the Anafi… until it doesn’t.  The chance of it happening should have been anticipated and pro-active steps should have been taken to prepare for it.   The GPS on the Anafi can’t be turned off to practice manual flight, but proficiency flights should simulate GPS failure situations, to keep up the awareness level of the situation with both the pilot and crew.  
Secondly, while there is a pre-flight and post-flight checklist to ensure important steps are not missed, there was not an in-flight emergency checklist to follow to help guide the actions of the crew.  An in-flight emergency checklist, specific for each model of aircraft and each GCS due to variations in operability, should be part of a pilot’s standard checklist.  Having written instructions, easily accessible by the crew, will allow crewmembers to cue the pilot about what sequence of steps should be initiated.  During a stressful incident, i.e. an aircraft fly-away, a procedure checklist to follow will serve a pilot better than their fallible memory, since each aircraft and each GCS perform differently.  
Finally, on-going training (practice flights) would improve muscle memory of what actions to initiate during emergency operations.  In addition to routine proficiency flight, emergency exercises and scenarios should be implemented regularly to maintain preparedness levels.

Pilot was operating on the XX National Forest on a prescribed burn unit conducting aerial ignition.  This m600 had maintenance performed by a 3rd party vendor which replaced the motor mounts bought directly from DJI prior to this flight.  This was the 11th flight since maintenance had been completed, however this flight was with a fully loaded Ignis machine to conduct aerial ignition.  On the first UAS PSD mission for this particular m600 since new motor mount replacement, approximately 1 minute into flight, aircraft went into uncontrolled yaw that resulted in loss of control and impacted terrain.  Remote pilot recognized issue from past UAS motor separation incidents as aircraft was still in view and lowered lander gear with full accent input to try to slow decent rate.  Aircraft impacted the ground damaging landing gear and motors but without significant damage to payloads.  Proper notifications were made.
The aircraft was located and the motor was dangling from the motor mount via wires. Evidence of motor mount separation was evident. This strongly suggests that the motor broke free of the motor housing during flight.
","Mitigations:
Reduce the payload weight by reduction of number of balls to 250 and amount of glycol to 3/4 full when able.
All PPE will be used by ground crews during PSD operations.
No flights over people.
Minimize aggressive throttle and/or pitch/roll maneuvers.
If uncontrolled descent is occurring, immediately lower landing gear and go to max climb rate to slow the descent rate.
Be overly vigilant with pre-flight inspections.
Investigate potential motor mount replacements from third party vendors.

RASM:  Completely concur with above corrective actions.  The pilot and rest of the team deserve acknowledgement for reacting quickly in the moment but also for developing strong field countermeasures in real time and for the impending future.  While reducing the payload (reducing the max gross weight) works in the field, it is a short term fixe because it would seem the aircraft does not actually perform as advertised / designed and to expectations.  But, all the people in the FS and DOI UAS community are very passionate and known for, but also credited with even now, working towards what is needed for the long term, but also for any success that the Interagency UAS Program might realize.  Work is being done between the agencies along with NASA AMES and the FS Technology Center.  A TBO (Time Before Overhaul) practice might be considered if not already.
Although a version is already being exercised, an explanatory example is still offered, for whatever that might be worth:  QDR (Quality Deficiency Report System).  Major initiative to identify and resolve deficiencies in fielded equipment. When a fielded item fails to perform as expected and the user suspects that the problem is quality-related, a report is submitted to the responsible commodity for investigation and resolution and possible redesign.

Pilot was operating on the XX National Forest on a prescribed burn unit conducting aerial ignition.  This m600 had maintenance performed by a 3rd party vendor which replaced the motor mounts bought directly from DJI prior to this flight.  This was the 11th flight since maintenance had been completed, however this flight was with a fully loaded Ignis machine to conduct aerial ignition.  On the first UAS PSD mission for this particular m600 since new motor mount replacement, approximately 1 minute into flight, aircraft went into uncontrolled yaw that resulted in loss of control and impacted terrain.  Remote pilot recognized issue from past UAS motor separation incidents as aircraft was still in view and lowered lander gear with full accent input to try to slow decent rate.  Aircraft impacted the ground damaging landing gear and motors but without significant damage to payloads.  Proper notifications were made.
The aircraft was located and the motor was dangling from the motor mount via wires. Evidence of motor mount separation was evident. This strongly suggests that the motor broke free of the motor housing during flight.
 Mitigations:
Reduce the payload weight by reduction of number of balls to 250 and amount of glycol to 3/4 full when able.
All PPE will be used by ground crews during PSD operations.
No flights over people.
Minimize aggressive throttle and/or pitch/roll maneuvers.
If uncontrolled descent is occurring, immediately lower landing gear and go to max climb rate to slow the descent rate.
Be overly vigilant with pre-flight inspections.
Investigate potential motor mount replacements from third party vendors.

RASM:  Completely concur with above corrective actions.  The pilot and rest of the team deserve acknowledgement for reacting quickly in the moment but also for developing strong field countermeasures in real time and for the impending future.  While reducing the payload (reducing the max gross weight) works in the field, it is a short term fixe because it would seem the aircraft does not actually perform as advertised / designed and to expectations.  But, all the people in the FS and DOI UAS community are very passionate and known for, but also credited with even now, working towards what is needed for the long term, but also for any success that the Interagency UAS Program might realize.  Work is being done between the agencies along with NASA AMES and the FS Technology Center.  A TBO (Time Before Overhaul) practice might be considered if not already.
Although a version is already being exercised, an explanatory example is still offered, for whatever that might be worth:  QDR (Quality Deficiency Report System).  Major initiative to identify and resolve deficiencies in fielded equipment. When a fielded item fails to perform as expected and the user suspects that the problem is quality-related, a report is submitted to the responsible commodity for investigation and resolution and possible redesign.
In the ongoing effort to reduce the risk to personnel inherent with Ariel ignition, the agencies at the highest-level ought to own an obligation to resource and provide themselves with the most favorable and safest tools possible.

The pilot had already completed three flights that day, with minimal issues.  During the second flight, the GCS indicated that the signal between controller and aircraft was weak, and “Return to Home” would be initiated soon, but pilot increased altitude and the signal improved, and RTH was not initiated.  Prior to take off for the third flight, both the controller and aircraft GPS signal did not lock (did not turn green).  After waiting 1-2 minutes, and repositioning the aircraft, both GPS remained red.  The aircraft was rebooted, and shortly after that, both GPS turned green.  There were no anomalies during the third flight.  During the fourth flight, no issues were noted prior to take-off or during the first 15 minutes of flight, but at about 15 minutes the controller provided haptic feedback and indicated that the aircraft GPS signal was lost, and the aircraft was auto-landing in place.  The GCS did not provide an option to cancel the auto-landing.  The pilot attempted to break out of the auto-landing by providing various control inputs (climb, pitch forward, yaw, return to home), but the aircraft did not respond and the video feed was lost as it descended below the tree line and out of sight.   The pilot was driven to within 500 feet of the last known location of the aircraft, as noted by the GCS, but the aircraft did not reconnect with the GCS.  The pilot and members of the fire crew performed a search of the area, but the suspected landing area was a pine forest with a thick under story of saw palmetto, and the aircraft was not recovered.  At the time the aircraft descended, the area beneath it was green, but within an hour, the advancing fire burned over much of the area.  
The GCS app in use for all flights was the Parrot FreeFlight 6 app.  All flights conducted in manual flight mode.  Prior to all flights, the safety settings on the GCS were verified that the aircraft would Return to Home and land In case of signal loss (and not land in place or hover in place).  A geofence of .7 miles was set to keep the aircraft within its specified flight range.  The aircraft was within line of sight of the pilot at all times, maintaining a position above the tree line, and the pilot had eyes on aircraft at the time the GCS indicated the GPS signal loss.  The last known location of the aircraft was approximately 2400 feet from the pilot, and there was no indication that the radio signal was weak (no on-screen warning) prior to the auto-land activating, nor during any telemetry checks during the flight.  The issue during the second flight with a weak signal seems to confirm that the aircraft would return to home if it lost signal, but evidence suggests the aircraft lost both GPS signal and the radio signal to the GCS at the same time.

(p. 4) Further consultation with the Forest FAO led to a discussion about the role of Dispatch during an operational flight on an extended attack fire. It was decided that Dispatch should call all the aircraft and confirm that they are aware of UAS operations in the area or call to confirm that the UAS is on the ground. In the end, this was a learning experience about UAS protocols. We (dispatch) familiarized ourselves with PMS 515 and had some good discussions about potential scenarios.  Ultimately, clear communication was identified as the key to successful operations. Arrival of a UAS on a fire is a trigger point that protocols for airspace coordination will need to be established. It is still not completely clear if there is a standard is for this situation or if protocols will be developed on a case-by-case basis. Another miscommunication: the logs for 6/11 indicated that the UAS and Helicopter would NOT be in the air at the same time. (It's not believed that they were ever in the air together) It was also realized that we didn't really have a clear plan for monitoring the UAS flight (no AFF or timers). Another discussion that arose is whether a qualified aircraft dispatcher is required to track UAS activity, especially during night operations, when staff may be limited. In sum, this was a valuable learning experience that brought up many new questions related to UAS operations and opened our eyes to potential issues.

Approximately 3.5 hours later, at 15:38, Helicopter XXX called Dispatch to announce that they would be flying a reconnaissance mission over the fire. At 15:49, the UAS operator called in to let us know that Unmanned Romeo was on the ground and they would let us know when they lifted again. When Helicopter XXX landed, shortly after 16:00, Dispatch received a call from the IC that the UAS crew had some concerns that Dispatch did not alert them that the Helicopter was about to fly over the Fire. After consulting NWCG document PMS 515 (NWCG Standards for Fire Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations), it appeared that mission flights should be coordinated ""with participating aircraft when aerial supervision is not on scene."" (p. 4) Further consultation with the Forest FAO led to a discussion about the role of Dispatch during an operational flight on an extended attack fire. It was decided that Dispatch should call all the aircraft and confirm that they are aware of UAS operations in the area or call to confirm that the UAS is on the ground. In the end, this was a learning experience about UAS protocols. We (dispatch) familiarized ourselves with PMS 515 and had some good discussions about potential scenarios.  Ultimately, clear communication was identified as the key to successful operations. Arrival of a UAS on a fire is a trigger point that protocols for airspace coordination will need to be established. It is still not completely clear if there is a standard is for this situation or if protocols will be developed on a case-by-case basis. Another miscommunication: the logs for 6/11 indicated that the UAS and Helicopter would NOT be in the air at the same time. (It's not believed that they were ever in the air together) It was also realized that we didn't really have a clear plan for monitoring the UAS flight (no AFF or timers). Another discussion that arose is whether a qualified aircraft dispatcher is required to track UAS activity, especially during night operations, when staff may be limited. In sum, this was a valuable learning experience that brought up many new questions related to UAS operations and opened our eyes to potential issues. Going forward, we recommend wider distribution of PMS 515 and other UAS operational documents as well as more training and discussion about standard operating procedures."

I had taken off and landed two times previously while completing the requested IR missions for the fire we were on.

We did that, and went through the start up sequence to the point of arming the motors.  Everything appeared to functioning normally.  We disarmed the motors and shut the UAS down.  ","There are two parts to this Safecom.  The first is the actual event where the UAS tipped over, and the second is a discussion on the BLM guidance for UAS training on new platforms.  My intent with submitting this Safecom is that we may learn from both parts.

The tip over:

When I got back to my computer the following day, I reviewed the M600 manual to see what I had done wrong, since I didn’t feel like I had changed anything in my landing and disarming procedure from the first two flights, to the third, where the tip over occurred.  
While pulling both controller sticks down and in is an approved method for disarming the M600 as stated in the M600 manual, it is a much riskier procedure, as was evidenced by the tip over.  If the motors are not at full idle prior to bring the right stick down and in, there is still enough power in the propellers to provide pitch and roll to the aircraft.  So while I felt like I did the same maneuver for disarming each time, I must have been a little quicker with the right controller stick input on the third landing, than on the first two landings.  This has a very simple remedy.
The M600 manual also recommends that the UAS be disarmed by using the left control stick only in the down position.  The motors take 3 seconds to power down using this method, but there is no chance for any additional pitch or roll inputs when using the left stick down method.  So, this was a good learning moment for me, and hopefully, others can learn from it as well without having to an M600 over.  

Add-on training guidance:

After the events of the day, and after numerous phone calls were made to discuss what had happened, it became clear to me that there was a lack of clarity regarding the UAS guidance for this particular situation that we were in.  One of the questions that came up was whether or not the fully qualified UAS pilot I was flying with on the fire was able to train me on the M600 platform.  Below is an excerpt from the OAS Sharepoint site that provides guidance for training UAS pilots on new platforms. (Since OPM-11 doesn’t directly address Add-on training, and I don’t think there is any specific BLM guidance, I believe the OAS Sharepoint site is the most current language for how the Bureaus intend to operate).
“Bureau Instructors will be able to provide A-454 Aircraft Add-on training to carded DOI remote pilots that need a specific “make and model” added to their OAS-30U card. Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List with an endorsement for A-454 Add-On Training and for the aircraft being evaluated may train and recommend additional aircraft qualifications.”
After reading the above statement, I believed that Bureau Instructors were one group of people, and that Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List were another group of people, and it made sense to me.  It seemed very analogous to the manned aviation process for add-on training.  Last summer I did some add-on training for my private pilot’s license when I took a 3 day course to get my float rating.  I was trained each day by a CFI (certified flight instructor), and she taught me how to fly on floats.  She could not however, sign me off as being certified for my float rating.  The DPE (designated pilot examiner) had to do that.  So, when I read the above referenced OAS language, I saw the parallel within that language to how manned aviation worked.  Bureau instructors (CFI’s on the manned aviation side) could train pilots how to fly a new aircraft, and Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List were the ones who could certify that those pilots learning to fly a new aircraft were indeed good to go (the role of the DPE on the manned aviation side).  This also fit nicely with how the Position Task Book system is set up.  Individuals who are Qualified in a position are the ones who train trainees for that position.  
After many conversations with a number of folks, I came to understand that this wasn’t the interpretation of the guidance that the Bureau was operating under.  Some folks at the national program level were unclear about how the guidance should be interpreted, but it seemed the majority believed that “Bureau instructors” and “Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List” were the same group of people, not two separate groups.
What this shows me is that we have an opportunity to clarify the guidance.  Anytime there is enough uncertainty in policy language or bureau guidance, there lies an opportunity to help fix it for everyone in the future.  The intent may be clear to those who are immersed in the program, but if I was able to misinterpret it, others will likely do so as well.

UAS was on Div U to assist with aerial ignitions and gridding/patrolling for spot fires during a burnout operation.  Prior to this incident, UAS had conducted 22 flights from this location.  
The crews started burning at approximately 10:30. The burnout was progressing from the DP132 area to the Div U/T break.  Div U had requested UAS to provide IR flights to assist the holding resources with identifying spot fires.  The UAS was being flown from a large meadow approximately 2000ft from the fire line. UAS was given clearance to operate 5,500ft and below on altimeter 30.12 from DP 132 to the Div U/T break.  AA also informed UAS that there was a Type 2 helicopter working to the south in Div T and a Type 1 working in Div W.  UAS was requesting clearance before each flight.  This flight occurred at 16:27.   
Approximately 12 minutes into the flight I heard a helicopter coming in from the north.  I told the UASP(t) to descend to the treetops and return to the launch area.  From my location the helicopter seemed to be moving along the fire edge to the east of DP-162 and not in the direction of the UAS.  Once the UAS was over the meadow and below the treetops (approximately 2 min), I contacted AA on air to ground primary.  I let AA know that we are still conducting UAS operations and the helicopter seemed close to our area of operations and asked if we needed to set down to allow the helicopter to work.   AA reply was that the helicopter “wandered a bit too far” and to standby.  The UASP(t) landed the UAS (approximately another 2 min), I then let AA know we were on the ground and we were told to stay on the ground.   The UAS remained on the ground the remainder of the shift.  
The image below is of the track log of the UAS during the flight overlaid on the ops map of the fire.  The green icon is where the UAS was launched from.

1. The UASL attended a meeting at the helibase the following day.  Although at the conclusion of the meeting everyone was able to say what they needed and end on a positive note, there were some comments that may need to be discussed further.  
2. Both helicopters were unaware that a UAS was in the air during their missions.  
3.  The UAS was repeatedly called a toy and it was stated that the UAS pilots “don’t have any skin in the game” and that if we crash a drone we just get another one where as if we crash into a helicopter they would be taking a “dirt nap”.   Although I completely agree with the pilots frustrations and concerns with UAS better communication preseason with the helicopter community as a whole might help with integration.  Use cases and examples of how UAS is utilized usually helps to understand why the demand for UAS is growing so rapidly.  
4. The UASL was asked why we didn't call the helicopter on the victor freq.  The use of hand held VHF radios from the ground has proven to be unreliable for communication.  
5. PMS-515 states For Type 3 and Type 4 UAS Communications are maintained with the UAS crew only on assigned FM frequencies.                           Region 1 UAS Aviation Specialist: 
1.	The UAS crew followed all their and the Aerial Supervision procedures. But as is not uncommon, things slip through the cracks. When the UAS crew had concerns about the proximity of the helicopter they made a smart and safe decision to descend out of the way and establish communication to check everyone’s situational awareness. This is good decision making on their part. 
2.	Communication on the air-to-air frequencies is a problem that needs to be solved. A UAS is an aircraft and therefore should have reliable communication on those frequencies. I don’t know how to solve it except to go to radio experts with our issues. A vehicle radio seems impractical, so the solution seems to lie in some sort of booster or antenna. 
3.	Situational awareness enhancement could also be achieved by petitioning the FAA to allow ADS-B output on our UAS. This is again an issue that is probably not easy to accomplish, but worth pursuing. 
4.	Manned aircraft pilots having the opinion that UAS has no “skin in the game” in regards to a collision is not unreasonable. To alleviate this, I think the suggestions already discussed would help. To reiterate: More reliable communication and situational awareness may make the manned aircraft pilots and crews feel better about sharing the airspace with UAS. If the manned aircraft pilots believe that they will be able to talk to and see where the UAS is when they need to, their concerns should be diminished. Also, continuing the communication procedures by the UAS pilots as was done in this instance should also be a mitigation for a mishap.

After the aircraft overshot the Launch and Recovery Zone (LRZ), it transitioned from forward flight to hover at 200 ft. AGL, 70 ft. above the planned 130 ft. AGL.

The transition process, as expected, flared the aircraft upward by an additional 50 ft. With the aircraft in AUTO mode, the autopilot moved the aircraft in reverse to position over the LRZ. As the aircraft did this, the telemetry logs (tlogs) show that the aircraft autopilot sought to maintain attitude before rapidly descending to land.

URXX was located in Division Uniform, 1.33 miles to the south, southwest of the K/U break. Take off and landing location for URXX was in Division Uniform,  on the south side shoulder of Cecilville road.
Prior to URXX launch, the visual observer (V.O.) contacted HLCO, and received permission for URXX to fly in Division Uniform, with altimeter and altitude established. HLCO added, that they would be far  past the area where URXX was operating. Approximately 8-9 minutes into the flight, HLCO contacted URXX and stated they would be flying near DIV U, but would stay out of Div U. HLCO called again, and said they would stay to the north of Cecilville road, UXX acknowledged and advised they would be landing in 5 minutes. Roughly 1-2 minutes later, the pilot for URXX heard a helicopter approaching URXX’s location. Five seconds later, the URXX pilot had a visual on the helicopter. From the URXX pilot perspective, both aircraft were heading directly at each other at indistinguishable altitudes. URXX made a 90 degree turn south to avoid the approaching path of the helicopter. The helicopter flew directly over the landing pad for URXX(located on the south shoulder of Cecilville road). VO contacted HLCO and advised that they just flew over URXX landing location and stated that they were not North of Cecilville road as previously stated. HLCO acknowledged he was close but thought he would be clear of the airspace. VO called HLCO again to let them know how close they actually were. HCLO acknowledged again and stated they would do better next time. URXX pilot landed UAS with no further incident.
URXX pilot pulled the flight log from URXX to get an accurate measurement of distance between the 2 aircraft (300-350 ft).
URXX pilot and VO immediately drove to a cell phone location to inform AOBD and ASGS and discuss further with HLCO of the event.

Preflight checklist was routine and unremarkable. Mission plan on launch was to monitor UAS aerial ignition groundwork directly adjacent to LZ. This mission objective was met quickly and unremarkably. On scene incident personnel then requested IR recon approx. one mile east (Carter Meadows Summit aka H1, see figure). Slopes around H1 had been experiencing rapid fire growth, and several recon missions had been successfully completed prior to this request. As such, this repeat request was heeded given the proximity of H1, known hazards, and remaining battery reserves.

This recon around H1 revealed substantial new growth below and on ridges further east, and an add’l direction was given to scout further eastward to gauge fire extent and holding lines. Pilot in command noted remaining battery life (65.5% average across six) and proceed NE then E, gaining ground rapidly due to strong tailwind. This tailwind was not present in recent prior recon flights around H1.

Approx 1.5mi east of LZ the video feed became unstable. Pilot briefly halted for recon then began navigating home to the west. Notably, video feed did not stabilize despite closing the distance to the LZ – intermittent/broken feed, and frozen screen required VO to disconnect and reconnect tablet cable to GCS. At this point VO noted speed of ~16mph despite full deflection pitch forward. This is a known indicator of severe headwind. GCS remained connected (“green”) throughout with PIC in control.

At approx. 1mi east of LZ the craft crossed a large valley that rises steeply up to H1. This was very near the location of a known spot from earlier in the day. As the aircraft approached the westward valley slopes rising up to H1, feed was lost followed by loss of link to GCS. Remaining battery was 24% (average across six), distance to LZ was ~4900ft. Connection was not reestablished. After 10 minutes monitoring airspace for autonomous return to home, the aircraft was presumed lost and airspace authority notifications were made. Due to loss of link and remaining battery life, the incident was reported as a UAS flyaway.

Following notifications and airspace re-clearance, the UAS module regrouped and resumed filling incident recon requests using backup aircraft until end of shift.","*Be aware of mission creep* The mission plan on launch was expanded with two subsequent in-flight requests. Completing these requests brought UAS endurance factors into play that were potentially manageable, but not considered in advance to identify and mitigate risks before they arose. If multiple destinations had been considered before launch, range and battery management would have been scrutinized. Returning to LZ from this flight with standard 35% battery reserves would have been in question.

*Gauge winds throughout flight* Wind amplifies fire behavior and diminishes aircraft endurance. Winds at LZ were no factor, but were substantial in adjacent area where the majority of flight took place. Variable winds led to bad aircraft position, and drove convective fire behavior along the path home to LZ.

*Be aware of rapidly changing environmental factors when performing repeat flights with the same mission profile* Repeated flights of the same mission profiles can cause complacency.

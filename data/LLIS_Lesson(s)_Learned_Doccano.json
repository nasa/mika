{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The improvements in K2 operations and science data analysis resulting from 1.5 years of experience with this new mission concept, and quantified by the metrics in this paper, will support continuation of K2's already high level of scientific productivity in an extended K2 mission.","Lesson ID":28903}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Early in the design and development phase, a complete end-to-end analysis should be developed for signal paths to help identify potential failure scenarios that could eliminate end item redundancy. The analysis should include all relevant interfacing subsystems (i.e. Ground Special Power, facility power, KGCS\/comm, etc) and should not just be limited to the single subsystem and its associated signals under review.","Lesson ID":28101}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"In bi-propellant systems there is a risk that high oxidizer vapor content may create vapor FORP at the fuel check valve, resulting in a sticking propulsion check valve during an in-flight maneuver and anomalous engine operation, which could lead to loss of mission. The current method used by Juno and other spaceflight missions to limit propulsion system contact with propellant vapor to benign concentrations relies largely on quad-redundant check valves, and pyrolitic isolation valves in the oxidizer side. The Juno anomaly exemplifies the risk that high oxidizer vapor content may cause a sticking check valve during a maneuver that will result in the engine operating well outside of the qualified mixture ratio; this may lead to loss of the mission. However, the Juno mission is on track to achieve its mission objectives due largely to the availability of sufficient downlinked propulsion system health data to accurately characterize the system state.","Lesson ID":28105}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The use of preliminary drawings for analysis in flight components should be avoided. If a preliminary configuration is used, strong lines of communication must be maintained between designers and analysts to determine the effects of design changes to the fidelity of analysis results.","Lesson ID":28202}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When using only (IMU-based) inertial measurement during flight operations in close proximity to a planetary body, be aware that very small errors in the on-board model of local gravity (as well as attitude knowledge errors) can cause GN&C to induce unintended accelerations and produce large velocity errors. Such errors in vertical or horizontal velocity estimation related to gravitational variations (see Figure 2) can cause damage to a planetary lander during the terminal maneuver.","Lesson ID":27901}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Field effect transistors (FETs) may become vulnerable to radiation damage after being subjected to an over-voltage condition-- even where the drain-to-source (D-S) voltage exceeds the manufacturer\u2019s limits only briefly. When leakage inductance is present in a system, transient over-voltage conditions may result that could contribute to this susceptibility. Circuit design and analysis may not consider that the risk to radiation-hardened FETs from this overvoltage condition is due to SEE susceptibility (as opposed to voltage stress or other factors commonly included in circuit analysis.) This vulnerability as the proximate cause of the SMAP failure is supported by the tests described above, where 100 percent of the test article devices failed when the SMAP on-orbit conditions were reproduced.","Lesson ID":27701}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The circuit used to capture the state of fire control signals in Fig. 1 sets the F\/F on the positive edge of the clock line. Clock inputs on F\/Fs are edge-triggered and can respond to very fast pulses. The problem with this design approach is that noise on the clock line can set the F\/F. The design has three undesirable features (1) the D input is preloaded by connecting it directly to Vcc, (2) there is susceptibility to high frequency noise as the CP input can respond to nanosecond pulses, and (3) there is no mechanism to limit or qualify the clock input to reduce the window of when noise could affect the circuit. Alternate design approaches can reduce the sensitivity of this circuit.","Lesson ID":27003}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"1) More recent or current versions of books, including text books, may not have as much information and guidance as older versions of text books. The book is Centrifugal Pump Design and Performance by David Japikse, William Marscher and Raymond Furst. The only way to know if the edition of the referenced book is the correct one being purchased is to examine the book to ensure the needed content is there. The copyright reference in the beginning of the book should not include the 2006 copyright date. Technically, the 2006 edition should have a different ISBN number, but a new number was not issued for this book. 2) Ability to obtain help and guidance from other experienced engineers in highly technical fields within an installation is necessary to perform current and future work at the same level as in the past.","Lesson ID":25701}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"According to Reference (3): Significant preparation is required to develop a new test capability at a NASA center\u2014in this case PQ testing per Space Station Protocols. New engineering processes require extensive internal review by project and line management-- and in this case also by external partners (i.e., counterparts at other NASA centers).","Lesson ID":26303}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"LL1: Smoke and Fire Alarm System deactivated for construction: Although the alarm systems were deactivated for the construction activities in the third floor area, this is a normal approach to construction activities at SSC and did not have a major impact. LL2: SSC did not execute the established Incident Response Team (IRT) processes: The emergency response by the fire department was executed extremely well for this mishap, but the required IRT process was never implemented. Without the guidelines of the IRT process, the impounding and security of the mishap area was potentially jeopardized.","Lesson ID":5437}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Sine burst testing is inherently risky due to the short duration and high amplitude of the test. Performing sine burst testing of hardware with nonlinear dynamics adds an increased level of risk.","Lesson ID":25801}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Throughout the K2 mission, potential adverse spacecraft scenarios, which were not considered during the original mission development, were envisioned. These included safing due to fuel exhaustion, safing without reaction wheels, data rates below 100 bps, and no DSN contacts for weeks at a time. In each case the scenario was discovered and mitigated well before it was necessary, allowing plenty of time to test on the ground and, in some cases, in flight.","Lesson ID":25504}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"After the second reaction wheel failure, only two good reaction wheels remained and were insufficient to continue with the Kepler mission. In order to not abandon the spacecraft a new attitude control approach needed to be created, but it was only possible through the use of very low-level configuration table commands that were never intended to be used in flight. Their use enabled the K2 mission, and eventually doubled the useful life of the spacecraft.","Lesson ID":25503}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Early in the Kepler mission the operations team had little experience with both the spacecraft and the in-flight risks associated with the mission. As such, anomaly responses involved large teams of engineers and even larger committees that were required to approve any small step toward recovery. Later in the mission the spacecraft and relative risks were much better understood, and the oversight required to make effective decisions dropped dramatically. An example is the safing of the spacecraft due to a processor power-on reset. Once the underlying cause was established and the response was standardized, an Anomaly Resolution Board was no longer necessary to approve of recovery in subsequent events. This streamlined process significantly improved the efficiency of science data collection later in the mission.","Lesson ID":25505}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"NASA is better served by including certain baseline information, data, and (at least temporary) access to the model (or model-system) as required deliverables for analysis contracts. This additional information, data, or products can provide a more concrete basis for understanding the model, its development, and use. Note: It is understood that not all the requirements for a model or analysis may be known at the time of contract execution. This is similar to most development type contracts in NASA. It is, therefore, incumbent on the parties to such a contract to review and accept new or modified requirements when they become available.","Lesson ID":25509}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"While no personnel were injured in this event, the personnel in the area performing the work were in the immediate vicinity of the over pressurized actuator. If personnel had been standing closer to the actuator, or in a different location, the ejected components would have caused serious injury. Relative perceptions of low-pressure systems versus high-pressure systems, utilizing inert commodities, and complacency can lead to design errors, and operational mistakes. Temporary changes are inherent in operating complex systems, yet need to be clearly understood and documented. Frequently these changes may occur within exceptionally short periods, and are reconfigured back to original requirements by the same personnel. However, any number of factors may influence the timing and resources applied to these tasks, and there is an increased risk of error if those changes are not systematically controlled.","Lesson ID":24501}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The two designs described above were developed more than 50 years after the Guidelines were published in the open literature. The first lesson here is that physics doesn\u2019t change over time and the Guidelines should not be ignored. A second lesson is to avoid using codes which cannot check whether such behavior can occur. The second lesson follows from the current practice of using Reynolds-Averaged CFD codes to predict the vehicle flow behavior and acquire loads for the initial databases. Such codes are not capable of predicting the kinds of flow behavior that violating the NASA Guidelines can produce. Hence, a false sense of security can prevail unless the Guidelines are known and promulgated to the designers and analysts.","Lesson ID":25602}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Cryogenic bearings are a unique subset of bearings. They operate in an environment different from other bearings. Off-the-shelf bearings will not meet the safety and reliability requirements of high power turbopumps. Engineering design, computer modeling, testing, and validation are needed to ensure a quality product. Bearings made with a ceramic material proved very resilient to the operating conditions, but developed a surface condition not seen before. Testing and demonstration provided evidence that the bearings were robust. The Space Shuttle Program (SSP) adopted the use of the material, Cronidur 30, providing significantly longer life for Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) turbines.","Lesson ID":24006}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Lessons Learned from the Static Software Analysis of the NASA Autonomous Flight Termination Software (AFTS) were: The definition of the software coding standards was non-specific. A general statement of \u201cC++ is a suboptimal language for use in safety critical systems, deficiencies in the language are mitigated to an acceptable level by adherence to the MISRA C++ 2008 coding standard\u201d. The \u201cacceptable level\u201d was never defined.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"NASA policy (NPR 7120.5 and NPR 7123.1B) and guidance (NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (SP-2016-6105), Rev 2) are primarily based on the waterfall development model. Programs using the lifecycle models described in these references must be aware the providers using a different life cycle model will not conform to the NASA waterfall model. This can lead to a variety of unfulfilled expectations and design activities that happen in a different sequence and time phasing than expected by the NASA model.","Lesson ID":24502}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"While bird strikes are most typical during landing and takeoff, sustained flight at low altitudes during airborne missions raises the likelihood of bird strikes at times other than takeoff and landing.","Lesson ID":24403}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"In situations where complex testing must be completed quickly, V&V planning should include a method for rapidly identifying and dispositioning issues encountered during testing, modifying hardware, software and documentation and resuming testing. Testing processes need to support efficient Problem Report\/Nonconformance disposition process. The process needs to be supported by on-site capability for modifying hardware\/software and quickly updating the engineering documentation and testing procedures. Delays during V&V testing in facilities where unmodified heritage systems had a long period without maintenance resulted from uncertainty about the condition of unmaintained systems. Bringing the unmaintained systems back into a usable state was time-consuming. It is important to ensure that all equipment is ready for use before any testing involving that equipment. EGS Elements did not always purchase spares ahead of time to support V&V testing. Some of these spares were long lead items. Late procurement of long-lead spares resulted in testing delays. Spares were purchased in small groups rather than large orders and were more expensive. It is important to ensure spares are available to support V&V testing, especially long-lead items. When doing large-scale testing, it is important to identify the required services and commodities ahead of time so that institutional suppliers can provide them in a timely manner. KSC uses fixed-price contracting for institutional support providers and these commodities and services may become much more expensive if the quantity of the service or commodity are outside the baseline contract scope. An example of a support service we had issues with is calibration. Test scheduling did not account for delays caused by the large number of calibrations needed to support testing. Work being performed in KSC facilities is complex due to the responsibility for various systems being divided between a numbers of contracts. When projects modify systems in these facilities, there may be other organizations in these facilities doing work at the same time. Modifying one system may impact systems owned by different organizations. The IT contractor, the facility support contractor, various EGS projects and the installation contractors for hardware may all be trying to operate simultaneously in the facility. Coordinating activities within the facility across all the organizations and coordinating and communicating system outages with all stakeholders is vital to success. For example, an outage for modifications to Ground Special Power may affect maintenance or testing activities involving other systems.","Lesson ID":23901}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When there are requirements for different missions or the requirements are to be implemented at different times, the requirements should be separated and a mission effectivity used to designate the related mission. Requirements should be managed in a single tool rather than allowing projects to have a separate way of managing their requirements. Evidence of design compliance (requirements verification matrices) should also be integrated into the tool to ensure all requirements are in sync and closure evidence is available. An alternative solution is to allow the use of different tools but to ensure that these data sets remain in sync (interoperability). Requirements should be allocated through the system structure and reflect the actual architecture of the system rather than being allocated in a way that reflects the management structure. If requirements closure is needed to support a milestone, long test sequences should be split into separate tests. An efficient process should be created to ensure test completion evidence is quickly available in configuration-managed repositories and is linked to the requirements being closed by the test. Design specifications or standards should be decomposed into individual requirements at the project level, and only requirements relevant to the project should be retained.","Lesson ID":23801}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"1. Developing a spaceflight parts program with the use of automotive and non-automotive grade commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts, and basing it solely on the performance of a destructive physical analysis (DPA) and review of Production Part Approval Process (PPAP) documentation may not be sufficient to reduce risk to acceptable value. It carries the inherent implementation risk that the detailed PPAP documentation, required to verify device design and process reliability may not be available in a timely manner, if at all. 2. Automotive Executive Council (AEC) certified devices are vendor self-certified; there is no AEC governing body that verifies the certified device(s) has (have) met all of the AEC specification requirements. This is in contrast to military products, where Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Land and Maritime (LAM) provides an oversight function for all Qualified Manufacturer Listing\/Qualified Products List (QML\/QPL) device qualification data. Hence, the certificate of compliance that comes with either automotive COTS or nonautomotive parts does not clearly specify that the parts meet all data sheet parameters that designers use for their applications. 3. Use of an automotive grade device does not automatically guarantee higher quality or reliability than a commercial grade device. Therefore, use of an automotive grade device may not be sufficient to meet all space flight applications or requirements without additional analysis and\/or testing. 4. New technology implementations in packaging of EEE parts are more common in automotive and nonautomotive grade devices and require new and specialized techniques during de-processing for DPA or preparation for radiation testing. The standard de-processing techniques specified by the military standards (e.g. MIL-STD-1580) used in ceramic\/metallic hermetic space level packages are insufficient for properly evaluating the nuances in the more cutting-edge design\/construction parts.","Lesson ID":23502}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Li-ion batteries pose unique risks to safe storage, handling, and use; JPL had had a previous major Li-ion battery fire (Reference (2)), plus a JPL facility suffered a major lead-acid battery fire in 2014 (Reference (3)). The degree of hazard depends on the battery size (i.e., current and voltage) and energy density. For example, the robot battery had ten times the amp hours as a cellphone and 200 times the watt-hours (Reference (5), page 3). High capacity, aerospace-qualified, high-reliability, prismatic, rechargeable Li-ion cells (as compared to these commercial pouch cells that lack adequate certification, safety features and manufacturer traceability) are an essential part of power systems used across NASA. This includes flight use in MSL, MAVEN, Mars 2020, OSIRIS-Rex, Juno, Grail, Space Station, Atlas 5, THEMIS, GOES-R, Launch Abort Systems (140V battery packs with 15 Ah capacity), and EM-1 Crew Module (120V battery with 30 Ah) applications. Given that the robot fire was avoidable if some of the warning signs had been recognized, Reference (5) identified the following contributing causes of the mishap: Video evidence and data suggested the battery voltage was anomalously low during storage prior to the charging event, indicative of cells with possible internal soft-shorts. The battery was deep charged while mounted in the robot, without a BMS, instead of on the test stand. The battery design was inadequate. The cell selection was inappropriate. The vendor-specification battery was modified at JPL. Li-ion battery charging was performed in a fully-occupied\/multi-use laboratory without adequate safety provisions. The charge current was set too high. No over-voltage or over-temperature alarm was provided for the robot. The robot was given a non-functioning and inadequate BMS. The robot had no voltage monitoring and control for individual cells. The Li-ion battery exceeded the recommended external operating temperature. Reference (5) provides an additional lesson learned: Li-ion battery purchasing controls are essential. Input from the JPL line organization suggests that: The design, selection, and operational risks of large, energy-dense batteries may be significantly allayed by project recourse to battery experts in the line organization.","Lesson ID":23701}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"It is likely (Reference (4)) that the failure of the RapidScat payload on the ISS was due in part to unanticipated removal of power resulting in voltage spikes caused by possible system-generated or self- induced inductive kickback. The behavior of EMI filter components downstream of switches can pose a threat in the event of sudden power removal. The effect of long cable runs, such as those found in the ISS, must also be considered. Models of source impedances cannot always be counted on to genuinely represent behavior in off-nominal situations. Voltage clamping is a technique used to limit the amplitude of a transient across a circuit by clipping off the over-voltage spikes at a safe level. The behavior of an external power subsystem that is designed by an outside organization may not be as well understood by JPL instrument designers as the power subsystem in a JPL spacecraft. The RapidScat failure mechanism represents a credible vulnerability for JPL\u2019s upcoming ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission.","Lesson ID":23201}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Success in ultra-high risk endeavors depends as much on rigorous attention to positive behavior patterns as it does on compliance with \u201cgood sense\u201d rules. Because they may be perceived by a flight project as costly, it is prudent to formally recognize the value of proven successful engineering behavior patterns and to tout them as lessons learned.","Lesson ID":22601}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"CoF projects that effect element subsystems must provide a Human Factors Engineering Assessment (HFEA) evaluating the human interaction with the subsystem against relevant human factors criteria. Human factor findings can identify potential adverse operation impacts. The HFEA should be updated as the project matures to indicate evidence that each applicable requirement has been verified. This process was not followed and therefore changes need to be made to the SOW process to capture these processes and requirements.","Lesson ID":22501}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The MSL project history suggests that: The JPL design maxim of \u201ctest as you fly, fly as you test\u201d was not heeded (Reference (7), Slide 28). Because the MSL wheel was life tested at the single-wheel level, representative loads over life from inter-mobility forces were not achieved. Also, the wheel was life tested over smooth, artificial terrain that under-represented the ventifacted (wind-sharpened) bedrock encountered on Mars (Reference (7), Slide 28), and testing did not account for the impact of rock immobility. Analytical modeling and testing of mobility systems need to expand on the range of load cases to encompass our evolving understanding of worst case operational environments, with margin.","Lesson ID":22401}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"You can\u2019t anticipate every problem you will see in extended mission operations. This type of battery anomaly had been seen in the laboratory, but never before on-orbit. Design tradeoffs and choices made in the development phases may have implications for the operations phase (Phase E). Though they would have facilitated anomaly recovery, the cost-constrained CloudSat project eliminated gyros from the flight system design during Phase B. Due to unanticipated launch delays, CloudSat launched with a battery that had aged after its activation. The CloudSat spacecraft battery design did not permit the independent switching (off) of cells, so the spare cells could not be used due to the risk of overcharge during sunlight. Robust spacecraft fault protection (i.e., load shedding during under-voltage events) and redundancy (i.e., the receiver and Power Distribution Unit (PDU)) were critical to spacecraft survival. Instead of being used for redundancy, one PDU was reassigned to control charging and the other to control UV limits, thereby enabling lower UV fault settings. A failure in one system can cause other failures: the battery UV condition caused the loss of Receiver #1. Following the anomaly, JPL project management, the system subcontractor, and the U.S. Air Force quickly drew in experienced personnel to assist in anomaly resolution. This included veteran CloudSat project design engineers thoroughly acquainted with the spacecraft systems and experienced operations personnel familiar with CloudSat on-orbit operations. It\u2019s always about the people Experience \u2013 we had the best people with real experience Imagination \u2013 out-of-the-box thinkers Teamwork Determination Luck is sometimes part of the solution: CloudSat has just enough (~5A) current available during eclipse to make DOOp work. The NASA program manager was very supportive in providing the funding needed for CloudSat mission recovery.","Lesson ID":22502}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The SMAP mission is the first JPL mission to achieve fully lights-out operation for all routine operations. The SMAP approach to operations autonomy borrowed concepts from 10 years of JPL experience with automated operation of the GDS for the Jason-1 and WISE missions. (Jason-1 and WISE proved \u201clights out\u201d conceptually, but they did not commit to it for routine operations.) SMAP has achieved more than 90 percent lights-out commanding while achieving a level of operational responsiveness that would normally require round-the-clock staffing. The approach used can apply to all missions including both Earth-orbiting missions, which do not always use multi-mission services, and deep space missions.","Lesson ID":22101}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Due to the material stackup in a typical ISIM thermal strap joint, the bolted joints relaxed over time during ground processing. Indium flows, and aluminum 1100 and high purity aluminum foils all distort under a compressive load. Threaded inserts in aluminum 1100 under a tensile load exhibit material creep at room temperature. This was observed to be one of the largest drivers in joint relaxation due to higher stresses in the parent material around the threaded insert, worsening the material creep.4 Although re-torquing helped to mitigate indium flow-out, re-torquing in excess exacerbated the material creep and distortion. This material behavior degraded mechanical stability of the joint as it lost preload over time. Accounting for bolted joint preload loss over time, by characterizing material creep at room temperature and indium spacer flow-out, as well as prescribing minimum and maximum torques and a re-torque schedule to maintain acceptable joint preload at cryogenic temperatures4,5, was critical in ensuring mechanical integrity and thermal performance during on-ground and mission lifecycles.","Lesson ID":22003}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Patch releases may not be available when exploits are identified. Teams should be prepared to handle these types of situations. Incident drills are a useful tool, but at the end of the day the most important asset is the ability of the team to respond to the issue at hand efficiently and effectively. The development and operations teams must be well-coordinated. DevOps working models are highly recommended and ensure constant collaboration and involvement between the two teams. Both teams should have a strong understanding of the roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of members of each team, and should be familiar with working together to overcome issues. Active monitoring of common security bulletin networks, and even software-specific bulletins, may not be sufficient in order to identify zero-day vulnerabilities. Additional, specific information avenues should be explored for crucial software components. Commercial intrusion detection \/ prevention mechanisms and web application firewalls may not monitor certain attack vectors. Each application must be analyzed based on its individual components in order to determine which aspects need additional monitoring, and these monitoring devices should be tailored to the application.","Lesson ID":21301}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Ballistic barriers are commonly emplaced to secure electrical transformers and other utilities that may generate high potential energy. For Building 159, however, there were no solid barriers (other than the sheet metal guard in Figures 1 and 2) between the equipment and the vicinity exterior to the building. The likelihood of a component being hurled through a fairly small window\u2014the building\u2019s only point of vulnerability\u2014was likely viewed as low. But the lack of a protective mesh cover on the window allowed a pump component to be propelled with great velocity through the glass window and onto a part of the JPL campus. (A protective mesh screen was subsequently placed over the Building 159 window, and the sheet metal guards over the motor\/pump couplings (Figures 1 and 2) have been replaced with thicker sheet metal.) The root cause of the Building 159 Pump House incident was likely the replacement of a critical mechanical piece part in a commercial pump with a used replacement part that had a different configuration and did not match the pump manufacturer\u2019s part number. In addition, Reference (1) reports finding old hammer marks on the coupling hub, indicating that it had been hammered on and off the pump shaft at some point instead of using a puller or a press. Reference (1) identifies a number of pump design and operational errors, including selection of a motor that is possibly oversized or has excessive starting torque, relatively frequent pump starts and stops due to the programming of a one-inch deadband in the cistern, installation of an ill-fitting shaft key in the keyway that did not transmit torque over the full length of the hub, etc.","Lesson ID":20201}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"From this experience we learned that: Ensuring tight connections between load cell string components is critical to high quality force measurements. When assembling a load cell string it is difficult to detect a problem in the string tightness. The connections may feel tight, but may be due to the small size of the gap. This problem can be diagnosed by examining the screws and the corresponding holes in the mounting blocks for indications of wear consistent with the screw bottoming out. Dial indicators or linear differential variable transformers (LDVTs) can be used to detect the very small motions associated with this problem in situ. If this problem is found, it can usually be remedied using a thin washer between the screw head and the shoulder of the counterbore.","Lesson ID":18701}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Hard shutdowns are common protection mechanisms for vibration hardware and they can impose an undesirable shock to the test article. Random signal inputs into vibration tables may be perceived as excessive accelerations in certain conditions. In many cases, a vibration overtest event may happen prior to the planned start of the test, causing an overtest stress where the vibration levels are not measured. Small signs of problems and out of family behavior of vibration equipment frequently indicates that a serious problem is emerging. An environmental test performed without expectation or preparation for a failure or anomaly is likely to be a test performed in vain.","Lesson ID":18601}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Understanding the integration flow beforehand allowed the MMS team to understand where flexibility existed and what could be traded by rearranging activities. The MMS I&T plans evolved as the project team got smarter and reacted to issues (e.g. many components such as Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) instruments and navigators were de-integrated for further testing or rework). The MMS project intentionally built flexibility into their I&T plan and activities. As a result, the project was able to accommodate many changes because of the flexibility built into their I&T plan and processes. For instance, the MMS project plan was able to absorb the change of performing T-Vac at GSFC to shipment offsite for T-Vac at the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).","Lesson ID":19601}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"A crowbar is a fail-safe protection mechanism for electronic circuits, usually placed across a power supply\u2019s output terminals, that short circuits the output of a power supply under such failure conditions as overvoltage or overcurrent. The life of the AMSU-A2 instrument might have been extended if crowbars had been in place to protect vulnerable components in the power switches and in the DC-DC converter. AMSUs are in common use: about 15 are in use on NOAA weather satellites, etc.","Lesson ID":19501}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"In a magnetics cleanliness program, the primary area of concern is with contributions from ferromagnetic materials, including nickel. These \u201chard\u201d magnetic materials are difficult to demagnetize, and the JPL practice (Reference (3)) is to avoid them, use them in limited numbers, or demagnetize them in strong fields prior to final assembly. The potential for electrically conductive polyimide tape, widely used on JPL missions, to become magnetized due to its nickel content was not recognized by the Juno project. Nickel alloy can take a magnetic charge at low phosphorus levels, and the phosphorous content used by vendors over the last few years has varied. Since there may be some variability in the nickel alloy used in polyimide tape adhesive, wire wrapping foil, and other products, it behooves projects to test nickel-content material for its magnetic properties prior to use. Even materials contained in the end item that seem harmless should appear on the Material Identification Usage List (MIUL) (Reference (4)).","Lesson ID":18901}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Ceramic chip capacitors from all manufacturers can experience cracking that may lead to degradation or failure under thermal and mechanical conditions that may be considered benign and consistent with proven standards. Damage may occur from activities such as solder joint touchups, rework and repair, installation of neighboring parts, or mechanical handling of boards that may include flexing.","Lesson ID":18502}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"A long record of mission success is no assurance that safety was handled properly or that future operations will be safe. Also, the absence of safety incidents is not an indicator of safe processes. An observation, through audit, assessment, or happenstance, that an activity is unsafe should be sufficient to elevate the concern to the appropriate authority until the unsafe activity is discontinued or corrected and verified to be safe. A mission organization should not be responsible for classifying its own mishaps. Leaving an organization or project responsible for classifying its own mishaps gives rise to an increased likelihood of contamination of evidence for incident response, misclassification, incomplete investigations, missed lessons, and failure to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. For an audit or assessment to have full value, there must be a closed loop process of providing recommendations, validating that corrective actions have been implemented, and elevating the issue for any recommendation that is not satisfactorily addressed in a timely manner. Neither a project\u2019s mission success risk posture nor funding constraints should have bearing on its implementation of safety.","Lesson ID":18503}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Pay attention to the weather ahead of time. The team should have anticipated the potential impact of headwinds and could have planned for more fuel for refueling in the air or for two refueling events in the air.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Triple redundancy for items in flash memory is a simple and uniform way of identifying memory corruption in space. The advantage to triple redundancy is the ability to detect which copy of a file is corrupt, and correct it either autonomously or by command. Combining triple redundancy with a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) allows the software to determine which files have been corrupt, and to ensure that files are correctly read, even when they are read by voting the contents of the three copies. The IAM flight software images are triple redundant. Triple redundancy is simpler and more uniform than the implementation of double redundancy in the IAM flight software. In the case of double redundancy there was a main and redundant copy, while for triple redundancy all copies were equal. Having code to treat each copy differently added some complexity because with double redundancy there is no ability to vote, so there is a need for some other strategy like nominating one as the main. In this case all data had CRCs, so it was not a problem of determining which copy to use, only that having non-equal treatment of each copy meant that the code needed special cases to distinguish between the two copies. For us, the trade was in available space \u2013 the only advantage of double redundancy would have been less space used. This was not an issue in this specific case, so we would have been better off using triple redundancy for all items stored in flash memory.","Lesson ID":18803}

These supporting applications (and associated documentation) must be then configuration controlled just like the software being developed. The configuration control needs to account for any changes to the installed or uninstalled versions. In order to verify the required information exists, the first formal test of the developed software should start from a generic hardware platform and then load the required supporting drivers to verify the installation\/build process.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"WRIs are notoriously non-linear in stiffness, and their properties and responses change with input load level. Isolator testing done at LaRC by the Project found the stiffness values quoted in the vendor data were not accurate, particularly for the load levels for which they would be used on the CMP. Compared to 2% critical damping used in normal dynamic analysis, the damping with the WRIs was found to be much higher and vary considerably, with as much as 15% damping at low frequencies (0-250 Hz) and around 8% at higher frequencies (250-2000 Hz). When the variable damping schedule and corrected stiffnesses were used in the analysis models, the model results more closely matched the system test results (CMP on isolators). The results of this testing and analysis is published in \u201cThree-Dimensional Vibration Isolator for Suppressing High-Frequency Responses for Sage III Contamination Monitoring Package (CMP)\u201d, Yingyong Li, et al., NAFEMS World Congress 2015; 21-24 Jun. 2015; San Diego, CA (Accession Number N160006289 on https:\/\/ntrl.ntis.gov\/NTRL\/).

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Prior to 1988 no industry standard existed providing specific guidelines for determining functional margin of frangible devices. In May 1988, Laurence J. Bement and Morry L. Schimmel published the results of a Multi-organizational committee with representatives from Government and industry including NASA, Air Force, Aerospace Corp, Lockheed, General Dynamics, Boeing, and JPL team documenting the results of an investigation of two test failures of Super*Zip hardware. This NASA memo, NASA TM-4031, \u201cInvestigations of Super*Zip Separation Joint,\u201d also specified that dimensional\/material variability must be considered as part of a test program for frangible joint fracture margin. NASA TM-4031 (1988) was the most current\/relevant knowledge on center-notch frangible joints in 1992 when OSC developed the A-series frangible joint (as an improvement of Super*Zip). NASA LSP\u2019s investigation determined that the lessons learned published in 1988 was discovered to have relevance to the T8\/T9 failures but LSP\u2019s in-depth investigation actually quantified this lesson learned for the specific Taurus frangible joint design and discovered that even very small dimensional and small material property differences can have a large effect on fracture performance. The investigation into the T8\/T9 failures determined development, qualification and production of a frangible joint are key areas which are critical to its successful functioning. In summary, the findings are that a frangible joint is highly sensitive to critical dimensions and material properties. Contributors to the failures were in the areas of development, qualification and production of a frangible joint. Frangible joint designers and manufacturers need to implement specific screens and inspections as well as testing at the \u201ccorners of the operating box\u201d for each frangible joint design. The \u201ccorners of the operating box\u201d for fracture reliability are the combination of minimum and maximum extrusion ligament thickness dimensions and material properties. Process controls during manufacturing are also critical to ensure the joint functions as designed and tested.","Lesson ID":15702}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"There exists a trend of incidents (see References (5) and (6)) with JPL building utility anomalies posing a threat to JPL products, and the JPL critical facility list does not appear to have been effective in forestalling them. Indeed, ceiling leaks from clogged humidifier or air conditioning drains are fairly commonplace at JPL (References (7) through (10)). For example, in March 2006 (Reference (7)), a wet ceiling tile fell, narrowly missing the Power Processing Unit (PPU) test area for the Dawn project (Figures 1 and 2). Without proactive steps as JPL buildings age, problems like corroded pipes (Reference (11)) and leaky roofs could become more prevalent. JPL facility safety surveys are intended to focus on laboratory-specific issues like ESD protection and use of protective goggles, rather than on building maintenance issues. Figure 2. General location of DAWN mishap Figure 3. Configuration of Dawn PPU\/ion engine Digital Control & Interface Unit (DCIU) test lab during mishap It is an accepted practice to perform Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to identify all potential failure modes that could be induced by ground support equipment. For example, the project seeks to assure that the power output of commercial test equipment cannot in any circumstance damage the flight equipment to which it is connected (Reference (12)). Similarly, system safety engineers at the launch site verify that the air conditioning routed to a launch shroud cannot serve as a source of payload contamination (Reference (13)). However, there is a demarcation of responsibility where testbed safety is evaluated by aerospace engineers while building utilities are vouchsafed by building construction and maintenance personnel. For example, FMEA is a specialized reliability engineering task that is not typically performed on building utilities.","Lesson ID":17701}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Need to simplify the CM recovery operation. Numerous lessons learned specified that the operation was too complex, required excessive communications, was hampered by competing shipboard operations and requires two separate movements to place the CM into the designated recovery cradle.

The Recovery Team lessons learned noted that the CM cleats need to be stronger and facilitate quick application of recovery support equipment, the bumper pads on the recovery cradle were not built to withstand loads imparted in the well deck, the winch used to recover the CM into the well deck was inadequate, and the recovery transportation fixture required modifications to be suitable for CM overland transport from San Diego to Kennedy Space Center. Need to review methods of integrating trained personnel to accomplish the mission.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Reference (2) summarizes the lessons learned from development and test of the SMAP RBA: The Deployable Reflector is a critical element in an Integrated Flight System. A deployable reflector is a major consideration for practically all aspects of spacecraft configuration. It needs to fit the launch vehicle in the stowed configuration, deploy without obstruction, and allow unobstructed illumination of solar panels and unobstructed fields of view of instruments and telecom antennas, etc. The large flexible nature of the deployed antenna produces vibration modes (of order 1 Hz or lower) and could potentially couple with fuel slosh modes, solar array modes, or deployable boom modes. Sudden thermal transients that appear when crossing the terminator can produce dynamic disturbances. A large deployable reflector imposes constraints and special conditions on mission operational scenarios such as deployment (typically conducted with the Attitude Control System (ACS) idled, and constrained by power availability as the spacecraft tumbles off-sun during deployment), slews for calibration, tumble recovery maneuvers, etc. Verification and validation by analysis is required. Verification by testing only will not suffice. V&V of the integrated system under environmental conditions cannot be accomplished by testing alone, a characteristic of large deployable structures that is shared by systems such as planetary Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL). The structures are simply too large for most facilities, too strongly influenced by Earth\u2019s gravity, or too costly to make testing a viable option. Important exceptions (where test is viable) include system-level environmental testing with the deployable in the stowed configuration, and first-motion and possibly full deployment tests of the structure alone at room temperature and possibly under vacuum, assisted by gravity-offload test fixtures. Validation of many project requirements requires extensive use of models, and the models themselves need to be validated. Waivers to established test practices should be developed early in a project\u2019s lifecycle. The waivers should explain anticipated exceptions and planned mitigations, and provide a documented risk assessment and institutional approvals. The waivers should be updated throughout development. Be critical of heritage claims, as each deployable reflector will be a custom implementation. Although the deployable structure will exhibit heritage elements, and previous performance will be important in selecting a vendor partner, such factors as the choice of launch vehicle are likely to cause design changes-- even for reflectors of the same diameter. Scaling in structure size can generate emergent behaviors which are not understood until testing, at which time they could seriously threaten the technical performance and schedule. Even minor modifications to heritage components or to functional performance can significantly change system behavior. Vendor heritage can also be threatened by changes in vendor personnel and technical capabilities. Critical examination of the heritage of models, test fixtures, ground support equipment, and manufacturing capabilities is also needed The depth of the vendor\/partner capabilities is important. During the source selection process, consideration should be given to the engineering and production capacity of the candidate suppliers for the scope of work being considered, including engineering capacity, manufacturing capacity, quality assurance, acquisition, management, contracts, personnel, facilities and key equipment. Projects should forecast the suppliers\u2019 management, engineering, and production and test resource capacity to accommodate possible scope or complexity growth as the job evolves over time. Determine how much of vendor capacity the project consumes, whether the company is gaining critical talent or losing it, if the vendor has multiple customers, and how the customer mission ranks in priority against other customers\u2019 deliveries. There were previous projects that involved a known, once competent vendor, but where the vendor\u2019s current capabilities proved questionable-- such as the Dawn ion engines and the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) actuators. Vendor partner management practices contributed to the difficulties. The vendor organization structure can aid or hinder system development. Also, the RBA contractor\u2019s test processes did not provide as strong attention to early ground test and deployment modeling as was warranted. Carefully planned contract details can ease off-nominal situations. Vague or permissive language in contract SOWs and CDRLs can lead to delays in discovering vendor performance problems. Even when contract requirements are clearly written, however, additional JPL engagement may aid in attaining full vendor employee awareness of what JPL expects from them\u2014and the rationale. Reference (3) provides another perspective on what worked well and what didn't work well in SMAP RBA development.","Lesson ID":16501}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"NASA engineers face a challenge in obtaining electronic parts suitable for spaceflight applications. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts, including memory devices, are designed for low cost, high performance, and low power\u2014not for error detection. High density memory devices are not manufactured to meet NASA radiation hardness requirements. Hence, whenever NASA adopts a new type of non-radiation tolerant commercial memory device, such as cellphone-type memory for small spacecraft, radiation-induced errors arise. As these part vulnerabilities are sometimes predictable, spaceflight projects need to understand them and mitigate their impacts. Whenever JPL has adopted a new memory part or a new type of digital memory, unexpected part behaviors have resulted. Examples have included manufacturing issues (Galileo TC244 parts), architectural issues (Cassini Solid State Recorder high double bit error rates), bit failures (EEPROM weak bits), and in this case SEFIs.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Since mechanism life tests may run for years and thus must start early in system development, it is important for the designers to fully understand the conditions under which the mechanism will operate in spaceflight and assure that they are encompassed by the test design (i.e., test-as-you-plan-to-fly). The life qualification testing of the Dawn TGA actuator assembly was insufficient because the test protocol was not representative of the mission usage. Mechanical engineers are commonly aware that actuator mechanical parts may dither over a very small range of travel, resulting in greater wear than might result from the large sweep angles that tend to redistribute lubricant.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Ensure that adequate spare parts are obtained during design and development to support the needs of Verification and Validation testing. Logistics Supportability Analyses need to be completed well before the start of Verification and Validation testing in order to allow adequate time for long-lead spares procurement. This requires early involvement of Logistics in the design process to identify potential long-lead spares and requires that late design changes be minimized. Requirements definition needs to be completed and requirements creep controlled to allow a timely end to design changes so that the logistics analyses can be finalized. The reuse of existing hardware in a new system needs to be coordinated with Logistics to identify any obsolescence issues in the reused hardware. Ensure that designs are completed, closed out and placed under configuration management with adequate time in the schedule to support both procurement of the system and procurement of spare parts. Late design changes must be thoroughly evaluated and this evaluation must include impacts to fabrication contracts and to procurement of long-lead items. In situations where spare parts are purchased for a system and the parts need to be modified to be used in the system, the modifications to the parts need to be completed prior to putting them into logistics inventory. This avoids situations where a spare part is pulled from logisticsinventory and the required modifications cause cost and schedule issues.","Lesson ID":14701}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"It was clear that the UAV pilot did not know several key flight critical parameters that a pilot should know in order to execute a flight test. Chief among them were maximum landing speed and maximum flight time at cruise power. The ground support crew used a complex pre-flight check list and skipped a key step that reduced the thrust time rate-of-change to be less than expected by the pilot, resulting in a longer take off roll, and a re-contact with the runway during departure. Steps in checklists may be missed if the checklist is overly complex. There was no independent or second check that each step in the pre-flight checklist was executed. The pre-flight checklist did not include a briefing of flight critical parameters to the pilot. The pilot was new to this UAV. The pilot's lack of knowledge in a key area of engine thrust trim contributed to the pilot's perception of off nominal thrust performance during the flight. The flight crew did not give the pilot real time warnings when flight critical parameters were being exceeded due to the erroneous assumption that the pilot was familiar with the parameters. UAV pilots cannot be expected to make the best decisions when operating with incomplete or erroneous knowledge of critical flight parameters. Flight crews tend to dislike protective barriers between themselves and the UAV, thinking that they can quickly move out of the path of an oncoming UAV during a loss of control incident.","Lesson ID":1710}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"As counterfeiting of aerospace parts and materials has become increasingly commonplace (Reference (3), flight system and instrument developers must exercise a high level of vigilance and institute screening processes that are sufficiently rigorous to counter the risk. Certain distributors have delivered final Ti product forms as plate material that has been cut from intermediate product forms without the necessary additional thermo-mechanical working. This substandard practice is referred to as \u201ccut down billet.\u201d The certification data associated with these final product forms were incomplete, contained some omissions and irregularities, or were derived from test coupons drawn from prime locations within the intermediate products that may not be representative of the cross section from which the final products were obtained. Non-conforming Ti material was confirmed from at least two commercial distributors. There has been no indication of improper Ti alloy processing by mills or conversion houses. (Material \u201cdistributors\u201d typically do not have the thermal-mechanical processing equipment necessary to perform forging or hot rolling operations. Mills and conversion houses typically have such equipment.) Fifty JPL spacecraft and instrument projects were assessed and ultimately cleared of the possibility of having used non-conforming Ti by a combination of refined margin analysis, component testing, and\/or redesign. Although the tested material property non-conformance was relatively small, measures have been implemented by JPL to prevent non-conforming Ti material from entering its supply chain. (The non-conformance involved approximately a 5 percent reduction in ultimate tensile strength and a 10 percent reduction in tensile yield strength that in most cases was covered by the factor of safety employed by JPL.)","Lesson ID":12901}

In the case of the UPS-1 system, it had not been maintained over the two years since it was installed. Battery defects are not easy to predict. There were no procedures in place for facility personnel and facility users to respond to the symptoms of battery overheating. The UPS-1 system was not equipped with adequate fault sensor safeguards, such as cell temperature and voltage measurements, to warn of cells in thermal runaway. Also, the system lacked malfunction or over-voltage alarms for timely recognition of malfunctions, and it lacked automatic shutoffs for battery overcharging.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Foundational documents, critical for the initial planning and subsequent control of project activities, should be developed and widely distributed, published and advertised to the team early in the process. For projects limited in manpower and financial resources, these foundational documents will be equally limited in their complexity, but they should exist from the beginning of the project to provide guidance to the entire team. A clear flight certification process is needed for COTS hardware. Qualification requirements for all disciplines need to be clearly and explicitly stated up front. The approval process for changes can burden the flow of work with unnecessary steps if it is not tailored to the size, scope, and complexity of the project. Approval process for changes should be agreed to at the beginning of the project in line with configuration management for the size and scope of the project. Wise use of analyses and evaluation of interfaces at all stages of the life cycle can save time and resource expenditures during build, test, and milestone reviews. During any design, development, integration and test project that has a compressed schedule, it is essential for the team to communicate to avoid having the hardware wait for the next step in the process. Coordination is needed between MSFC and JSC Export Control offices. Seek out local (MSFC) help with database inputs before going to JSC for help. A payload with a normal schedule, would not have the issues with parts lists, Interface Control Document (ICD), manifest requests, and LRODS that we had on ISERV. Parallel development of the products is very difficult and fraught with potential mistakes. Check internally to see if another project, such as Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG), might have experience with the system\/database. Using COTS equipment, while faster to procure, requires extra testing and communication to ensure it meets standards, which must be factored into the schedule. To meet implied requirements, minimum NASA standards must be met, which implies additional quality engineering support, specific test requirements, and part traceability. It is a good idea to get S&MA involved up front, even if only to understand the qualification requirements that may be encountered when the hardware needs to be integrated into the higher class system. If too many assumptions about the plug-and-play nature of the equipment and supporting hardware are made up front, the team will spend more hours reiterating design and testing activities. Assuming that COTS is faster and cheaper without understanding the implied requirements unnecessarily increases the risk of not meeting schedule, budget, and delivery agreements.","Lesson ID":7217}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Integrating COTS equipment on Class D hardware into the ISS WORF rack requires attention to ISS requirements and the attendant pedigree traceability, verification, and validation requirements more typical of Class A and B hardware. Project teams need to be aware of these implied requirements when integrating Class D hardware onto a Class A facility. Using COTS equipment is not necessarily cheaper. To meet implied requirements, minimum NASA standards must be met, which implies additional quality engineering support, specific test requirements, and part traceability. It is a good idea to get S&MA involved up front, even if only to understand the qualification requirements that may be encountered when the hardware needs to be integrated into the higher class system. If too many assumptions about the plug-and-play nature of the equipment and supporting hardware are made up front, the team will spend more hours reiterating design and testing activities. Assuming that COTS is per print without understanding the implied requirements unnecessarily increases the risk of not meeting schedule, budget, and delivery agreements. Inconsistent configuration and part dimensions and lack of configuration control on COTS equipment by the vendor drives the need for additional care and investigation of purchased hardware. An additional unit should be purchased as an engineering evaluation unit that can be taken apart and investigated for identifying and quantifying unknown differences. Purchase of a fourth unit for engineering evaluation would have enabled the team to trouble shoot unanticipated configuration and design issues without affecting the critical path or the constraining rework schedule that induced the quick turnaround rework situation. The project team cannot assume that purchased units will be identical or that all information relevant to the design project will be provided accurately from the vendor. Engineering evaluation units should undergo some environmental tests early in the project cycle to identify any deficiencies in design, construction, and pertinent engineering data. Any payload, be it COTS or otherwise, must meet interfaces, which ISERV did. A clear flight certification process is needed for COTS hardware. Qualification requirements for all disciplines need to be clearly and explicitly stated up front. Wise use of analyses and evaluation of interfaces at all stages of the life cycle can save time and resource expenditures during build, test, and milestone reviews. The agreement to use COTS needs to be multi-disciplined with an understanding of the safety and risk implications with limited engineering data on the equipment and less rigorous early-in-life-cycle processes to define and accept the risk.","Lesson ID":7216}

Because JPL is making increasing use of in situ experimentation, as well as new composites and coatings, operations-induced wear and heating of mechanisms may generate unexpected products.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Laboratory testing revealed higher than anticipated safety risks from a potential arc-flash event in a manhole environment when conducted at KSC\u2019s unreduced fault current levels. The safety risks included bright flash, excessive sound, and smoke. Due to these findings and absence of other mitigations installed at the time, manhole entries require full arc-flash PPE. Furthermore, manhole entries were temporarily restricted to short duration inspections until further mitigations could be implemented. With installation of neutral grounding resistors (NGRs) on substation transformers, the flash, sound and flame energy was reduced. The hazard reduction was so substantial that the required PPE would be less cumbersome and enable effective performance of maintenance tasks in the energized configuration. With the NGR installed, the surge arresters currently used at KSC are not designed for the load and may fail during a fault causing secondary outages and increasing repair times. Replacement of the surge arresters will be conducted over 2-3 years due to the resulting hundreds of facility outages and impacts. Until the surge suppressors are upgraded, the NGRs would only be used during manhole construction and maintenance operations in an approved outage period.","Lesson ID":9501}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Type II black anodization of aluminum is commonly performed by JPL and by industry to provide a durable coating for corrosion control or to minimize glint for cameras. Although anodizing aluminum alloys by this technique is usually successful, the compatibility of certain aluminum alloys with the Type II anodize process is unpredictable. Although the coating failures caused no damage to MSL, contamination from the resulting debris can potentially have serious mission consequences. There is some evidence that factors such as exposure of the anodized surface to extreme low-side temperature cycles (e.g., to -130C), and the deep thermal cycling associated with planetary protection measures, may affect the tendency of the coating to spall. For component surfaces that experience relatively benign total thermal variations, or for missions that do not require planetary protection bakeout, it may be feasible to specify and deliver a reliable Type II black anodize coating on 2000 and 7000 series aluminum alloys for a given flight project.","Lesson ID":8403}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Reflight of a system design is becoming a more common JPL practice. For example, the Mars 2020 mission concept under study by NASA would duplicate the successful design of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. (If the prospective Mars 2020 flight system is not designed as an exact copy of MSL, it would likely retain major MSL elements like the Descent Stage; Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) design; and Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG)). In addition, NASA is supporting the use of common spacecraft buses (e.g., LADEE, Cubesats) that will facilitate reflight of a standard flight system design. The JPL focus on primarily one-of-a-kind flight systems and missions may result in insufficient priority placed on design documentation and mission-centric knowledge retention. However, much technical knowledge gained over the course of a JPL project is reusable, and the actual reflight of a spacecraft design is not uncommon (e.g., Mars Polar Lander\/Mars Phoenix, Jason-1\/Jason-2\/Jason-3, OCO\/OCO-2, Mars Science Laboratory\/proposed Mars 2020 mission).

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The prime contractor took several opportunities to help reduce cost to the Transition and Retirement (T & R) program as well as to reduce schedule. The following improvements implemented in the September 2011 time frame helped the prime contractor become more efficient in the Property Excess process. Approval to stage tooling in locations outside of bonded stores allowed more work to be accomplished simultaneously and minimized the limitation of available space in the Excess warehouse. NASA requested on the prime contractor\u2019s behalf and received a waiver from Defense Contact Management Agency (DCMA) to allow the prime to exceed a requirement without punishment. The requirement involved the 30-day time limit to dispose of property once a disposition is given. The contractual requirement involving the 30-day limit spawned another requirement that limited the number of entries allowed into the property transition\/disposal system, the Plant Clearance Automated Reutilization Screening System (PCARSS). The document designated for entering an item for transition\/excess is a DD1149. To comply with the requirement, a DD1149 could only be written and input into the system to cover the amount of property that could be Excessed in a month. For example, if it took 1 person 1 day to excess a bin, the maximum number of bins that could be excessed in a month was 20-25. One DD1149 could be written to excess only those 20-25 bins. To excess all 635 bins, 24 to 28 DD1149\u2019s would have to have been written and processed. DCMA took, on average, 60 to 90 days to run each DD1149 through the PCARSS system. With the waiver, they were able to front load the system, entering one DD149 for property, such as the 635 bins. The 635 bins took 3 to 4 months to prepare for Excess. Frontloading significantly reduced the amount of data entry, redundant paperwork, and coordination required, reducing the lag time between prime contractor and DCMA activities. RSRM had some property that was used in direct contact with rocket propellant. Special procedures, called 5Xing, to clean the hardware are required prior to transferring or excessing hardware to someone outside the company. Front loading the system reduced the processing time needed to start, as well as streamlining the schedule after approval. Eliminating the need to re-tag material with paper tags by allowing PKAB (RSRM) tags to be equal to R006 (SLS) upon transfer completion streamlined the process of transferring hardware between contracts. Property ownership transfer records were made electronically in the material database (Impresa). This reduced the amount of physical labor and quality control required to re-tag all internally transitioned hardware. Bringing in temporary employees by hiring former employees with the needed experience to expedite closeout efforts in the prime contractor warehouse known as Stores. Utilizing former employees with the specific knowledge, experience, and skills regarding hardware and other property helped the T&R team meet an aggressive Excessing schedule and accelerated the completion of transfers. An IT team led by the Property Disposition team built a time-saving bridge from the prime contractor\u2019s system, Impresa, to DCMA\u2019s PCARSS, which streamlined the material entry process to a single date entry task for each property unit instead of repeating the same data entry task into each property management system. In the Materials Excess review process, the time allowance for Program Management review was reduced from 10 days to 5 days. Unnecessary steps were also eliminated, reducing the wait time throughout this review process.","Lesson ID":6976}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Electrical outages in data centers and other critical facilities that are triggered in error may have a major impact on critical NASA operations. Two weeks prior to the Building 600 incident, a server outage (Reference (2)), caused loss of telemetry flow to an MSL testbed during operational readiness testing. The Building 600 incident might have had even more serious consequences had it occurred in an MSL command and telemetry processing facility because the MSL spacecraft was due to launch in another three months. Especially water-sensitive facilities like major data centers and museums are known to require special (i.e., double-interlock, preaction) fire suppression systems. Although JPL is continuing to install double-lock isolated systems in major data centers where appropriate (e.g., the new data center in Building 230), they are not suitable for all data processing facilities. (Small rooms with one or two servers may not warrant special measures, and a gas suppression system (e.g., halon) is often preferable for data centers.)

This has been time consuming and has resulted in un-necessary testing and discussions. Many times the decision had to be made using data that was lacking completeness or was inconclusive.","Lesson ID":4416}

Responsibility for ensuring that work products comply with, and meet the standards of quality, validity and requirements, reside at each level of management and designated governing authority in the hierarchy of authority. Formal detailed verification requirements (DVRs) need to be strongly linked with individual tests and analyses. Insight\/oversight teams need to be reviewing technical work by contractors and subcontractors on an ongoing basis.

A simple piping fix could reduce this risk if the lower cavity where leaking hydrogen gas can accumulate were designed to purge residual hydrogen to well below the critical level. This would prevent the condition where hydrogen in the GUCP cavity causes a launch scrub.","Lesson ID":6150}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Residual hydrogen in certain locations in feed systems for liquid propulsion can create potentially catastrophic conditions at launch. Piping design and plumbing practices affect the integrity of purge systems to completely purge critical propellant lines. The allowance of a length of piping between the helium injection connection to the dead-headed end of a hydrogen line does not allow the helium gas to purge all hydrogen vapor from the lines prior to launch. Experience on the Space Shuttle Program suggests the best practice is to connect the purge line to the propellant line as closely as possible to the dead headed end of the line to ensure complete purging on the line.","Lesson ID":6149}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Orbiter Engine ICD (13M15000) made no mention of Helium in the LH2 other than quantities allowed per the controlling document SE-S-0073, SPACE SHUTTLE SPECIFICATION, FLUID PROCUREMENT AND CONTROL (27 MAY 1999). This specification established the procurement requirements and the chemical and particulate limitations for fluids used in fluid systems of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB), External Tank (ET), Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), and Orbiter. This specification applied to payloads that have fluid interfaces with the Orbiter or Space Shuttle Ground Support Equipment (GSE). This specification applied throughout all program levels for commonality and to ensure that fluid requirements used for design concepts will be used in verification and operation. The intent and requirements of this specification applied equally to influents and to effluents to the extent specified herein. No testing of GHe ingestion into the LH2 system was ever performed on a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) because the condition of ingesting helium into the system was not addressed. In addition, at the time of the STS-128 launch attempt the SSME test program was over and there was no way to test an engine in the test stands. The rule of thumb on the Shuttle Program is Fly as you test and Test as you fly. Simulated tanking system testing was performed at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in an attempt to quantify how much Helium, if any, could be trapped in the Fill and Drain line. The combination of test results and the paucity of data regarding the capability of the SSME to tolerate GHe injestion resulted in the conclusion that if any Ghe (greater than zero GHe) is present in the system, no flight rationale is possible.","Lesson ID":6146}

Prior to final tie wrap installation to secure all the internal cable bundles and the movement to the vibe lab this cable was functioning properly. After extensive trouble shooting at GRC indicated a probable short or open, the cable was taken to the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC for further evaluation. Time Domain Reflectometry tests identified the conductor and location in the cable where an intermittent short existed. Destructive Physical Analysis confirmed the location of the short. Lack of detailed instructions in the process plan resulted in the omission of shrink tubing around the wires for protection when the backshell was installed. The technician who had been assembling the SpaceWire cables was away and his replacement was not aware the shrink tubing had to be installed as part of the assembly process.

The change in helium concentration can be used in conjunction with the purge effluent flow rate to derive a very accurate leak rate down to the 1 standard cubic inches per minute (SCIM) range.

Neither drawings, nor the experience from previous tests of the developing system, can be relied upon to identify interference points or close approaches during lift operations. In the case of the MSL mobility assembly lift, discovering the interference point between the flight hardware pin and the GSE would have required personnel watching the rotation from the rear of the GSE and knowing exactly where to look.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Continuous improvement enhancements identified include the following: Design to use convoluted metal bellows flex hoses to eliminate the Teflon lined flex hose moisture permeability issue. An important lesson learned from the UCTS is that corrosion-resistant steel reinforced braided Teflonlined flex hoses are permeable to atmospheric moisture where there is stagnant media and the vapor pressure of allowable moisture for the internal media is less than the vapor pressure of moisture in ambient air. This was significantly mitigated (but not solved) on the UCTS boom flex hoses using an inline dryer, vapor barrier tape, and modified processes (e.g., boom isolation to reduce amount of moisture transferred from the stagnant boom subsystem to the UCT module). Have a fixed recovery system at the vehicle interface for operational setup time reduction. Change the maximum allowable working pressure from 250 psig to 500 psig.

Also when using metal bellows flex hoses in an application where the hose extends and retracts it is important to ensure that the minimum bend radius is not exceeded and that there is no induced reverse bending occurring during the entire travel of the hose.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The most important lesson learned from these GH2 leaks is the need to understand and control process creep. Near the end of the Shuttle Program and after Hurricane Katrina hit Michoud Assembly Facility, KSC received several ETCAs whose configurations were out of tolerance. Some hinge brackets showed evidence of offset and slight clocking, and in some cases, the plate itself showed clocking. These minor deviations in assembly created enough of a stack-up problem to prevent the GUCP from tracking with the ETCA. Even though master tooling was used to manufacture the ETCA components, slight variations (which could have been avoided) were allowed to be introduced because the components were installed without the use of any indexing tooling. Another important lesson is the possibility of unintended consequences when design changes are implemented. The CRES 321 bellows was replaced with the Inconel 718 bellows to eliminate a fatigue problem and to reduce the number of parts and the refurbishment time. But the Inconel bellows was less able to track with the out-of-tolerance ETCA component installations. This change also added an unknown variable that was discovered during the investigation. Each bellows seemed to take a set during the QD assembly operation (minor offset from the flange to the probe). When the QD was stacked up with the out-of-tolerance ETCA and GUCP offset (misalignment), the cumulative concentricity differences among the components prevented the assembly from sealing at cryogenic temperatures. Another lesson is the importance of concentricity between the sealing surface and the bellows probe, as well as the rest of the assembly that could have an effect on it. The closer the concentricity offset between the sealing surface and the bellows probe is to 0, the more able the system will be to comply with (accommodate) external forces (e.g., vent line loads, wind, weather, and cryogenic loading). This understanding was instrumental in resolving the problem of the out-of-tolerance ETCA installations since the flight side could not be modified. For a critical fluid interface, the design should be such that the system excursions are experienced away from the sealing surface. The GUCA was designed to pivot about the pyrotechnic bolt, which caused the sealing surface to be dynamic. The sealing interface should have been maintained by solidly attaching the GUCP to the ETCA and allowing the flexhose to handle all the system excursions. In addition, the sealing interface was a single seal with no secondary sealing capability. A redundant seal configuration would have increased the system\u2019s compliance to excursions. Also by having a primary and a secondary seal, along with a leak check port, a better ambient leak check could have been performed. The leak check port would have greatly increased the fidelity (smaller leak check volume) and would have allowed for the use of a helium mass spectrometer, which can detect small leaks. On all GH2 leak anomalies, an ambient leak check of the system was performed, and no leakage was observed until cryogenic loading on launch day. The ambient leak check could verify only that the system didn\u2019t exhibit extreme misalignment\u2014it wasn\u2019t a good metric to determine if the installation was acceptable for cryogenic loading.","Lesson ID":6036}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"From the Astro E-2 MIB: NASA and ISAS did not develop a common approach to project management, joint mission level reviews with shared understanding of those reviews, configuration management, interface control documents, systems integration, and project management standards. The Suzaku team failed to create a mission-level review process that allowed the full participation of both partners, partly due to language and cultural barriers (as is Japanese tradition missions are renamed upon launch). Design reviews were primarily conducted in Japanese; GSFC had no in-plant representative; the provisions of a Letter of Agreement (LOA) were not implemented; and of the seven ICDs generated only two were approved and the approval signatories were all GSFC personnel, Japanese concurrence was never documented. The board also believed that the \u201cbuild to print\u201d approach compromised the collaborations, as well as the design review process for Astro E-2. The reviews were neither thorough nor incisive, perhaps due to the assumed success of Astro E.

Mission-level reviews were conducted in Japanese, with the exception of GSFC-specific portions. The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) Critical Design Review had no NASA participants and the JAXA\/ISAS major reliability review (called Soutenken) had no NASA participation. No joint systems, subsystem, test, or operations engineering working groups were put in place. NASA was not involved in mission-level Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). ISAS and GSFC did not adequately plan and rehearse mission operations. Specifically, The Suzaku team departed from normal practices in that mission-critical operations\u2014for example, the irreversible opening of the He and Ne vents and valve V12), and the (planned) opening of the aperture gate valve\u2014were performed for the first time in flight with little rehearsal or analysis. The Board could find no evidence that the ISAS\/GSFC team conducted any operations contingency planning. When planning any mission a cohesive, coherent, and effective approach should be implemented and communicated to all of the parties involved. Organizational responsibilities and interfaces need to be defined and maintained throughout the project\u2019s life cycle. This is particularly true for International missions where there are inherent geographic, cultural and communication barriers and ITAR requirements that must be overcome. Many GSFC-managed projects\/organizations built by domestic contractors station project personnel in-house to monitor the build\/integration. Astro E-2 chose not to place personnel in-house for the integration in Japan.","Lesson ID":5776}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Parts and maintenance costs on proprietary elevators are substantially higher than for nonproprietary systems. On occasion, procurements fail to specify nonproprietary elevators. In those instances, contractors sometimes bid proprietary installations. Because proprietary elevators are more expensive to install and maintain and because proprietary designs are not required at KSC, all future elevator installations should be nonproprietary.","Lesson ID":4019}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The VAB\u2019s high-bay elevators were upgraded from generator-controlled to DC-drive-controlled elevators. The new units use encoders on the motors to determine the speed and position of the elevator in the hoistway. The position encoder feeds data to the programmable logic controller (PLC) about its location. When the elevator was signaled to stop during the slide test, the PLC caused the drive to start decelerating to what is termed the approach speed. It seemed the PLC was sensing a more abrupt change than was actually occurring. This effect brought the elevator to a stop sooner than intended. Adjustments to the procedure eliminated the unintended deceleration. Since then, every elevator's 5-year safety slide test has performed within allowable scope.","Lesson ID":4021}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The operation could be performed more easily and successfully if a swivel mechanism were interposed between the end of the flexhose and the GHC. This would enable the GHC to be more easily rotated and twisted so that it could be mated with the AHC without the need to rotate and twist the remainder of the flexhose. This would save time and effort by making it easier to achieve a firm mate between the GHC and AHC on the first attempt.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Lab coats or ESD smocks with metal fasteners on the sleeves pose a short circuit risk to powered flight hardware, and possibly pose a risk to personnel safety. Garments with elastic sleeve closures provide no inadvertent conductive path, and they also reduce the likelihood of skin exposure that could contaminate sensitive equipment. ESD wristbands, sleeve covers, and gloves are compatible with either garment.","Lesson ID":5756}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Implementing remote-controlled pressure regulators and digital pressure gauges in the designs of new systems would improve launch processing in future programs because they would prevent launch delays and provide for safer operations. With the capability to adjust pressures remotely, crews would not have to be sent into the field during hazardous operations. With digital pressure gauges, differences between local and remote pressure readings would be eliminated, and there would be no need to reconcile the differences.","Lesson ID":4476}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"For complex fluid systems that contain many components, an overall system leak test can be used in lieu of individual component internal leak checks to validate the integrity of the system. This type of leak test typically involves pressurizing the system, configuring its fluid components to lock up pressure in all or part of the system, and then monitoring for a decay in pressure. Total overall leakage from the system can be calculated using the system volume and measured decay rate. For systems with multiple components in series, more than one test may be required to validate the entire system. A system-level decay test typically is less intrusive than multiple component-level leak checks; and in most cases, the allowable decay for the system can be established so that the decay test would fail if a major component has more internal leakage than is allowable. In addition to saving time and resources, this type of test offers the benefit of detecting gross external leakage from a damaged component such a cracked line or ruptured flex hose. A system-level decay test acts as a good integrity check that the system is ready for use. A system-level decay test is typically not meant to replace component-level leak checks performed to test a replaced component; however, if the component-level check is not possible or practical, the system-level leak check may give adequate confidence that the system is functioning properly. If the system-level leak check detects an anomaly, further testing could isolate the leakage to an individual component.","Lesson ID":4477}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The equipment originally used for deaeration of hydraulic fluid was not adequate to meet the requirement to keep the proportion of dissolved air in the Orbiter\u2019s hydraulic fluid below 1 volume percent. This equipment had to be modified while launch processing operations were underway in order to keep the mission on schedule. An improved system for continuous, rapid deaeration of hydraulic oil was subsequently developed. Equipment should be tested to verify that it can perform its required functions before it is used in an operational program.","Lesson ID":4596}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"A good database would help to avoid stalemates and hyperconservatism in decision making when changes to vehicle or GSE configurations are being considered, or when solving problems. A math model designed and populated as the program evolves would also help to define problems more precisely and generate better focused solutions. Proposed changes would be less risky and more efficient. A system adequately instrumented with lower-cost (and, where possible, noninvasive) maintenance parameters, in addition to flight-critical vehicle and GSE measurements, would provide data with enough depth to be of real value in evaluating system performance. It would also provide a source of data for continuous improvement of complex math models and more realistic ground simulations.","Lesson ID":4216}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When solving problems related to a space launch vehicle\u2019s subsystems, or when considering the effects of potential safety or efficiency improvements to flight or ground support equipment (GSE) configurations, having information on system performance on hand can reduce the need for expensive and time-consuming testing or modeling, can reduce the number of assumptions made, and can result in a more refined approach to the resolution of a problem, or a change in the design. Risk\/trade assessments based on real data (rather than engineering decisions based on worst-case assumptions) are more accurate and realistic and can provide management with a decision-making tool they can have confidence in.","Lesson ID":4217}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"It took several months for the processing and design teams to develop effective working relationships. A core team should have been established for each system to define roles and responsibilities, build working relationships, and establish points of contact for the design and ground processing organizations. The core team needs to include the people who will actually perform the tasks. Failure to form a core team until late in the process negatively affected ground processing. The value of the early establishment of a core team increases with the number of organizations involved, especially when they are in different locations.","Lesson ID":3758}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Initial testing of RF avionics should be performed both at its element level and the integrated vehicle level. The C&T Station provides a controlled environment for RF test equipment that interfaces with flight hardware. To ensure repeatability of test data, a controlled test facility is highly desirable, as opposed to dragging test equipment from location to location, which increases the potential for damage to both test equipment and flight hardware.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The CCC, as originally designed, could be installed only one way. The redesign, which eliminated two off-center ports, allowed the CCC to be installed backward. The only design criteria levied at the time for a correct installation was quotCorrectly orient flight CCC, such that the identification tag is visible when installed.quot Since this check did not limit the physical installation of the CCC, it could still be inadvertently installed backward. A change to the redesign was suggested, but because of the cost of any redesign to the EMU system, it was decided to add another check and a Caution note to the installation process. Since these changes were implemented, this CCC reverse installation has not recurred.","Lesson ID":3697}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The contractors who install or perform upgrades to elevators near a launch vehicle must install robust fixtures that can withstand the launch environment.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Numerous significant deficiencies were detected and addressed using the RSA system. The system was developed in a USA\/Boeing\/NASA collaborative effort and provides a simple Web-based method for technicians, inspectors, and systems engineers to quickly identify problems with the specification or to quickly suggest ways the specification could be improved. The RSA system was developed with input fields that ask the initiator to provide a problem description as well as his\/her suggested possible solution. The RSA is automatically assigned a tracking number and reviewed by an engineering team of system specialists that includes USA\/Boeing and NASA. Any RSAs that have the potential to affect the safety of the vehicle or personnel are immediately elevated and further documentation initiated. Process enhancements are evaluated by the team and specification changes are coordinated and implemented. This system has been highly effective in identifying and correcting specification deficiencies, as well as in incorporating specification and design improvements.","Lesson ID":3277}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Engineering overview, numerous quality inspectors, trained technicians, and robust work documents have been unable to eliminate damage due to removal and replacement of coldplates. Vehicle coldplates made of aluminum are more susceptible to damage during removal and replacement of LRUs than those made of stainless steel.","Lesson ID":3696}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Automated procedures using the existing LPS led to improvements in quality, safety, and operating cost. Development of automated sequencers allowed for automatic monitoring of instrumentation with a planned automatic securing and safing response. Using a computer system with fewer limitations and greater capability (such as programmable logic controllers, or PLCs) than the Shuttle program\u2019s LPS would allow for a better, more detailed automated process. Stops for exceptions could be programmed to provide planned actions for the operator. (For example, more information from the knowledge base and responses to anomalies could be built into the process.) This would reduce real-time documentation and the need to process paperwork for deviations. The test team would be able to confirm the event and immediately take corrective action if necessary. Figure 1: Typical Display Automated hypergolic servicing during Space Shuttle ground operations demonstrated how effective management and use of technological change can improve reliability and reduce operating cost in manned space flight programs, which have unique reliability and redundancy demands. Although the LPS could not be adapted to changing computer technologies, which put limitations on its automated sequencer capabilities, advances were made throughout the program. Figure 2: Typical Sequencer Menu Figure 3: Typical Sequencer Highly trained operators are critical in manned space flight, because automation does not eliminate all risks, and the operation of fast-moving automated sequencers can lull a team into a false sense of security. Operators need detailed knowledge of the hardware, software, and task objectives in order to resolve and mitigate the effects of real-time anomalies. Continual training of the operators was key to the success of Space Shuttle automated servicing success. Training using a high-fidelity math model was mandatory for operator certification.","Lesson ID":3698}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Though high-density connectors offer many design benefits, they present significant challenges for vehicle processing and anomaly resolution. They are more susceptible to damage than low-density connectors and carry significant retesting requirements if they are demated. High-density connectors should be used sparingly, and whenever possible, systems should not share a connector.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"GLMS lacked adequate design requirements. In some cases, requirements were written to the operation specifications of hardware that had already been purchased. Hardware was deployed before the system operation was fully understood. System functions were still being tested and undergoing design changes during attempts to certify the system for critical use. GMLS failed to satisfy the requirements of a critical system and did not provide data that could be completely understood or accepted without question.","Lesson ID":3640}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Accurate drawings are essential for ensuring the fit, form, and function of the thermal blankets on the RMS. Manufacturing from inaccurate drawings caused a shortage of thermal blankets and forced KSC Engineering to repair old blankets and have them approved by a material review board instead of using the new blankets.","Lesson ID":3656}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The main lesson is a lack of adequate independent reviews for the test plan, procedure, and operation. The NASA and contractor test team members did not seek an outside, independent review of a test that was clearly beyond their expertise and experience. An independent review by other disciplines would have likely pointed out important aspects to consider and overcome the group-think and schedule pressure that were factors in many of the decisions made. This mishap would have been avoided had procedures\/requirements been followed. When testing a Composite Pressure Vessel (CPV) tank above Maximum Expected Operating Pressure (MEOP), and with limited expertise\/knowledge of CPV, an abundance of caution should have been employed. The involvement of Safety and Mission Assurance functions, various NASA discipline consultations, the performance of risk assessments, and the completion of variance documentation, would have triggered the right questions and analyses, thereby avoiding the mishap. Management review and insight for testing and risk analysis was inadequate. Figure 1: Location of test personnel Figure 2: Plywood Barrier","Lesson ID":5396}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Changes in ambient temperature cause the control pressure to change, which requires frequent readjustment to the regulators.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Considering the scale, proximity, and ferocity (Figures 4 and 5) of the Station Fire, JPL came out with only minor damage. This was due to planning and effective leadership by JPL, but also due to external factors such as the massive state\/local response, fortuitous timing, and the absence of strong winds. Figures 4 & 5. Areas of heavy vegetation that had not seen significant fires in 40 years, combined with steep slopes and extreme weather (triple-digit temperature and low humidity), resulted in flames that reached 100 feet in height. Because JPL is located in an area that is prone to natural disasters, and because disruptions to NASA Center operations pose a threat to very high value national assets, JPL must be particularly well prepared for emergencies that arise with little warning. An appropriately staffed and supported incident command center is a key element of any incident response system. Effective communications with employees is also very important in a facility that houses 5,000 personnel and has limited major egress roads.","Lesson ID":5256}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"NiH2 CPV battery cell designs are susceptible to a unique electrolyte bridging between the two internal cells that can potentially result in undesired ionic current flow, which can ultimately deplete the capacity within one of the two cells. The internal design configuration of a normal CPV allows free material transport between cells as both cells within a CPV are intended to share the hydrogen gas necessary for NiH2 cell functionality. Two conditions were identified where it is possible for free potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte to creep between the cell stacks and to establish an undesirable conductive ionic pathway that effectively shorts out one of the two cells within the CPV. Those conditions are: 1) activating the NiH2 CPV cells with excess electrolyte present or 2) allowing the cells to reach very low states of charge during operation. Based on observations and available data, once the electrolyte bridge is established there are no effective means to eliminate the problem with the possible exception of fully reconditioning the battery cell, or at least extended operation (up to a few weeks) in an open circuit condition.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Tiger team developed and implemented a number of preventative and mitigating design changes. The original ceramic packing material degraded over time. The design was updated to eliminate ceramic saddles and install more stable polypropylene spherical packing. Sulzar-structured packing was replaced with polypropylene flexipac. Vent screens were welded into the vent path to prevent the migration of packing material that could block piping, resulting in subsequent buildup of back pressure. At high-flow rates, the citric acid could foam up. With sufficient foaming, the liquor bubbles were able to rise to the top of the vent stacks and into the environment. A food-grade antifoaming agent was added to the scrubber liquor. After field testing, the original food-grade antifoaming agent was replaced with an industrial-grade agent. A test for foam formation that is performed on a periodic basis was implemented to check the effectiveness of the antifoaming agent. A back pressure alarm was added to the remote operations software that will alert the operator when there is a buildup of pressure that is below the level of pressure that can result in a \u201cburp\u201d. Secondary containment was installed where necessary around the base of the vent stack to protect the environment in the event of an unexpected release. The vent stack cap was redesigned with the use of a screen to keep wildlife and debris out and to restrict the dispersion of foam\/spray in the event of an unexpected release. The citric acid was required to be mixed from dry powder, within 24 hours of delivery, to minimize bacteria growth.","Lesson ID":3596}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The IDC was not designed or fabricated in accordance with the following NASA design requirements: NSTS 07700, Volume X; SW-E-0002; KSC-STD-E-0002E; and KSC-E-165E. The IDC purge components were not designed to prevent overpressurization, which caused system failure. Instead of a Bepco enclosure pressure control valve, a Bepco control panel rapid-exchange valve was used to control GN2 system purge. This allowed the rapid release of overpressure, which in turn caused the system to fail. The IDC single-stage regulator was found to have vibrated open, causing the inlet pressure to increase (creep) to 50 psi. The nominal operational pressure setting is 10 psi. This increase in the inlet pressure setting allowed the system to become overpressurized and caused the system to fail. The IDC camera head enclosure lid was not sealed properly because of ground wire interference, which caused a differential in system pressure between enclosures. The bottom clip on the IDC camera battery, power supply, and power supply enclosure were seated but did not catch the enclosure door, which contributed to system purge leakage. NASA lab personnel completed measurement testing before the ICD was put into operational use. However, purge system operation and functional checkout were not performed, which prevented detection of system overpressurization before operational use. The current operational procedure, MDA Prototype Ice Detection Camera User Manual Rev 4.0, was not followed. Use of that operational procedure might have prevented the system overpressurization. A new local procedure for field use will be developed containing all operational steps, notes, cautions, and warnings. The procedure will include a section requiring that such equipment undergo purge and functional checkout in a NASA lab before use in the field. All operators will be trained on the use of the new procedure and the IDC.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The primary lessons learned from this experience are that improper vetting and subsequent monitoring of a contractor can lead to numerous and significant issues later. The second contractor was selected by the first contractor and the visibility to both NASA and USA was extremely limited from the very beginning. After the initial contract was cancelled and the production contract for HIMs (which are the system that the HPAs supported) was awarded to a third company, their position was that this was a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) item to them since NASA directed them to use this LRU. It was only after the quality and workmanship issues became known (and the subsequent IG investigation) that the numerous issues with the HPA would have to be addressed. The inaccuracy of the drawings and inconsistency with respect to the workmanship within the HPAs were merely symptoms of the overall problems with the processes at the second contractor.","Lesson ID":3041}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Manual methods for management of software requirements are ineffective and inefficient, contributing to excessive costs as well as schedule delays. Aspects of the management of software requirements include the elicitation\/specification, analysis, development, tracking, and changing of software requirements used during the implementation and sustaining phases of the software life cycle. Management and traceability of software requirements are critical to the success of producing reliable, high-quality, and safe software products that meet end-users requirements and needs in a cost-effective and timely fashion. Cost and schedule impacts that result from incomplete, incorrect, or changing software requirements increase the later they occur in the software life cycle. Current software technology, processes, and tools provide innovative automated methods to facilitate optimum management of software requirements (e.g., IBM Rational DOORS, IBM Rational RequisitePro, Cradle requirements management software). Additionally, a collaborative relationship between the customer using the software and the developer providing the software is paramount to the success of the software project. More specifically, the users\/customers must effectively define and accurately communicate their requirements to the developer. For example, the user\u2019s defined requirements should be clearly stated and unambiguous, concise, complete, autonomous, able to be implemented, and testable.","Lesson ID":3377}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Based on the STS-83 experience, adequate health status information for critical systems must be provided for worst-case scenario resolutions. In the case of the Orbiter fuel cells, it was determined that individual cell health status is mandatory to preclude premature mission termination. It should be noted that attempts had been made prior to FCMS to develop, qualify, and certify single-cell health monitoring. Previous attempts were considered too costly. In light of the failure and the added cost to re-fly the STS-83 mission, the prudent choice should have been to implement a design enhancement sooner.","Lesson ID":3339}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Charging a lead-acid battery produces hydrogen and oxygen gasses which creates pressure inside the battery. Battery explosions can occur and have been reported in industry. One conclusion is when one or more cells have a high concentration of hydrogen gas because the vent cap was plugged or defective and did not release the gas effectively an unsafe condition is created. In addition, when electrolyte levels fall below the top of the plates, a low resistive bridge can form at the top of the plates and when current starts to flow, it can cause an arc or spark in one of the cells to intensify that condition. This combination of events ignites the gas, blows the battery case cover off and spatters electrolyte with potentially injuring unaware personnel and to further damage associated equipment.","Lesson ID":2876}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The potential hazards of battery testing and storage suggest that the handling of batteries undergoing research and development should meet safety standards similar to those governing handling of flight batteries. There may be other hazardous research and development testing at JPL where test personnel are not aware of, or not trained in, the assessment of safety risks. The battery test was a research and development activity and not the flight hardware validation that is explicitly governed by Reference (4). Battery fires are not unusual occurrences, as batteries are sometimes tested to failure. However, the hazardous battery test procedures that led to the incident did not have adequate fault protection controls. The fire alarm triggered the evacuation of the office building. Combustion products from the battery fire in the bunker entered the ventilation intakes for the upper floors of the office building. In addition to facility lessons learned, the incident suggests test configuration improvements for implementation by flight projects that wish to use similar Li-ion batteries.","Lesson ID":3516}

Fatigue or wear during a previous flight or damage during ground processing could result in leakage from a component that was not leak-checked, or that was leak-checked before the damage occurred.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"It would have been beneficial to capture the end-user\u2019s requirements prior to the design phase. GMS encountered several roadblocks and the need for major design changes during attempts to implement the system. One component of the system, which required many work hours of troubleshooting, never attained full functionality. In addition, one of the advertised benefits of GMS was the ability to locate the signal conditioning and amplifier circuitry near the transducer or measurement device, but this scheme was also fraught with problems and proved extremely hard to implement in the launch environment. Another weakness observed was the lack of continuing support. In this case, designers were involved in several projects and had limited resources available to assist after the system had been turned over to the end user. This problem could have been avoided by using a COTS system.","Lesson ID":2956}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The event described above is only one recent example of several GHe leak events that have occurred over the duration of the Shuttle program. Some of the known leak incidences have cost as much as $200,000 for a single event. Over the long term of a program, significant savings could be achieved by better detection of gas leakages.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The discrepancies noted during return-to-flight processing included difficulty in producing a legible ID with rubber stamps and ink; illegible part\/serial\/order control numbers; human error in reading part\/serial\/order control numbers whether legible or not; and human error in transcribing part\/serial\/order control numbers onto paperwork. Other problems were noted, including time-consuming efforts in inventory control and reporting functions; mundane repetitive accountability procedures; the need for more stringent requirements for accuracy and quality control; and problems with configuration control and documentation control. The lesson learned from this experience was that entering data by visual observation and handwritten entries produced numerous errors; but by bar-coding parts, a database can be built and used for easy processing of thousands of parts. Travelers can be printed with preloaded information from the database in lieu of making visual observations and hand entries. Some advantages gained from bar coding and tracking were; Reduced cost (fewer installation mistakes per configuration and fewer installation man-hours) Improved accountability of hardware from removal through installation during processing (better logistic accountability and elimination of delays for configuration verification) Improved installation of parts (for multiple items) by bar-coding the part and its location with the same bar code number Improved efficiency \u2013 rather than being retrieved from a random handwritten log, with the Parts To Go function, parts can be retrieved from a sorted list (arranged by vehicle zone, installation drawing, or any manner the technician might choose) Reduced need for paperwork to correct configuration discrepancies (errors in entering, reading, or transcribing part\/serial\/order control numbers) Reduced human error (in installation, reading ID labels, location, storage, and typographical errors) Use of common software to support both the TCS tracking system and Carrier Panel Tracking System.","Lesson ID":3016}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Wire IDs were used in the Space Shuttle Program and were an important part of the Orbiter processing. The wire IDs aided in wire repairs, functional retest, and system fault isolation. The schedule impacts of not installing wire IDs were evident in the ARES I-X Program. Future Space Flight Programs should use wire identification as part of their wire harness fabrication process, or the initial build installation and ground flight processing will be impacted. One example of the value of wire harness IDs in the Shuttle Program is the ability to determine the wire function using only the wire ID. A worst-case scenario is wire damage detected during final closeouts, and when post repair requires a functional retest. If the function is unknown, there are two ways to resolve this condition: perform extensive hardware removals to isolate the wire function or perform functional retest of all wires in the harness. A complete functional retest of all the wires in the harness may not be possible if it contains functions that cannot be retested in the vertical configuration. In this case, it would cause flight hardware removals to isolate the function. The removal of flight hardware in final closeouts would likely drive a slip in the planned launch date. Depending on the vehicle design, this issue could result in the de-stack of the vehicle. The Orbiter has experienced many cases of wire damage just prior to flight, and wire IDs were invaluable in resolving the issues quickly without impacting the planned launch date.","Lesson ID":2917}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Requiring such tight rigging tolerances on the mechanical components created several problems and made the process of rigging the mechanisms very complex. The team decided that the best way to determine the on-center position of the linkage was by monitoring the load in the drive rod. Theoretically, the load should peak at the on-center position. In order to measure this so that the stop could be set within the required 0.002 inch tolerance, a linear transducer was installed on the drive bellcrank, and strain gauges were attached to the drive rod. Testing on the flight hardware showed that because of friction and other inconsistencies, the location of the peak load varied depending on the speed at which the linkage was cycled and the direction (stow or deploy). The team eventually decided that the on-center position would be based on an average of the positions of the stow and deploy peak loads, weighted toward the stow position. However, the amount of variability in this measurement resulted in some risk that the stop bolt position would not be set within the required range. The design of the hardware should not require this level of accuracy to ensure proper operation. Additionally, the team found that other seemingly minor things had an effect on the performance of the mechanism. It was discovered that the way the pedestal assembly was attached to the test stand made enough of a difference that it caused it to exceed some of the spec limits. This was because of minor deflections in the base plate of the assembly because of how it was secured to the stand. Also, such tight rigging requirements make the system more susceptible to problems in flight. During ground checkout it is not possible to simulate all the conditions the hardware will experience on-orbit. The effects of zero-G and thermal changes cannot be screened for on the ground. During the first few flights after the modified MPM hardware was installed, there were some problems with the performance of the limit switches. Even during prelaunch operations at the pad we found that the limit switches transferred differently than they did during horizontal processing in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). In flight, some of the limit switch indications did not come on during the cycles but then transferred on some time later. These were believed to be because of thermal effects on orbit. Eventually the specification was updated, and the limit switch rigging was relaxed to account for these issues.","Lesson ID":2837}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"GUCP recertification was based on changes made to the GUCP only and did not include the interactions with the ground shroud. No functional testing was performed with the new GUCP QD configuration with the ice suppression shroud. The GUCP QD modifications did not undergo a complete system-level test because the modifications were deemed passive and there was no change in form\/fit\/function, despite significant changes in the QD: going from a two-piece casting to a one-piece casting with significantly more surface area. Analysis and thermal models of the component failed to predict the effect in operational conditions. Also, the purge shroud was not adequately investigated during initial conception and testing to determine when gases would begin to mix and nitrogen purge could begin to intrude upon cryogenically chilled surfaces. The inadequately tested modifications to the GUCP QD and the lack of close observation of vapor drips from the ice suppression shroud nearly caused the launch of STS-114 to be aborted.","Lesson ID":2856}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"There were no requirements to verify the seal compression. Proper compression was assumed based on meeting the door-to-structure flushness requirement. There was also no requirement to verify the height of the seals. There was a postflight visual inspection only. Attempts to adjust the mechanism to obtain the proper seal compression and door position confirmed that the mechanism was not capable of overcoming the loads of the seals and other soft goods without exceeding other parameters of the rigging specification. Ultimately, some parts of the mechanism were instrumented to ensure that the loads in the critical components remained within acceptable limits. In addition, after the STS-114 rerigging effort was complete, small changes in seal or thermal-barrier stiffness (when components were replaced) resulted in unacceptable changes in the door positions. This often resulted in extensive testing and rework in subsequent flows. There were similar problems with other orbiter mechanical systems, including the ingress\/egress hatch and External Tank umbilical doors. Furthermore, when the system was reworked in the field, it was not always possible to comply with the mechanical rigging specifications. The specs were written from a manufacturing perspective, and often the seals and other Thermal Protection System components were not installed. Following the spec in the field was not always practical because it required that the hardware be returned to the original build configuration. This resulted in partial compliance with the specs and the need for material reviews to document deviations from the spec or out-of-spec conditions.","Lesson ID":2838}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The torque limiters of the External Tank door actuators were redesigned in the early 1990s because of unacceptable degradation of the disk friction surfaces. The new design was a multidisk ball-ramp setup. When the torque reached a certain value, the ball-ramp design reduced the compression load on the disk stack and allowed the disks to rotate relative to each other (slip). The disks in this particular actuator were made of steel and Vespel. After several years of service with the new torque limiter design, most of the actuators exhibited reduced torque output. Investigation determined that the torque limiter degradation was due to grease contamination of the disk surfaces. Inspection confirmed that excess grease was applied to some of the torque limiter components (bearings) during assembly and eventually migrated to the disk surfaces. However, even after the actuators were refurbished, excess grease was removed, and the grease was cleaned from the disks, the actuators often continued to exhibit torque degradation and show evidence of grease contamination of the disks. Another problem was the amount of effort required to set the torque limiter to slip in the required range when the actuator was being serviced. The value at which the torque limiter slips depends somewhat on the temperature, and the actuator is required to operate with a specified torque output through a large temperature range (over 300 \u00b0F). Several rounds of adjustments were needed, each followed by days of testing. In addition, there was degradation of the motor clutch\/brake assemblies in these actuators. Each actuator has two AC motors, each of which interfaces with the gear box differential through a clutch\/brake assembly. For redundancy, the actuator will operate on only one motor. When a motor is not operating, the clutch\/brake assembly is in the brake mode. A friction disk is spring-loaded against a stator, which locks the input to the differential and disconnects it from the motor. This is necessary so that during single-motor operation, the nonoperating motor input is not back-driven through the differential. When the motor starts up, the assembly switches to clutch mode. A solenoid pulls the disk away from the stator, separating the brake surfaces and engaging the clutch surface of the disk to the motor output. The motor then drives the differential input through the clutch. During tests of the actuators on the vehicle, the torque output varied significantly by motor mode. Since there is a single torque limiter, the point at which it slips should be the same regardless of which motor is operating. This indicated that the clutch\/brake assembly was slipping prematurely. Disassembly and inspection confirmed that both the clutch and brake surfaces were worn. There was evidence of scoring on the interfacing surfaces and metallic debris in the assembly.","Lesson ID":2839}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"To reject varying spacecraft heat loads prior to launch, circulate a primary loop single-phase refrigerant through the spacecraft-to-ground heat exchanger while maintaining a constant heat load via a heater on a secondary ground loop to a tertiary two-phase refrigeration loop because that makes a more stable and reliable system for ground-cooling equipment than the previously used variable-load system.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The sole decision criterion for excessing items was usage rate. The computerized logistics system documented the holding fixtures as not being in use. They had no usage history. The individuals involved in the excessing process believed that they were only excessing holding fixtures. As a result, the Structural\/Mechanical Subsystem Manager was put on routing for concurrence or non-concurrence with final excess disposition, rather than the owner - the Electrical Power System Subsystem Manager. The individual who entered the holding fixtures into the computerized logistics system entered the holding fixtures as separate items from the PWM CCAs, because the system lacked the capability to document and track integrated components. Further, the holding fixture drawing did not identify its purpose or reference the PWM CCAs. Neither individual who performed physical verification of the containers realized flight hardware was in them. Note: The verifications were performed by individuals at the beginning and end of the excess process. Unfortunately, the flight parts tags were not placed on the containers in a conspicuous manner, and were NOT noticed by the individuals performing the verifications. However, asset identification numbers, (used for non-flight items like holding fixtures) were prominently displayed on the outside of the containers and were most likely used for identification.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Some common lessons learned deduced from the various root causes of the studied incidents are shown in the following list. If these items were properly addressed prior to the incidents, prevention may have been possible (in hindsight) or the ramifications of the incident could have been reduced. Improper configuration control and internal or external human performance shaping factors can lead to a false comfort level . Vent systems are often neglected and treated as non-hazardous even though they can capture and contain condensed hypergolic liquids (especially in low points) . Aging support hardware should be routinely inspected to reduce the risk of a failure during critical operations. Communication breakdown can escalate an incident to a level where injuries occur or hardware is damaged Communication protocols should be pre-coordinated prior to an operation Improper propulsion system and ground support system designs can destine a system for failure Every effort should be made to design out low points in GSE Unknown incompatibilities (from lack of training or research) with propellants can cause surprising failures Improper training of technicians, engineers, and safety personnel can put lives in danger Inadequate knowledge of potential electrostatic discharge hazards while working fuel operations can lead to a fire or explosion Knowledge of instrumentation error and\/or offsets are very important for system oversight Improper personal protective equipment, spill protection, and staging of fire extinguishing equipment can result in unnecessary injuries or hardware damage if an incident occurs Improper procedural oversight (along with the development of and adherence to the procedure) can be detrimental and quickly lead to an incident Improper emergency procedures can increase the risk of injuries or hardware damage Improper local cleanliness or housekeeping (for example iron oxide or rust) can result in fires or explosions A thorough hypergol system evacuation should be completed (wherever a vacuum is tolerable by the system) prior to the removal or disconnection of any hypergolic propellant fittings A pulse purge using an inert gas has proven to be inadequate for residual propellant removal Advance warning of an incident appears approximately 50% of the time (according to the data presented); therefore, personnel supporting a hypergol operation should be cognizant of any system fluctuations and be prepared to execute safing procedures if the need arises A heightened amount of situational awareness of technicians and engineers working operations can reduce the risk of an incident and decrease the possibility of injuries or damage if an incident does occur After the occurrence of an incident (or if an advance warning is observed), the system should immediately be placed into a stable configuration; following this, the procedure should be stopped to assess the problem and its possible ramifications","Lesson ID":2196}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When tests were performed to determine why newly installed chiller coils were corroding, there were signs that the copper coils had not been cleaned properly before being coated. The coating itself was fine, but there was flaking because the coating did not stick. Because of the environmental restrictions at VAFB, the parties involved decided to ship the coils back to the coating factory in Bakersfield, CA, where they would be cleaned and coated again without being completely removed from the chiller unit. The cleaning process proved to be too acidic and was halted. The unit was sent back to the site and reinstalled until further investigation could be done on the coils. The manufacturer of the chiller units investigated its coil supplier and found that they had begun using a new supplier who used a silicone release agent that was not properly removed by the acid bath. This was the reason the coating did not adhere properly. New coils were manufactured, and the proper release agent was used. The new coils were cleaned and coated in accordance with the specifications. The original coils were removed, and the new coils installed onsite.

This redacted lesson learned discusses the benefits of alternative methods of thermal stress analysis for bonded joints. This 4th redacted lesson learned provides guidelines for design and test of test coupons.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Engineers and scientists often don't realize the downstream complexity (and cost) that result from their local decisions. Overly stringent requirements and simplistic hardware interfaces can complicate software; FSW descope decisions and ill-conceived autonomy can complicate operations; and inattention to testability can complicate verification efforts. Unsubstantiated requirements have caused unnecessary FSW complexity where the requirement was either unnecessary or overly stringent. Rationale statements have often been omitted or misused in spite of a best practice that calls for a rationale for every requirement. Reference (4) places great emphasis on the need to provide rationales. Although overall complexity can be reduced through engineering trade studies involving multiple stakeholders (e.g., flight, ground, hardware, software, testing, operations), Reference (3) found that trade studies were often omitted or performed superficially. Good software architecture is the most important defense against incidental complexity in software designs, but good architecting skills are not common. A decision is often made not to implement a FSW function, or not to fix a FSW defect, principally because an operational workaround is feasible. This practice transfers complexity from FSW to mission operations where it is a continuing cost rather than a one-time cost and where it increases the risk of an operational error. Fault management (aka fault protection) software is among the most difficult FSW to specify, design, and test. Other fault management problems (Reference (5)) include inconsistent fault management terminology used by NASA centers and their contractors, mismatches between mission requirements and the fault management approach, and lack of attention to fault management in university curricula. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software can provide valuable functionality, but it often comes with unneeded features that interact with other features and complicate testing. Because software development can generate at least 1 defect per 10,000 LOC, FSW with 1 million LOC will have 100 defects, some of which will likely manifest during mission operations. Mature software may contain latent defects that may manifest in new applications.","Lesson ID":2050}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Test data analysis indicated that the two major causes for the thermal runaway are over voltage (overcharge) and external short conditions. In these cases, the internal protective devices were either not protecting as expected or were a cause for the hazards encountered. PTC ignition above its withstanding (threshold) voltage has been shown to cause thermal runaway under external short conditions in high-voltage battery modules. Thermal runaway has also been observed during overcharge conditions in high-voltage and high-capacity modules, indicating that the CIDs did not protect the cells from catastrophic events, as seen in single cells. The NESC sponsored study was conducted to understand the causes for the thermal runaway in high-voltage and high-capacity battery modules, and to determine the limitations of the cell internal protective devices.","Lesson ID":2046}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Problems such as the NAOMS risk analysis simply require the necessary time to mature the methodology and arrive at a solution. The time is required by the situation itself and is independent of schedule. We realized that premature or crude results were forced in order to meet a schedule. NASA can take the time necessary to provide a higher precision result. (To do the job correctly) The NAOMS risk analysis is an example of the dominance of schedule compliance over technical requirements. Another lesson learned was that the NAOMS risk team should have challenged the project management to a far greater degree about the schedule issue. We learned an important insight in the course of the project. The probabilities for each of the enabling events in the success-tree had a substantial amount of uncertainty. ( ie. wide ranges) This is due to the fact that any of the input variables for models to estimate those probabilities would have large uncertainties. In retrospect, our use of advanced statistical methods and computational techniques only provided answers which, in the end, are nothing more than rough approximations. They could have been obtained by simple expert opinion.","Lesson ID":2017}

Application of these standards to spacecraft systems without the preparation and review of appropriate guidance may pose an unacceptable and unnecessary risk to mission success. The deregulation of industry by elimination or relaxation of government standards and specs for the procurement of qualified materials, processes, and products (formerly audited and enforced by entities such as Defense Contract Administration Services (DCAS)), has further increased the risk that even products known to be acceptable will not perform as expected.","Lesson ID":1997}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"1. Use of an all-inclusive steering committee of all the stakeholders was an outstanding asset to the execution of the program. Being all inclusive meant all voices were heard, and even when unanimous decisions were not reachable, consensus was achieved, which maintained long term viability of the program and the project. Frequent communication was essential for this to happen within the steering committee. 2. Insufficient systems approach to the facilities, equipment, and planning occurred. Despite having extensive experience within the team with systems engineering, insufficient excess capacity was designed into the system because the entire lifecycle was not understood at inception. Requirements creep resulted in taking additional time, effort, and energy to incorporate research which was not mature at the start of the design. 3. Careful attention to risk management, both programmatic and technical, was a valuable asset in every phase of the program. In particular, sensitivity to the aircraft systems was paramount. 3a. In one instance, the aircraft's flight control computers failed to pass the Built-In Test on several occasions during the Day-of-Flight checks before passing the Built-In Test. As the pilot and crew continued the preparation for flight, several engineers in the control room stopped, took stock of the situation, and decided to cancel the mission until the reason for the failures was understood for the aircraft not passing the Built-In Test. 3b. In another instance, the Spin Recovery System (spin parachute) was reinstalled on the aircraft. The convention at that time was to fire the chute system from a benign flight condition as a system test. In most spin parachute systems, there is a small (but finite) potential for loss of the aircraft if the chute cannot be jettisoned. In the case of the F-18 HARV, the project team decided to fire the chute on the ground in a high-speed taxi test only (this was done twice) and to NOT fire the system in-flight as a system test. This reduced the risk exposure to the aircraft and flight crew, while still testing the system in a representative environment. It should be noted that two other high angle of attack programs decided to fire the spin parachute in-flight as a system test (X-29A and X-31A). 3c. As well as making careful estimates for improvements and changes, be sure to define, well in advance and with careful planning, the deletion of specific envelope expansion hardware (or safety hardware). This needs to be carefully coordinated as part of the continuing airworthiness and flight safety process. In the case of the F-18 HARV, after the envelope expansion was complete, the need for the spin recovery system and the emergency power systems (battery back-ups, another system that was tested and demonstrated in ground tests) could have been removed from the aircraft. A current example might be the Fight Termination System onboard a UAV, or a system augmentation of the Flight Termination System. 4. Testing, both ground and flight, always uncovers deficiencies and contingencies that need to be planned in. This is true in the integration phase, but also (and in particular with one-of-a-kind research systems) in the flight phase. One aspect of this was the use of carrying extra flight cards in the briefed cards for a mission. Even though we knew we could not achieve all the test points, excess cards were always carried. If one piece of instrumentation failed during a mission, then other cards could be substituted and a full mission could be flown. Up to 140% of a mission's cards would be carried on every mission. Having these contingencies in mind during planning is useful as well. If a particular flight control load developed unforeseen problems, a previous load (for which lower priority test points are still waiting to be flown) can be reloaded and lower priority missions continue while the unforeseen difficulties are resolved. The ground testing of the system wa greatly streamlined by the presence of the Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation residing at Dryden. The hardware simulation, being co-located with the aircraft and the research team, minimized impacts to the schedule. 5. Use of a Class B envelope for Class B software (flight control laws) is very useful. However, careful attention needs to be paid to the corners of the Class B envelope to assure that, truly, the envelope is Class B. In particular, the lower right corner (for static structural loads) and the upper right corner (for flutter), and the upper left corner (for aeroservoelastics). Class B software is quickly reconfigurable, and flexible.","Lesson ID":1604}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Mars Exploration Rover (MER) development encountered many unexpected problems that were overcome only by strong NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) support for the project. This video recording of a September 23, 2005 presentation explains how JPL was able to call upon engineering expertise as needed, and how established and effective JPL engineering processes (Reference (1)) supported their efforts. Rob Manning provides examples of these challenges that were overcome by the MER project, including: Few believed that a new Mars rover could be designed and tested in only the 3 years available to the project. Hence, the plans called for 50 percent of the launched dry mass of MER to derive from detailed designs inherited from the 1997 Mars Pathfinder design. However, design studies showed this to be impractical, and only 2 percent of the MER dry mass was actually derived from inherited designs. A typical 4-year development cycle was compressed into 3 years for a very complex and volume-constrained spacecraft. This period encompassed repetitive redesign and test cycles for the parachutes and airbags, and the addition only 18 months before launch of a capability to directly sense horizontal motion across the Martian surface (Reference (2)). A non-essential fuse blown during a test pyrotechnic firing only two months before MER launch produced an unexpected circuit condition. Consequently, it appeared that mission-critical sneak circuit paths could result from the mission sequence in which a cable-cutter severs spacecraft power bus return wires that are not electrically isolated (deadfaced). One month of intensive circuit analysis by a group of very senior engineers proved that MER could safely launch. Only 48 hours before the MER landing, an analysis of testbed data suggested an apparent timing problem with the pyrotechnic system electronics that trigger the landing events. Around-the-clock analysis over the next day confirmed a mission-critical hardware design flaw, and JPL made a risky decision to manually enable the firing of the pyros that may have saved the mission.","Lesson ID":1797}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Operational Procedures and Processes. An independent review board (Reference (2)) determined that the MGS mission team followed existing operating procedures and processes, but the rules were inadequate to detect the errors. More thorough operating procedures and processes would have avoided many of the factors contributing to this anomaly. Spacecraft Design Weaknesses. The onboard fault protection was inadequate to diagnose and correct the faults that were the likely cause of the mission loss. The spacecraft mistakenly determined that a solar array was stuck and, based on this information, initiated an attitude that was thermally unsafe for an essential battery. In addition, telemetry did not provide the ground with sufficient data on the cause of the initial fault. Lifetime Management Considerations. MGS had entered its fourth extended mission phase just prior to the anomaly. As is common during extensions to already long-lived missions, the MGS budget and staff had been reduced to economize on mission ops. While no direct evidence attributes the anomaly to these reductions, the review board judged that such reductions can inherently increase risk. Periodic reviews should have been performed to assure that spacecraft control parameters were appropriate to the current state of the spacecraft, and the risks associated with normal personnel turnover over time should also have been assessed. While the training methodology for some operations positions was excellent, the board noted that it was not uniformly applied.","Lesson ID":1805}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The ability to switch a transponder on and off, especially when a smart device replaces a fused supply, provides flexibility during spacecraft integration and test, and facilitates a mission design in which the transponder is OFF during ascent. However, the IMAGE mishap may validate the typical industry-wide practice of minimizing the risk of losing uplink telemetry by hardwiring the receiver to the power bus. Overcurrent protection of a spacecraft receiver may actually pose a mission-critical risk unless the protection device is designed to reset (in a robust and redundant manner) after transient faults in either the receiver or the overcurrent protection device itself. Had the IMAGE PDU EDAC designers known in advance about the SSPC's status reporting limitation, they could have designed the logic to prevent an unrecoverable loss of receiver power. For example, it could have imposed a transponder voltage test that closed the SSPC after an extended voltage drop. Also, NASA part anomaly alerts are typically distributed only to hardware developers; distribution to operations personnel would allow early consideration of possible mitigation action. Protection against the loss of ground commanding was needed at the flight system level. A system-level command loss fault response from the flight software in IMAGE's main computer that reached to the root level (i.e., including the SSPC) would have reset the telecom power supply SSPC as well as reasserting attitude control and other subsystem and system functions. quotCommand loss fault protectionquot typically resets its timer periodically over the course of normal operations; after the flight software loses ground commanding (for whatever reason), the fault protection will (after a period of days or months) cycle through different system configurations and options until contact is restored.","Lesson ID":1799}

The difference between the predicted versus achieved data volume returned by the MER UHF data link has sometimes impacted the daily planning of rover driving and science data collection. Although for a small number of sols this resulted in a data return less than the maximum achievable, the greatly extended MER surface mission duration has returned science data that has vastly exceeded requirements and the most optimistic early expectations.","Lesson ID":1765}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When viewed against a history of RTD failures related to mechanical stress during NASA and military missions, recent JPL failures suggest that these devices remain sensitive to variations in bond joint geometry and in device and surface mount materials. Hence, package qualification verification (PQV) may be particularly suited to predicting RTD failure -- arguably more suited than a collective mechanical design guideline for packaging (e.g., 155 deg C range for 200 cycles). The need for PQV may be overlooked in plans and contracts because hardware featuring RTDs may be mistakenly considered to be purely mechanical assemblies. Also, a problem with qualifying a single standard mounting configuration is the lack of analytical insight into what changes may invalidate the flight qualification.","Lesson ID":1739}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"1. It was clear that the UAV pilot did not know several key flight critical parameters that a pilot should know in order to execute a flight test. Chief among them were maximum landing speed and maximum flight time at cruise power. 2. The ground support crew used a complex preflight checklist and skipped a key step that reduced the thrust time rate-of-change to be less than expected by the pilot, resulting in a longer take off roll, and a re-contact with the runway during departure. 3. Steps in checklists maybe missed if the checklist is overly complex. There was no independent or second check that each step in the preflight checklist was executed. 4. The preflight checklist did not include a briefing of flight critical parameters to the pilot. The pilot was new to this UAV. 5. The pilot's lack of knowledge in a key area of engine thrust trim contributed to the pilot's perception of off nominal thrust performance during the flight. 6. The flight crew did not give the pilot real time warnings when flight critical parameters were being exceeded due to the erroneous assumption that the pilot was familiar with the parameters. 7.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"At KSC the 175- and 250-Ton Bridge Cranes in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) were using metadynes (electromechanical rotating amplifiers) for control function. The metadyne had a long history of maintenance problems because of brush wear, contamination and corrosion. It required extensive pre-operation maintenance attention to support Shuttle processing. In addition, the metadyne units often required maintenance during processing operations impacting processing schedules. KSC replaced the metadynes with solid state controller units resulting in decreased maintenance actions including pre-operation maintenance and improved system performance and availability. Fault isolation and removal and replacement of failed components is easier and less time consuming. Since failures occur at a less frequent rate, the need for numerous operating spares is reduced.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Mechanical means of cleaning\/scrubbing inside surfaces removes most particulate contamination. Vacuum baking of the individual piece parts has limited effectiveness in removing contaminants. Use of the Alcohol-based solvents for cleaning leads to deposits on the surfaces of the piece parts and also can be absorbed into the surfaces (esp. HaO insulator). The potential of contaminant deposit on the inside of the TC during acceptance testing, including operating temperature calibration, requires careful selection of cleaning agents as well as the cleaning of all parts prior to assembly and keeping all parts clean throughout the assembly and testing process. Use of alcohol-based cleaners should be avoided as they have a tendency to be absorbed into the materials and then during high temperature operations will be deposited as Carbon on all inside surfaces of the TC thus causing TC failure during ATP.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"OSP took many proactive management steps to increase our emphasis on safety. However, just below the surface significant flaws existed in our implementation approach resulting in a misunderstanding of the S&MA organizational authority. With the program acceleration, the quality of the safety products was further compromised by abandoning established requirements, processes, tools, and standards of performance. The intent was to catch up on the safety products at SDR and beyond; however, safety is most effective when woven into the fabric of all organizational elements from the start of a program. Additionally: a. S&MA Leadership. Throughout the life of the program, it appeared that OSP S&MA inclusion in management decisions and leadership was ineffective. A misunderstanding in S&MA leadership was created by the presence of a senior S&MA expert (former S&MA employee) on the Program staff, reporting to the Program Manager. His role was to ensure internal Program implementation of and compliance with S&MA requirements and provide a working level interface with the assigned independent S&MA representatives. It now appears that this arrangement somehow gave the impression of diminishing the role of the separately assigned, independent S&MA representatives. b. De-emphasizing S&MA Products. At the Systems Requirements Review (SRR), S&MA products were de-emphasized as a contract deliverable due to acceleration. These same products were not part of the formal review at the SDR for baselining (only comments were allowed); therefore, these S&MA documents did not go through a thorough review and feedback process. The \u201ccatch-up\u201d desired never materialized, and as a result, the normal safety products expected at SDR were deficient. c. S&MA Requirements. Adequate S&MA requirements were not contained in the Level 2 requirements document, and insufficient attention was paid to S&MA data requirements in the contracts. The Program placed so much emphasis on the HRR that we overlooked many, equally important S&MA requirements. d. Level 3 and Level 4 S&MA Requirements Development. Given the inadequate Level 2 S&MA requirements, the Contractors' were unable to develop appropriate Level 3 and 4 S&MA requirements. e. Incomplete Understanding. NASA should not assume the Contractor workforce understands the Government's human space flight expectations. Discipline working groups were needed to provide a forum to assure mutual understanding\/interpretation of the S&MA requirements and processes between participating NASA centers, contractors, and related stake holders. Without functioning working groups, the contractors' interpretation and implementation of S&MA requirements were questioned and debated at each program review.","Lesson ID":1511}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Risk Driven Management was intended to be at the center of the Space Launch Initiative (SLI)\/OSP modes of operation, equal to the triad of cost, schedule and technical excellence. Many changes in risk systems, a shortage of risk experts, and ineffective application demoted risk management to a box to be checked. Additionally: a. Integrate Risk Management Development of a system that involves multiple programs requires a central collection and control of individual program risks that affect the overall system. OSP did not develop an integrated process for assessing and scoring system risks. Nor was OSP risk management integrated with the Launch Services Program (LSP) or International Space Station (ISS) program risks. Cost, schedule, and technical risks associated with the delivery of launch vehicles and ISS elements were not part of the OSP system risk management process which effectively blurred the overall risk exposure to OSP management. b. Risk Management Tools OSP Risk management tools were not fully deployed; Users were not adequately trained, nor was risk management fully implemented. c. Rules of Engagement-Risk The OSP program's desire for a \u201cculture change\u201d in how NASA influences contractor designs was not fully communicated to the supporting engineering groups.","Lesson ID":1500}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Three major contributors to the dilemma within OSP were (1) a lack of a disciplined, well communicated, Level 1 requirements development process, (2) open or architecture-free Level 2 requirements, and (3) contractor-developed Level 3 requirements (system specification). Rigorous requirements development processes consistent with accepted system engineering practices are critical to establishing a good requirements foundation. The Requirements Development Team (RDT) attempted to insert rigor during the Level 2 requirements development in a short time and with a laser-like focus. But for team members not in the laser's light, the RDT was a blackout. Additionally: a. Communication of Requirements. A requirements philosophy paper was written to help communicate the message. Where it failed was in limited distribution and the lack of diligence to get this message to the personnel involved after the process had started. The use of a small, co-located requirements development team (RDT) also tended to isolate people at different centers as well as the contractors from the discussion behind the requirements. This led to confusion in interpretation of the requirements by the contractors and by the Project Managers who were trying to help the contractors with the interpretation. b. OCD in Parallel. Since the Operations Concept Document (OCD) was developed in parallel with the system requirements the two teams tended to focus on different areas of operation. In some instances the desires of the OCD and the requirements of the SRD were in conflict. c. Multiple Level 2 Documents. Requirements controlled at the program level were contained in a number of documents; the Systems Requirements Document (SRD), the ISS\/OSP Interface Requirements Document (IRD), and the Human Rating Plan (HRP). Additional verification requirements were found in the System Verification Plan. Also, some program level requirements were derived from the OCD scenarios and the ELV Interface Design Document (IDD). The locating of Level II requirements in multiple documents did not provide a comprehensive set of Level II system requirements nor provide for consistency of Level III requirements. d. Too much Trade Space. The notion that \u201csaying less gives the contractor more freedom\u201d isn't entirely true. Having not worked in this environment with NASA previously, the contractors struggled to produce the requirements at Level 3. In all cases the Contractors were looking for much more guidance so they would not go down a path that would lead them to losing out on the Full Scale Development. e. Minimum Standards. A minimum set of standards should have been developed to grade the contractors by and to give them a \u201cwatermark\u201d to go by in the development of level 3 requirements. f. Validation Issues. Validation of the system-level requirements for OSP required the use of the contractor's architecture to show that the requirements can, in fact, be met. Having multiple contractors with different architectures made this a daunting task and, due to limited personnel and time, near impossible. The validation of OSP Level 2 requirements was not adequately resolved. g. Requirements Philosophy. A requirements philosophy paper was written to help communicate the message. h. Level 1 Requirements. The process by which the Level 1 Requirements were developed was not clear to the program implementers. Rationale was not provided for the requirements and the resultant set of requirements was never formally transferred to OSP nor placed under configuration control. It was also indicated that pushback was not allowed. This caused major problems when early government-led trades revealed that the requirements might not be entirely feasible. The ambiguity of the requirements led OSP to create a Level 1 requirements interpretation document and place it under configuration management. However, the OSP requirements development team was not able to communicate directly with the Level 1 requirements developers in order to establish agreement on Level 1 requirements interpretation. Level 2 Requirements Development of the Level 2 requirements did not follow established systems engineering guidelines for allocation, inclusion of performance and functional requirements, validation, and feasibility assessments. i. Synchronize Development. Requirement development, analyses, and system design activities were not synchronized. Functional decomposition was not complete before system design started and before Level 3 requirements were base-lined. Also, in the environment of acceleration a Requirements Development Team (RDT), consisting of decision makers from the OSP, Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV) and International Space Station (ISS) Programs and Headquarters, was formed. j. Feasibility Assessment. The process for demonstrating requirements feasibility was unclear.","Lesson ID":1501}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The current NASA human ratings requirements (NPR 9705.2, Human Rating Requirements and Guidelines for Space Flight Systems) are not yet \"field tested\" by application to development through design or flight certification. OSP learned enough just incorporating them into its requirement baseline to warrant an update to the NASA requirement documents. Recognize that as a combined set, these requirements present program risk, because they have never been fielded into a System design. Additionally: a. Launch Vehicle Explosion and Water Survival Failure to incorporate a complete and validated set of crew survival requirements at the beginning of the program led to uncertainty and substantial architectural redesign. Accurate explosion models of the Atlas and Delta launch vehicles do not exist. b. Human Rating of Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV) The ELVs that were to launch the OSP spacecraft were defined to be within the OSP system boundary. For human-rating purposes, the OSP\/ELV combinations were to be treated as a single entity with the OSP system and the ELVs were not going to be separately human rated. However, the human rating adequacy of the ELVs was not fully assessed, and it is doubtful that they would have met acceptable human rating requirements. c.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The high-fidelity SAGE III simulator proved itself to be an invaluable tool in expediting instrument development as well as meeting the requirement to verify and validate flight software changes prior to execution during on-orbit operations. Specific lessons learned follow: The SAGE III high-fidelity simulator was used to verify and validate designs prior to committing to a flight hardware build. This approach allowed designers to test their design in a less restrictive environment than required for flight hardware and correct design problems prior to building flight hardware. We believe that this approach saved time and flight hardware rework. The SAGE III high-fidelity simulator facilitated flight software development. SAGE III flight software was developed in parallel with flight hardware using the high fidelity simulator. Significant schedule and costs were saved using this approach because the hardware and software development was a parallel rather than serial activity. Development risk was reduced by testing flight software on engineering hardware rather than flight hardware. This approach avoided the potential situation where critical and high value flight hardware was operated using unproven flight software. The likelihood of damage to critical flight systems by errant software was avoided using this approach. The high fidelity simulator proved to be invaluable during anomaly troubleshooting during integration and test. For instance, the simulator was used to isolate a hardware problem and to develop a software fix for an interface communications problem that occurred infrequently (two-three times) when the instrument was tested at cold temperatures during thermal vacuum testing. This ability allowed the environmental test program to continue in parallel with the anomaly investigation and work-around solution development. The simulator was used to develop, verify, and validate flight software changes during on-orbit operations. The simulator was needed to work around problems with spacecraft provided data (navigation data and attitude data) and other problems with the flight code found during on-orbit operations but not identified during integration and testing. The instrument operations team assumed responsibility for primary flight software sustaining engineering during spacecraft integration. Formal training and \u201cbehind-the-wheel\u201d operation of the simulator was performed to ensure the operations team was capable and ready to perform these functions. Configuration management of the simulator is required. Particular emphasis should be placed on verifying that the ground simulator configuration and software image match the flight configuration to the greatest extent possible.","Lesson ID":1489}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Expect the Unexpected - Throughout the entire process with the Russian, Ukrainian and Kazakhstan partners, we were subjected to many obstacles, limited resources and knowledge. A project must plan to be self-sufficient when working a project in a foreign country. You must provide everything that you think will be needed and then provide for those unexpected situations. Supplies for contamination control need to be provided by the US side. It was our experience that Russian provided supplies did not meet the requirements that had been established. This was evident with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and ethyl alcohol, clean room garments, clean room wipes, and general clean room facility conditions. You cannot expect your foreign partners to provide supplies that are equivalent to those used in the US, so don't ask them to provide them. The project must also provide contamination control education to the foreign partners so that requirements that have been established can be fully understood and implemented. Although the understanding of contamination control and the working conditions in Russia and Kazakhstan were different (and difficult at times) from what the US side was used to, in no way should this be deemed a negative item. The experience of working with people from other countries that have limited resources was rewarding in that they had a strong desire to learn and improve their knowledge and systems. We learned from each other in that they (the Russians) are able to do more with less than we could ever consider doing as evidenced by the Mir Space Station.","Lesson ID":1490}

The testing should be done early in the design cycle to minimize the schedule impact of any resulting redesign effort.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"It has been two years since the cracks were originally discovered in the flowliners at the gimbal joint of the LH2 feedlines. In that time, numerous important observations, analyses, and tests have been accomplished. The ITA Team found extensive documentation archived on a web site (SSPWEB) maintained by the Program Office. However, the preponderance of documentation is in the form of briefing charts prepared for oral presentations. Also, the team found extensive technical information available from individual engineers working on the problem resolution team. Unfortunately, much of this information was not properly documented in formal engineering reports. Also, there is no evidence that critical findings were formally peer reviewed. While numerous examples of incomplete documentation could be sited, two specific examples are discussed below to illustrate the potential implications of the lack of technical rigor that might occur when formal documentation is not required and the results are not independently verified through peer review. The location, orientation, and length of cracks originally found in the fleet in 2002 could not be determined from the original documentation given to the ITA Team. In fact, the numerous problem summary briefings given by engineers and senior team leaders, dating from August 2002 to January 2004, contained conflicting data on both the number of cracks found in each orbiter and the length of these cracks. To resolve these discrepancies, an extensive effort was required to re-analyze the original inspection data obtained in 2002. During this effort to establish accurate crack information, it was discovered that several cracks were kinked rather than extending in a self-similar crack growth direction as was implied by the sketches and analyses reported in the briefing charts. This is a significant finding because kinked cracks like those found in the orbiters, typically exhibit bifurcation behavior and change crack growth direction due to complexities in the global stress field. This is critical information in determining the root causes of the cracks observed in the fleet. In fact, incorrect conclusions regarding the problem resolution could have resulted from this omission of critical evidence. As part of the investigation, two engine hot fire test series were conducted at Stennis Space Center. The purpose of these tests was to better understand the feedline flow physics and the associated forcing functions, which define the spectrum loadings on the flowliner. The first test series used a BTA with a fixed joint and without a flexible bellow. The second test series used a GTA with a gimbaled joint and flexible bellow. Not only did NASA invest considerable resources to conduct these tests, the interpretation of the test results has led to an escalation in concern over the structural integrity of the flowliners and an additional expenditure of tens of millions of dollars in an attempt to develop a new flight rationale. Yet, there is no formal test report that documents the calibration of instrumentation, test procedures, sequence of test events, test data acquisition, and post-test data reduction. Furthermore, there is no formal documentation of the engineering details regarding how the data was used to develop a loading spectrum and the associated prediction of the residual fatigue lives of the flowliners.","Lesson ID":1486}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"One of the most difficult obstacles to overcome in the flowliner investigation has been the disparity of the propellant feed systems between the ground-based test facility and the flight vehicle. NASA does not have a Flight-Configured Main Propulsion System (MPS) Ground Test Facility that accurately simulates the flight environment. Differences between the ground-based test facility and the flight vehicle can singularly and collectively degrade the fidelity of ground-based hot fire tests in characterizing the flight environment. Examples encountered during the course of this investigation include the following: Differences in the feedline weld bead in feedline between flowliners and SSME interface; Differences in thermal insulation (i.e., vacuum jacket vs. BX-250 SOFI) on the feedlines; Differences in feedline layout (i.e., line lengths, bends, flex joints, valves, flow meters); and Differences in sensors and sensor locations. The inability to accurately replicate the flight conditions of the MPS in a ground test has been a persistent difficulty in determining the fundamental root cause of the flowliner issue. Significant resources and schedule time have been expended to overcome the need for a test facility that replicates the collective environment (e.g., flow, structural, dynamic, thermal, etc.) of the actual flight vehicle. A facility dedicated to subjecting the engine and supporting feed system to a high-fidelity flight environment could be used for acceptance tests, green run tests, and fleet leader extension tests.The MPTA was useful in certifying the MPS for the shuttle, but was retired early in the program. It would not be necessary to configure the system to accommodate all the engines used in the MPS, but to replicate the fluid environment that one engine would be exposed to, with the flexibility of expanding the resolution of the system environment to include as many engines as needed. With regard to the MPS environment of subsequent vehicle programs, the instrumentation suite incorporated into the ground facility could be integrated into the propellant system without significant affect to the characterization of the system environment.","Lesson ID":1487}

But, the high-pressure air, which contained significant amounts of water, enabled on event to cause both conditions. The valve leaked in a manner that resulted in the Joule-Thompson effect. This caused the high-pressure air to be \"throttled\" to a lower pressure and much lower temperature (on the order of -50 F).

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"During flight hardware integration, priority and precedence must be given to completion of the electrical power interface Safe-To-Mate procedures. Priority and precedence for testing flight hardware implies that Safe-To-Mate is the first test procedure during integration. No other electrical integration procedures should commence until Safe-To-Mate procedure is completed. Incorrect power interfaces have cause more flight hardware damage than any other electronic hardware failure mode. The initial application of power is a continuous process. This process proceeds from component acceptance through flight instrument hardware and systems level integration and test. It cannot be understated the risk associated with the initial application of power to flight hardware. Particularly, when the test configuration is changed from component to subsystem or systems level testing, which involves a change in the power cable and harness interface. There is an inherent, and potentially grave, risk with changing existing and established NASA policies and procedures. This is especially true during flight hardware integration, when the intent is to expedite an accelerated schedule. Project management must exercise extreme care and diligence during integration, since there is a significant risk is associated with damaging hardware and\/or physical injury.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Re-Use of Existing Operational Components Lowers Cost and Reduces Risk. These are two of the obvious benefits gained by using operational components in the development and early operations of the NGN. The NGN was able to leverage the considerable investment by NASA in the multi-mission capabilities of the Alaska Synthetic Aperture Radar Faility, the Wallops Flight Facility, CSOC's Data Services Management Center, the EOSDIS Mission Support Network, the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Collectively these organizations provided data capture and Level 0 processing, domestic and international network connectivity, and archive and distribution capabilities. It was determined early in the design concept phase that it would be prohibitively expensive to develop all of the capabilities needed for the ADEOS-II NGN \"from scratch.\" The re-use of existing management structures and systems was the obvious solution for a cost-effective solution to meet the requirements for NASA's support of ADEOS-II NGN requirements. During the design and early operations phase, all of the NGN component organizations provided the highest caliber of support to the project and program goals. The success of the NGN in meeting its requirements for support of the ADEOS-II mission is a positive lesson learned about the benefits of re-using and integrating operational components to meet ground system mission requirements.","Lesson ID":1347}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The lessons learned from the Project's unsuccessful transition from a small informal academic type of team into a project-oriented team are: 1. Project management should be included in the proposal stage of a project's life cycle since the lack of front-end PM support increases the difficulty to introduce a project environment later. 2. Inserting a PM into a project for a \"recovery\" or \"rescue\" mission may be an unwelcome and unsuccessful venture if the project does not recognize its potential value and\/or does not identify with the incoming PM. 3. Do not expect a team to \"abandon\" their loyalty to the PI in favor of an outside PM. 4. Do not expect an academic team to buy into formal PM processes immediately. 5. Abrupt and frequent PM changes create\/increase the rift between the science\/engineering team and the management team. This also gives the appearance that Senior Management does not view or appreciate the critical role which project management plays in a project's success or that the project is not valued. 6.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Match COTS tools to project requirements. Deciding to use a COTS product as the basis of system software design is potentially risky, but the potential benefits include quicker delivery, less cost, and more reliability in the final product. The following lessons were learned in the definition phase of the SAFS\/CSAFS development. Use COTS products and re-use previously developed internal products. Create a prioritized list of desired COTS features. Talk with local experts having experience in similar areas. Conduct frequent peer and design reviews. Obtain demonstration versions of COTS products. Obtain customer references from vendors. Select a product appropriately sized for your application. Choose a product closely aligned with your project's requirements. Select a vendor whose size will permit a working relationship. Use vendor tutorials, documentation, and vendor contacts during COTS evaluation period. Test and prototype COTS products in the lab. The prototyping and test phase of the COTS evaluation allows problems to be identified as the system design to matures. These problems can be mitigated (often with the help and cooperation of the COTS vendor) well before the field-testing phase at which time it may be too costly or impossible to retrofit a solution. The following lessons were learned in the prototyping and test phase of the SAFS\/CSAFS development. Prototype your systems hardware and software in a lab setting as similar to the field environment as possible; simulate how the product will work on various customer platforms; model the field operations; develop in stages with ongoing integration and testing Pass pertinent information on to your customers Accommodate your customers, where possible, by building in alternative options Don't approve all requests for additional options by customers or new projects that come on line. Select the best COTS components for product performance even if they are from multiple vendors.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Engage Operational Component Management in Integration and Testing. Integration of NGN's many components was a challenge both in terms of the management of the system-to-system interfaces and in the management of lines of authority and reporting for the various organizations involved. One of the methods used to manage this complexity was to charter a quarterly review panel consisting of \u201cstake-holder\u201d participants with management authority of the various NGN components. The actual ADEOS-II review panel consisted of stake-holder participants from NASA\/GSFC Code 450 (ground station and CSOC responsibilities), NASA\/GSFC Code 420 (EOS-G Program Office), NASA\/GSFC Code 423 (DAACs and networking), NASA\/GSFC Code 290 (networks), NOAA\/NESDIS (real-time interfaces). Code 300 (quality assurance) also participated as a panel member, and NASA\/JPL participated ex officio (SeaWinds management). The ADEOS-II quarterly review panel proved to be very effective in identifying and working-off actions at the management level, and in directing actions to the working level as needed during the late phases of development and testing.

This resulted in additional fuel flow to the MCC and Nozzle coolant circuit and reduced fuel flow to the preburners. The increased MCC coolant flow resulted in an increased LPFP turbine flow which increased its speed and its discharge pressure which in turn exceeded the LPFP discharge pressure sensor qualification limit and resulted in an MCF. The lack of sufficient fuel to the preburners caused the high turbine discharge temperatures which approached the redlines.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The extension deck mover left the main engine deck and proceeded to the position of the secured extension deck that was put in place for the pump installation job. He then, by himself, pushed the GSE to a position he thought was off the extension deck platform. He could not see the GSE because an orange tarp used for weather and FOD protection was blocking his view of not only the GSE position, but also the main deck. He told the team he thought the GSE was off the extension deck because he felt a bump which he believed to be the GSE rolling onto the main deck from the extension deck. The technician did not verify that the GSE was actually on the main deck. At this time he loosened and released the two turnbuckles located on either side of the extension deck. As the extension deck moved the GSE tilted off the main deck pinning the other employee's back against the arm of the GSE and his abdomen against the west main deck handrail.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"During ground testing, a SUBSA Ground Unit Thermal Chamber temperature of about 820 C with qualification Sample Ampoule assemblies (SUBSA-GD1, SUBSA-Q3, and SUBSA-Q4) was sufficient to melt all of the sample charge (approx. 37mm) + about 4mm of the sample's seed. This met the SUBSA Principal Investigator's desire to melt about 2mm into the seed. However, during SUBSA's on-orbit experiment, the flight heater unit temperature of 820 C did not melt into the seed. To melt further into the seed, SUBSA tried to issue a setpoint change command to increase the Thermal Chamber's temperature. The Eurotherm 2408 Controller that controls the Thermal Chamber's temperature would not accept any setpoint change commands above 825 C. Therefore, the SUBSA Thermal Chamber hot zone temperature did not reach the commanded setpoint that is required to achieve the desired science result of melting 2mm into the sample material seed. Overall, the problems experienced with the SUBSA flight hardware and flight software can be directly attributed to programmatic budget and schedule constraints which resulted in inadequate run-time using flight software with flight hardware end items as well as last minute software loads and\/or changes to flight software after shipment to KSC for pre-launch processing.","Lesson ID":1319}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Several lessons learned are identified from the subject incident: The excessive amount of propellants accumulated in the chamber was the main contributor to the test failure. This accumulation might have been caused by the unintended time delay in the LOX\/RP-1 ignition. Consequently, the eventual ignition led to the chamber over-pressurization. Although GOX\/GH2 torch igniters have been used in igniting LOX\/RP-1 systems, the database and experience of such an igniter for the LOX\/RP-1 system are limited. The use of this igniter type for LOX\/RP-1 along with its location with respect to the chamber might have caused some delay time in the ignition and created the first two events as stated in the previous section. In this test sequence, LOX was injected to the chamber prior to the RP-1 injection. It has been speculated that RP-1 might have become frozen during this ignition delay. Past data indicates that frozen RP-1\/LOX combustion releases an excessive energy creating an over-pressurization in the combustion chamber. Furthermore, due to the nature of the of the vortex chamber flow field, the startup transient is not well understood. For the aforementioned reasons, a better-characterized igniter, such as TEA\/TEB, should be applied. To detect the ignition\/combustion occurrence, the vortex chamber should be monitored for an increase in pressure. The value of this increase and the detection duration depend on individual test conditions and the chamber configuration. Theoretically, it is possible to estimate these values; however, it is very difficult and tedious to accurately predict them. They are normally determined through initial hot-fire tests, which was also one of the objectives of the fourth test. For this particular test, the test duration was set for 2.00 seconds and the incident occurred at 1.38 seconds within the duration. Given the lack of data, this duration should be set conservatively at a lower value. If the duration does not allow enough time for ignition, a small incremental step can be added to the waiting time. This method, however, may require more tests in order to study the startup conditions. Historically, most traditional LOX\/RP-1 chambers have used an L* (chamber volume\/throat ratio) between 35 to 96 inches. The L* for this vortex chamber was approximately 12 inches. It should be mentioned that one of benefits of the vortex chamber concept is to have a small chamber. At the time of the design, this L* value was selected based on an existing Army chamber configuration for a gelled hypergolic propellant system. Later, Army engineers learned that a longer delay in ignition requires a larger chamber volume in order to eliminate the chamber over-pressurization during the startup. From the aforementioned data, a larger L* value should be considered in the final chamber configuration. The Army Vortex test program did not require the IRIG time stamp on the high-speed film . Therefore, it was not active during this series of tests. Normally, the film is only processed in the event of an anamoly. In this incident, the high-speed film provided the best data of what occurred and without the time stamp it required personnel reviewing the film and manually linking the event with the test sequence and data . This method is not as precise as the IRIG method. For the future, the IRIG time stamp should be the standard without the program having to request this option. Normally test articles and facilities are not instrumented for failures. In this case, the thrust measurement system constraints did not allow for close coupling of the facility and test article instrumentation and would have been fine for successful steady state tests. In the future the instrumentation requirements should be more carefully evaluated and where possible instrument for a failure while maintaining the program requirements, schedule and budget. In conclusion, the vortex chamber design concept involves flow vortices and combustion behaviors which are not observed in conventional combustion chambers. In addition, existing numerical prediction methods may not be able to accurately predict or describe all startup transients and other phenomenal aspects, including two-phase flow, propellant mixing, flow field characteristics, etc. A conservative approach in the test article design and test planning should be taken to minimize test failure potentials. A gradual change in the hardware design and testing, leading to the eventual optimum configuration, should be considered after experience with the vortex chamber concept is gained. Recommendations: The vortex chamber configuration, test conditions and test sequence should be improved to minimize propellant accumulation during the ignition process. This may include: An increase in the chamber volume A reduction of the initial propellant injection flow rate to the chamber No pre-chilling or using gaseous oxygen during the startup to ease the ignition process Shortening the duration of the chamber ignition detection Other igniter types, such as a TEA\/TEB, provide shorter ignition delays and therefore might prove to be better ignition sources. Changes in the igniter location should also be considered to minimize the ignition delay time. Prior to attempting to derive the optimum combustion chamber design, a conservative approach should be taken in the hardware design and test planning. This should help to ensure that experience is gained with the vortex chamber. A time stamp on the high-speed film should become the standard practice where applicable. The instrumentation requirements should be more carefully evaluated and where possible instrument for a failure while maintaining the program requirements, schedule and budget. The Safety Assessment included a Quantity Distance of 160 feet, based on the amount of propellant on the test stand. Fragments from the detonation traveled 480 feet. The Safety Assessment for hot fire testing should include fragmentation predictions for a detonation in the test article. The MSFC Industrial safety Department is working to acquire the necessary expertise and develop procedures for inclusion of fragmentation predictions in the Safety Assessment. This will provide for improved personnel and equipment hazard mitigation techniques.","Lesson ID":1310}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The approach to risk reduction mentioned above is credited with contributing significantly to the project's success, specifically: Having two complete systems allowed the project to take an aggressive approach with respect to ground tests and flight envelope expansion.

The overall project milestones could be protected\/met by using vehicle number two for spare parts.

Additionally, the approach mentioned above introduced several concerns: Producing two complete systems spread the workforce very thinly, especially when resources between the two efforts were shared and\/or had overlapping schedules.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"As outlined below, relying only on procedures to control an undesired event can result in a catastrophic failure. The planned test conditions at the time of the mishap (M = 0.8, move the cowl down to an angle of 8*) had not been properly reviewed and assessed. Data recorded at a test condition just prior to the mishap (M=0.8, cowl fixed at 8*) indicated that these conditions resulted in a sting roll moment (26,487 in-lbs) above the allowable limit (26,000 in-lbs). Also, at M = 0.8, the cowl moved down quicker than expected. This meant the operator response time to activate the cowl's brake was critical. As the cowl moved down, the operator did not activate the brake quick enough to stop the cowl at 8*; consequently, it traveled to its maximum angle of 13*. Note, conditions of M = 0.8, 13* had not been analyzed prior to testing. With the cowl at 13*, M = 0.8, the aerodynamic loads resulted in sting loads that exceeded the sting's limits and caused the sting to deflect downward. This deflection decreased the angle of attack by a few degrees (i.e., it became more negative), which increased the aerodynamic forces even more. In other words, excessive aerodynamic forces caused sting deflection that resulted in increasing the already excessive aerodynamic forces. At this point, the aerodynamic forces caused sting loads that far exceeded the sting limits, resulting in ultimate failure of the sting.","Lesson ID":1265}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"As outlined below, failure to properly identify, review and assess worst-case test conditions can result in a chain of events that result in a major mishap. The planned test conditions at the time of the mishap (M = 0.8, move the cowl down to an angle of 8*) had not been properly reviewed and assessed. Data recorded at a test condition just prior to the mishap (M=0.8, cowl fixed at 8*) indicated that these conditions resulted in a sting roll moment 26,487 in-lbs, which was above the allowable limit of 26,000 in-lbs. Also, at M = 0.8, the cowl moved down quicker than expected. This meant the operator response time to activate the cowl's brake was critical. As the cowl moved down, the operator did not activate the brake quick enough to stop the cowl at 8*; consequently, it traveled to its maximum angle of 13*. Note, conditions of M = 0.8, 13* had not been analyzed prior to testing. With the cowl at 13*, M = 0.8, the aerodynamic loads resulted in sting loads that exceeded the sting's limits and caused the sting to deflect downward. This deflection decreased the angle of attack by a few degrees (i.e., it became more negative), which increased the aerodynamic forces even more. In other words, excessive aerodynamic forces caused sting deflection that resulted in increasing the already excessive aerodynamic forces. At this point, the aerodynamic forces caused sting loads that far exceeded the sting limits, resulting in ultimate failure of the sting.","Lesson ID":1261}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"An SPC Investigation Team and an independent NASA Investigation Board were unable to determine the exact cause of the close call. The closest duplication of the event was obtained from the Malfunction Laboratory tests of the crane metadyne and the crane 4NCR relay contacts. A metadyne is an externally driven D.C. generator, which amplifies an operator initiated control signal to regulate trolley speed. When closed, the 4NCR relay contacts provide the control signal to the metadyne. Other crane components that could have caused an increase in trolley speed were removed from crane #1 and tested in the Malfunction Laboratory. None exhibited abnormal results. The Board recognized that operator actions could have produced the observed segment motion. However, based on testimony of the two operators, the investigation board concluded that the operators most likely did not induce the rapid unexpected movement of the segment. Metadyne output voltage changes with no change to the input voltage were observed on numerous occasions during crane tests as well as during Malfunction Laboratory testing. These output changes could be induced by misaligning brushes, lightly tapping the brushes, injecting cleaning stone silica or cleaning cloth fibers into the commutator\/brush area, or elevating humidity and temperature. Further the crane metadynes are operated at 2 percent of output capacity, which exacerbates these output instabilities. Review of text books and technical papers, and conversations with technical experts indicate that metadyne systems are susceptible to erratic outputs. The voltage output changes observed in the lab were significant in magnitude and, based on analysis, were large enough to produce the maximum calculated trolley velocity. On September 14, 1992, in VAB High Bay #2, crane #2 bridge (same design as crane #1) experienced erratic acceleration, other unexpected responses, and eventually stopped completely. Troubleshooting determined that the control voltage input to the metadyne system was zero. Relay contacts that provide this control voltage were cleaned and crane operations returned to normal. Additional Malfunction Laboratory tests were performed on the power supply relay contacts and potentiometers. The relay contacts should have a resistance in the milliohm range but laboratory measurements were unstable and in the range of 100 ohms to 3 gigaohms. High resistance of the power supply contacts on the night of the close call could have occurred and, after a few minutes, the high resistance could have returned to normal. This would result in a sudden increase of trolley speed from a reduced to a full FINE speed condition of approximately 25 feet per minute. This very closely duplicates the timing and speeds that occurred during the close call. In summary, the exact cause of this crane close call is not known. The most likely causes were determined to be an erratic operation of the metadyne caused by cleaning material contamination of the brush\/commutator area or an excessive resistance increase of the control system relay contacts that suddenly returned to its proper value. The contributing cause to the close call was determined to be that metadyne output varies with constant input. Because metadynes are susceptible to unexpected changes in output, careful consideration of design and operating controls is required. Proper relay contact selection is especially important in a low current control system.","Lesson ID":1187}

When the advisory was lifted the spacecraft would have to go through another power-up cycle and engineering assessment prior to verifying a \"go for launch\" condition.

The Atlas vehicle, on the other hand, maintains its powered\/unpowered state so as to minimize electrical potential differences in the presence of the lightening condition. The GOES policy was cause for significant concern amongst the launch vehicle community, and this concern amplified because the policy was not fully understood by all parties until just days before the scheduled launch ( July, a month with significant lightening potential at the Cape).","Lesson ID":1194}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Communication System: Frame Control: Each communication system mainframe has attached to it a large status indicator. These indicators are used to control access to the frames and are remotely operated by communications personnel. However, only those frames presently used to support Shuttle operations or those in facilities directly supporting Shuttle operations are controlled. Frames, in facilities like PHSF, are kept in the \"OPEN\" state, allowing uncontrolled access for any type of work or troubleshooting. Critical Functions: Critical functions that are routed through comm. frames are not identified or protected, except for Fire Alarm indications. F\/A pairs utilize red & white jumper wires and have plastic terminal covers to prevent accidental shorts. All other pairs utilize black & white jumper wires. Jumper wires are used to make connections between the vertical columns of terminals on one side of the frame to the horizontal rows of terminals on the opposite side. Documentation: There were no formal troubleshooting procedures being followed, nor was there any documentation of the troubleshooting steps being performed. Troubleshooting was performed using radio, telephone, and handsets. The only traceability was from radio channel recording; telephone and handset communication are not recorded. There seemed to be no distinction in trouble-shooting methods employed for critical vs. non-critical circuits. Water Deluge System: Drawings: The system schematics of the Water Deluge System at the PHSF did not reflect that the control lines between the Control Building (M7-1357) and the Service Building (M7-1354) were routed through comm. system Frames. They incorrectly showed direct dedicated lines between the buildings Separation: The \"ARM & ACTIVATE\" values are manually operated from three control panels, two located in the Service Building (M7-1354) and one located in the Control Building (M7-1357). These panels contain momentary pushbuttons for opening and closing each value (redundant pair). When activated, a pushbutton provides a current path between two control wires. This causes a pair of control relays to activate and latch themselves in the \"on\" state. Any connection between the two control wires will have the same effect as operating a pushbutton. The Water Deluge System at the PHSF is implemented such that the control wires are in a common pair and appear on physically adjacent terminals in at least six places. Routing: The control lines for the \"ARM & ACTIVATE\" valves are routed through Terminal Distributors and Frames along with lines from other systems. There is no access control on this equipment; it is accessible for work or troubleshooting by people with no knowledge of the presence of criticality of the Water Deluge circuitry. Monitoring: The Water Deluge control logic is designed and implemented such that there is no monitoring or traceability of which panel and\/or pushbutton was actuated. Therefore it is impossible to tell if the system was actuated by a malfunction of by a switch actuation. Other Facilities: There are at least 15 other facilities with the Water Deluge Systems utilizing remote control panels. There is a high probability that these systems are implemented that same as the PHSF system. Contractor Interface: Fragmentation of the fire Protection systems prevent the individual contractors and their NASA counterparts from understanding the overall system and how their part of the system may affect the whole.","Lesson ID":1198}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"It is the opinion of this mishap investigation team that the primary cause of this mishap was structural failure of the crane at the turret\/mast interface, most probably due to fatigue cracking of the welded area in question. This area had cracked at some previous time and there is evidence of continued crack generation resulting in diminished load lifting capability of the crane. When the switch plate kits were loaded, their weight would not normally have exceeded the lifting capacity of the unit but did exceed its diminished capability. The result was a catastrophic failure leading to personnel injury and equipment damage. Contributing to the failure cause was possible momentary overloading of the crane. No data was discovered that indicated the crane had been overloaded and in fact, the design of the hydraulic system precludes that from happening. No evidence was found, however, of operator training beyond on-the-job experience and that lack of proper training could have resulted in poor operating technique imparting momentary loads well in excess of crane capability, setting up a progressive fatigue cracking mechanism. The weld area in question had cracked at some time prior to this failure and there was evidence of attempts to repair cracks. The workmanship of this repair was extremely poor and failed to correct the problem. The fatigue cracking continued to progress to the point of failure. Also noted during this investigation were deficiencies in meeting contractual and OSHA\/ANSI requirements. No evidence was found of daily, weekly, or monthly safety inspections of the equipment or contractually required safety reports. No evidence was found of an annual inspection for safety and operability. No evidence was found that the operators had received any training beyond on-the-job instruction on operation of the unit. The injured employee was to be transported to the hospital by a NASA helicopter but this wasn't done due to a lack of proper transport capability of the helicopter.","Lesson ID":1186}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The primary and major contributory causes of the mishap were: Failure to remove the beam. If the standard sequence of access platform removal is followed, the beam is one of the last components to come out. Also, the beam cannot be safely removed until either the 50-1 or 50-2 entry level platforms are removed. Since other scheduled work was in process, requiring the entry level platforms, the beam was temporarily and intentionally left resting against the 1307 bulkhead for approximately 40 minutes. Due to the elapsed time and remote location of the beam, plus reduced lighting, the beam was forgotten and overlooked. The check and balance by the technician and the Quality Control inspector failed. The technician and inspector were using a job card matrix, consisting of prerecorded platform component numbers which had been initially recorded during platform component installation. The removal check-off and accountability operation was being performed at floor level as opposed to the more traditional method of verification where the platform components are removed and verified as they cross the access ' door thresholds. The rationale for this change consisted of three considerations: (A) the bay was destined for maintenance rather than early roll-in of the next orbiter and, therefore, the platform components had to be completely removed from the work site and stowed; (B) the area where the platform components would have been inventoried and temporarily stowed was congested; (C) an opinion existed that a better check-off and accountability could be accomplished at the floor level rather than at the 50-1 and 50-2 access door exits. The team responsible for job card matrix execution and ultimate removal verification consisted of one technician and one inspector. Several technicians were transporting the platform set assemblies from the 50-1 and 50-2 doors to the floor. As the technician read component part numbers, the quality inspector checked off the pre-recorded matrix. There were reported confusion factors consisting of multiple numbers on components and faded numbers; however, there was no practical correlation between these factors to explain why an error in accounting for the platform components occurred. For an unknown reason, the G070-502677-001 beam was counted as having been removed, and therefore, no subsequent search for it was made. A probable scenario for the human error follows: piece number G070-502777-001 was mistakenly checked off the inventory list as G070-502677-001. After almost the entire inventory of platforms had been completed, the Tech and QC on the OPP floor started to review the inventory list to account for several items that had not yet been verified. Piece number G070-502777-001 was still not verified. In reviewing the assemblage of components, the Tech and QC found G070-502777-001 in the equipment storage area and marked it off the inventory list. Thus, component G070-502777-001 was probably counted twice as two pieces of equipment. This scenario was not presented by the Tech or QC, but is the most probable sequence of events that the Board feels occurred.","Lesson ID":1199}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Failure of the bridge operator to follow the approved procedure, which requires verification that the Zero-G System is not hooked up prior to bridge movement and assignment of an observer, was the major contributing cause of this mishap. The second contributing cause involved multiple deficient control systems to preclude bridge operation while connected to the Zero-G Simulator. Supervisory control of the bridge power key was nonexistent, allowing technicians free access to bridge keys. Procedural steps included in Operations and Maintenance Instruction (OMI) V3575 to tag the bridge\/bucket system out of service and secure the key during Zero-G operations were not referenced in the OMI V9023 that configured the PLBD and Zero-G System for PLBD operations. Shift tie-in from the third shift Mechanical\/Electrical\/TCS Supervisor to the first shift Electrical\/TCS Supervisor did not occur. In addition, the first shift Electrical\/TCS Supervisor was not aware of the scheduled PLBD operations status nor did he perform a complete walkdown. Therefore, the supervisor assigning work requiring bridge operations was not aware the Zero-G System was connected. The work assigned to the bridge operator involved in this mishap did not appear either on the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) shop schedule or the KSC Integrated Contractor Schedule (KICS). Had this work been properly integrated into the KICS schedule, work involving bridge movement would have been scheduled to occur after use of the Zero-G Simulator was complete. The third contributing cause is attributed to this lack of integrated scheduling. Improper raising of the right PLBD prompted a detailed inspection of the door structure but no damage was found that could be directly attributed to this mishap.","Lesson ID":1200}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"On Friday August 30, 1991 the EMA Group performed radio frequency (RF) field intensity measurements at the launch site within 3 feet of the launcher. The ambient environment was measured to be less than or equal to one volt\/meter. These same levels were observed when an idling automobile was in the area. Two local radars were analyzed showing approximately zero volts\/meter. The hand held radios were tested, as well as the base station. All RF measured sources were not, in the opinion of the EMA, considered to be of sufficient strength to cause a RF induced ignition of the rocket. The MSL personnel made an analysis of the electrostatic conditions at the time of the mishap. The French scientist's clothing and shoes were tested for electrostatics, and were ruled out as having contributed to the incident. The fiberglas launcher was evaluated and an electrostatic charge could be induced on the launch tube; however, MSL's opinion was that it was not sufficient enough to be a contributing factor. In addition, the humidity levels recorded at the time of the mishap were 80 percent or greater which in the expert opinion of the MSL personnel would not enhance electrostatic characteristics. Therefore, electrostatic phenomenon was ruled out as a credible contributing factor. One additional area that was addressed was that of the dissimilar metals used in the construction of the launcher. MSL personnel measured this galvanic action and found that the assembly was producing 60 millivolts of electricity at 12 milliamps of current. This is insufficient current to ignite the rocket motor. The manufacturer's specification on the igniter is 200 milliamps no fire current and 300 milliamps all fire current. The board has also reviewed related incidents at Wallops Island and found that there were internal grounding changes made to the Mighty Mouse because of fin connection and other reasons. Wallops, however, has had no specifically related incidents, (due to payload power supplies). The primary cause of the mishap was a \"sneak circuit\" that existed between the 13.5 Volts Direct Current (V DC) payload power supply and the \"Bridge Wire\" squib which ignites the booster rocket propellant. This \"sneak circuit\" actually used all of the normal firing circuit safety switches and shorting jumpers as an electrical path to ignite the motor. A mini phone plug is inserted to open the 13.5 V DC payload power circuit. Previously, a non-conductive lanyard had been remotely actuated to withdraw the mini plug just prior to launch to activate the payload power circuit. On August 26, 1991 a piece of electrical wire was substituted as a lanyard. The wire was soldered to the mini plug on one end and attached to a small pneumatic withdrawal piston on the other end. This connection made electrical contact with the piston clevis, which is grounded to the launcher structure. As the mini plug is inserted into the payload jack it momentarily contacts the + 13.5 V DC power supply circuit which then charges the launcher frame to 13.5v DC. The spring loaded \"J-hook\" which secures the rocket from falling through the tube and normally would supply the negative side of the 27 V DC booster firing circuit inadvertently contacts the launcher frame due to rotation when loaded by the rocket fin in the launch tube. At this point the J-hook sees the +13.5 V DC which is now conducted to the center of the \"hot shoe\" of the bridge wire squib by the conductive copper safety shorting tape. This applied a +13.5 V DC to one side of the bridge wire. Normally this condition would not allow a difference in potential across the bridge wire since the circuit shorted to the motor case and the fin with the tape jumper is also grounded to the motor case. The fin to motor case connection, however, is made with a roll pin, which allows the resistance to vary (loose ground). Current will flow through the 1.5 ohm bridge wire igniter circuit if the fin to rocket connection is greater than 1.5 ohms. This connection was measured by the MSL to vary to over 400 ohms. Current flow was also measured at greater than 1 amp in field tests. The squib is specified to no-fire at 200mA and fire at greater than 300mA. Primary Cause: The existence of a sneak circuit along with the fact that the payload power source was being interrupted\/connected at the time of the incident, caused the inadvertent ignition of the 2.75 inch FFAR\/Mighty Mouse Rocket. Contributing Causes: The design and construction of the 2.75 inch FFAR does not provide a reliable electrical connection between the rocket fins and the nozzle plate. Electrical resistance at this point caused current to flow through the lower resistance ignitor circuit. The payload arming device, which switches the payload motors on and off with a mini phone plug, was connected to the pneumatic withdrawal piston with a piece of electrical wire. The electrical wire was soldered to the mini plug and secured to the piston with a screw, completing an electrical flow path. The RTLP TOPS 2, Rev B, \"Test Operation of 2.75 FFAR11 needs additional review. The procedure does not detail the step by step operations of preparing, loading and launching the 2.75 FFAR. All agencies (NASA, US Air Force and the French operations) should make these necessary modifications. In addition, the procedure needs warnings for \"Hazardous Steps\" and notes indicating \"End of Hazardous Step\" within each section of sequences. During the inadvertent launch, there was a person fishing from a boat within the designated control area of Mosquito Lagoon. The fisherman indicated that the rocket came within 300 yards of his boat. Observations: There was no safety professional\/observer required on site while handling, loading and preparing the 2.75 FFAR for launch readiness. The RTLP Tops 2, Rev B only requires a safety concurrence, which was done by phone on the day of the mishap. The 2.75 FFAR Launcher Assembly was fabricated with dissimilar metals (aluminum, steel, and cadmium plated bolts). Galvanic action was measured and found to provide 12 mA, which is insufficient current to ignite the rocket motor. However, over a long period of time, this could result in corrosion problems. The current flow is very undesirable. The RTLP TOPS, Rev B did not specify the required control\/clear area around the staging site and launcher assembly area. In addition, there were no man loading requirements identifying the number of personnel required to complete the hazardous steps for each operation. The RTLP TOPS, Rev B did not specify the required control\/clear area around the staging site and launcher assembly area. In addition, there were no man loading requirements identifying the number of personnel required to complete the hazardous steps for each operation. It was noted during the removal of the two unused 2.75 FEAR from the launcher (tubes 1 and 4) that the U.S. Air Force M\/Sgt took steps to avoid possible electrical static charge dissipation into the launch system. Before touching the ordnance, he grounded himself to earth ground then to the launcher frame. It was noted that the injured person was standing on the launcher assembly while making adjustments to the payload arming device (mini plug). There was a portable work stand within 10 feet of the launch assembly available for use while working on the rocket and its payload. It was noted that the French personnel were wearing personally owned white coveralls. The procedure called for NASA roved \"Blue Collar\" coveralls. The French were given verbal approval for use of their own coveralls. There was no deviation or waiver documented to approve the change.","Lesson ID":1185}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The chemical reaction within a fuel cell continues to generate electrical power and water when reactants (02 and H2) are present and electrical loads connected. In this case the Fuel Cells 2 and 3, with electrical loads connected, were at reduced voltage levels because helium had mixed with the 02 in quantities sufficient to reduce the efficiency of the fuel cells. The helium ingestion was a result of an inadequate test procedure that performed ground support equipment (GSE) setups for controlled venting, fuel cell power down, cryogenic drain. This procedure had been reviewed and approved by the appropriate engineering organizations. STS-43 was the third KSC landing since the Challenger accident and the first time the GSE back pressure regulator confidence test was performed while the fuel cells were powered. The pressure specified in the test procedure for the GSE back pressure regulator exceeded the vehicle 02 manifold pressure allowing GSE helium to enter the fuel cell 02 supply. The power reactanta storage and distribution fuel cell (PRSD\/FC) Engineer thought the GSE pressure could be controlled by additional valve cycling not covered in the procedure and elected to perform the back pressure regulator test instead of implementing a real time change to the test procedure. The GSE pressure exceeded the orbiter onboard flight disconnect specification cracking pressure by 12 psi and 6 psi for five seconds and eight seconds respectively. GSE pressure levels commanded by the PRSD\/FC engineer were within limits defined in the test procedure. Ingestion of helium into the fuel cells does not harm them, although it does degrade performance. This performance loss initiated a sequence of events which led to potential damage to Fuel Cells 2 and 3. The Shuttle emergency power down procedures must react to all possible contingencies and configure the hardware to an absolute safe condition. The test team's reaction to unplanned events must be preplanned and implemented without hesitation or deliberation. A fuel cell is considered the most reliable power source available and therefore multiple failures were not considered to be a realistic occurrence. Engineering and management, both government and contractor, had developed a feeling of security regarding emergency power down. The Emergency Power.Down procedure was developed in 1979 for the STS-1 mission, reviewed as part of the post-Challenger Return-to-Flight activities, and has remained essentially unchanged. In retrospect, the technical community should have recognized that these were unusual circumstances, ie., loss of 2 fuel cells, no ground power, etc., and evaluated this specific use of the emergency power down procedure. Without this recognition, the obscure nature of this procedural inadequacy makes it improbable that the failure to disconnect the fuel cells would have been discovered. No one was injured in the mishap. Extent of damage to Fuel Cells 2 and 3 will be determined after evaluation is accomplished at the original equipment manufacturer. Fuel Cells 2 and 3 had used approximately 500 hours and 1500 hours respectively of the 2000 hours of specification operating life. Other orbiter electrical components that were exposed to off nominal bus voltages are under evaluation.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"On Saturday, March 31, the mid-body mechanical supervisor and the lead mechanical technician both had the day off. Supervision was delegated to the lead electrical technician for that shift. He was not familiar with the work to be accomplished or with the capabilities and experience levels of the individuals assigned from the mechanical group. Two individuals were assigned to a task they had not previously performed or observed. The quality inspector was a check and balance that might have caught the error had he been assigned based on his experience with the task or his knowledge of the system. Quality inspectors are not given inspection work based upon their knowledge or previous inspection assignments. They respond to a call-board that lists tasks calling for an inspector; consequently, an inspector appears in a somewhat indiscriminate fashion to perform the inspection task. On second shift, Saturday, March 31, three people unfamiliar with the task came together on platform 4 west to perform and verify Operations and Maintenance Instruction (OMI) V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3. The lead mechanical technician from first shift stayed over to take the assigned technician to platform 4 west to review the task. He failed to mention that the purge vent port should not be capped after removal of the flex hose. There was no precautionary note in the OMI addressing the need to keep the purge vent port clear and open and no placard on the Orbiter. One of the significant shop practices stressed to all technicians working around the Orbiter is to cap disconnected lines or openings to avoid contamination. Personnel are therefore naturally conditioned to cap lines and openings. The fuel cell had to be vented to ambient pressure prior to its removal. The first attempt to vent the fuel cell by a fuel cell system engineer occurred on Wednesday, April 4, at approximately 2 a.m. EDT. The fuel cell was not damaged at this point because the 02 reactant valve did not close. The fact that there was no H2 flow was observed but no Interim Problem Report (IPR) was initiated. A disconnected ground wire from the 02 reactant valve prevented the valve from closing and consequently protected the fuel cell from any damage. A walkdown was not accomplished by engineering. Had such a procedure been implemented, the damage might have been avoided as the fuel cell system engineer might have been alerted to the disconnected ground wire and the capped purge vent port. One thread that runs through the series of events leading up to the mishap is the lack of system training for technicians and quality inspectors. Technicians and quality inspectors are trained and certified in their basic skills, i.e, lockwiring, torquing, etc.; however, they are given no Orbiter systems training. Another factor that contributed to this mishap is the lack of communication between engineering, technicians, and quality. All OMI's are reviewed and approved in detail by several engineering organizations. Some portions of these approved OMI's are then handed over to shop personnel (technicians) to be performed without requiring additional engineering involvement. This same situation exists with the quality inspector who must approve the technicians' work. The personnel are highly motivated and want very much to do a good job. It is essential that they be given the knowledge they need to do that job. The importance of keeping the purge vent port clear and open was not communicated by anyone in the process. The capping of the Orbiter H2 purge vent port during the performance of OMI V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3 was not an isolated incident. On March 19, the same port was capped on the Orbiter Columbia, OV-102, during performance of the same OMI. In this case, an experienced technician checking the work caught the error and had the cap removed. The supervisor was notified but no subsequent action was taken. Had this near-miss been properly communicated to all technicians, engineering, and quality, perhaps the mishap two weeks later could have been avoided. The significance of effective communications cannot be overemphasized in the very complex world of Orbiter processing and test operations. Communications and identification of precautions in the OMI and a good working relationship between the technicians, the engineers, and quality personnel is essential to successful operations. The geography of KSC facilities does not lend itself to ease of overview or development of team unity. The Launch Control Center (LCC) control rooms, from which systems engineers conduct tests, are a considerable distance from the OPF where technicians perform work on the vehicle. The remoteness of the two facilities impedes communications between engineers and technicians. As the program plans new control rooms and equipment, these new rooms could be located in the OPF between the two bays. Many benefits would be derived from the control rooms being in such a location. Having the engineers in close proximity to technicians and the vehicle would improve the overall efficiency of orbiter processing as well as communications among all parties. A key factor in achieving a higher flight rate is reducing OPF flow time. This change could substantially enhance KSC's capability to achieve shorter processing flows. The ability of engineers to perform walkdowns prior to implementing test operations would be greatly facilitated by their proximity and involvement with the work. Operations and Maintenance Instructions are obviously the key documents in ensuring work is done properly at KSC. A review to ensure they are correct and adequate is essential. Following the Challenger accident, direction was given to the design centers to review and concur in all OMI's that affected Criticality 1 or 1R equipment as well as changes to those OMI's. A commitment was also made to the Congress that this would be implemented. In the case of the orbiter, this does not now occur. The Johnson Space Center did review and concur in all OMI's after the Challenger accident and, until the summer of 1989, the JSC Resident Office at KSC concurred in all changes. The apparent lack of discipline in utilizing the paper system resulted in a communication breakdown and confusion that may have contributed to the mishap. There should be a coordinated and documented plan of action between work shifts for accomplishing processing and testing. First and second shifts utilized two different work authorization documents (WAD's) to perform the same task. An IPR was not prepared when anomalous conditions were observed. Constraints were not identified when performing electrical work, i.e., removal of ground wires. A deviation was not logged in a timely fashion. The technicians, engineers, and inspectors at KSC are a highly motivated and dedicated team. Processing and testing of Orbiters is a very complex and demanding task. These personnel are indeed on the firing line three shifts a day, seven days a week. Problems and difficulties are always present. With so much depending upon their ability to perform their work, it behooves us to provide them with all the skills and talents they require. Training, knowledge, and communications are all essential to the task. The cost for repair of this fuel cell is significant, but considering Space Shuttle Operations will continue for as long as 20 more years, it could be an inexpensive lesson if we can learn from this accident and truly apply the lessons learned.","Lesson ID":1182}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The primary cause of the mishap was failure to follow the procedural instructions in PR number PV-6-140247, in which: (1) facility water technicians added a flow test on the Zone 3 system after valve diaphragm repair, and (2) in not fully closing or in improperly reopening the manual riser isolation valve, water was allowed to flow into Zone 3 of the OPF Bay 2 water deluge system. Contributing causes included the following: The OPF GSE technicians, who are members of the \"Contingency Team,\" had not been adequately trained in the operation of the OPF water deluge system. This led to the OPF GSE \"Contingency Team\" technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system, while thinking they were turning the system off. A thorough pre-task briefing (PTB) was not held for the water deluge system valve repair task, which could have prevented deviation from the repair procedure by the facility water technicians. The labeling on the remote manual arming and firing valve activation station of the OPF water deluge system was misinterpreted. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system when they believed they were turning the system off. The remote manual arming and firing valves are in the \"on\" position when perpendicular to the water lines, which is not the industry norm for hydraulic systems. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians believing they were closing the valves by positioning them perpendicular to the water line when, in fact, they were opening the valves. This human factor problem was not addressed in the System Assurance Analysis for the Water System at the OPF, SAA09FY09-007, Revision B, dated July 1987. The manual arming and firing valves behind the OPF are easily accessed by simply opening the individual valve box doors, which destroys the paper integrity seals. Essentially, there was no physical barrier to the valves. Even though redundancy exists for the Viking valves in the deluge system, these valves are open when no dome pressure is applied. Failures which remove dome pressure could result in the flow of water. There are significant configuration differences between the OPF Bay 1 and 2 water deluge systems. The OPF Bay 1 configuration does not include the manual riser isolation valve. Engineering Order E084-79KO5423, which installs the manual riser isolation valve for both bay configurations, has not yet been accomplished for Bay 1. This should be implemented for Bay 1 after OV-103 rollout for STS-33 and prior to another Orbiter occupying Bay 1. There are only 6 boxes for the manual arming and firing valves in the Bay 1 configuration, with the arming and firing valves for a particular zone in the same box. The Bay 2 configuration has 12 boxes, one for each valve. Signs on the boxes are not uniform between OPF Bays 1 and 2. The NASA Test Director (NTD) evacuated OPF Bay 2 via a public address announcement. He could not use the area warning system because OPF Bay 1 would have also been evacuated, which was not required. As a result of the inadvertent activation of the firex deluge system, Orbiter GSE was damaged (i.e., the Mechanical Control Interface Unit for the Remote Manipulating Arm and the Cargo Verification Unit). No redundancy is available for the Mechanical Control Interface Unit. The OPF Bay 2 evacuation during this incident was in accordance with established procedures. Security control of Bay 2 was properly maintained. All personnel and emergency service actions were professional and properly carried out.","Lesson ID":1183}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The use of microstrip patch elements was a new design to BSS, and as such, received substantial attention during the design, development and test phase. However, the interrelated physics of the sunshield contact and performance shortfall were never fully understood. Designers assumed that the designed spacing between the elements and the sunshield would be achieved. (The designed spacing of approximately 1\/2 inch is more than sufficient to eliminate the effect.) Designers of the sunshield mechanical retention were unaware of the electrostatic attraction force and assumed that the sunshield would maintain clearance in the zero gravity space environment. While formed beam (gain and axial ratio) tests were performed on the assembled MA array without the sunshield in flight configuration, and continuity tests were performed on each element after installation of the sunshield, there was no test designed to compare individual element gain and axial ratio performance between pre and post installation of the sunshield. During the anomaly investigation, laboratory tests of elements with the sunshield \"touching\" the elements yielded no significant effect. This was a false conclusion based on a test configuration that pulled the sunshield away from the element due to gravity.","Lesson ID":1180}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The primary cause of the pressurized steam line incident was that no one took responsibility for coordinating all aspects of executing the outage. Each group involved in the outage focused on what they believed to be their role and did not concern themselves with what the other groups were doing. Consequently, issues that required a coordinated effort such as blowing down the de-energized lines or informing the contractor when it was safe to commence work were not adequately addressed. The MIB believes that if one person\/organization had coordinated the entire job, the contractors would not have started jack-hammering before the steam line was de-energized. A second primary cause of this incident is that is that no procedures exist for shutting down the north High Pressure Steam (HPS) line in the CPP and no prior planning occurred. Workers had to trace the steam line the day of the outage to determine what valves to close. Their efforts were hindered by such contributing causes as unlabeled valves, no visual pressure indicators on the line, inadequate access to the valves and a leaking valve. This resulted in the line not being completely de-energized until after the contractors had completed their shift for the day. Corrective Action Plans from past mishap investigations must be implemented in a timely manner and the actions sustained over time. No clearly identified leader to coordinate all aspects of a task involving multiple organizations can result in a failure to communicate safety-critical information that could prevent a mishap. Such tasks should have a clearly identified leader who has the responsibility of coordinating all aspects of the job and communicating safety-critical information to all personnel involved in the task. Outdated or inaccurate facility drawings\/documentation and poor labeling of a facility such as the CPP increases the difficulty of accomplishing tasks of all levels of complexity and therefore increases the likelihood of errors and mistakes that could result in a mishap. Accurate and up-to-date drawings\/documentation and clear labeling of such facilities on the other hand, assist workers in understanding the detailed design and operations of the facilities and therefore minimize the likelihood or errors and mistakes. Division safety guidance documents should be reviewed periodically and updated to reflect changes in NASA\/GSFC safety policies, organizational structure or evolved ways of doing business.","Lesson ID":1084}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The primary cause of the electrical manhole incident is an error in judgment made by the attendant that left the workers in the manhole unattended. The Mishap Investigation Board (MIB) identified two contributing causes. Testimony indicated that non-adherence to the Code 220 confined space guidelines was the norm in this organization at the time of this incident. This mode of operation was either condoned by or unknown to management. All workers involved in the incident had received some confined space training; however records indicated that it was not complete or recent. The attendant had not received training while a GSFC employee. The MIB believes that inadequate training contributed to the relaxed attitude of employees towards adherence to the confined space entry guidelines, which in turn contributed to the attendant's decision. A lax attitude towards safety has a cumulative effect: Lapses in OSHA-required training leads to non-adherence to important safety-related practices and to employees that do not have safety upper most in their minds. New employees get the impression that safety is not all that important. Lapses in adhering to safety requirements and\/or enforcement of adhering to safety requirements leads to the perception that the rules are not based on a real need to prevent mishaps (i,.e., we never follow the rules and nothing bad happens). Eventually, these lapses will result in a mishap.","Lesson ID":1085}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Review Committee concluded that the primary cause for this incident was that the Range Safety abort was rescinded without on net authority and range awareness. The principal contributing factors to this incident were the off net communications; and confusion that resulted from having two separate operational nets, the lack of sufficiently detailed and attended prelaunch briefings, and the lengthy process of communicating with the B-52. The Review Committee during its investigation has compiled a list of findings and conclusions. They have been grouped in the following categories: Abort Process Mission Rules Communications Launch Day Roles and Responsibilities Mission Planning and Preparation ABORT PROCESS FINDINGS An abort was initiated by the WFF\/RSO, the abort was rescinded by the contractor TC without on net authority and range awareness. The B-52 was required to reduce altitude just prior to the CDR dropout abort call. WFF, Eastern Range (ER), Merritt Island Tracking Station (MILA) and Bermuda Tracking Station (BDA) responded in a manner which allowed continued flight of the Pegasus after launch There was no procedure in the WFF\/OSD or the Contractor Launch Checklist (LC) that detailed the procedure for rescinding an abort. CONCLUSIONS From the above findings, the Committee reached the following conclusions: The contractor TC method of rescinding the abort was inadequate. Fin battery actuation was a consideration in the decision to rescind the abort. The altitude problem may have contributed to the confusion concerning the abort. Capability to destruct the Pegasus was maintained throughout the flight. Quick positive reaction by all supporting personnel allowed this flight to continue to a successful conclusion. MISSION RULES FINDINGS An apparent dropout of a Flight Termination System (FTS) CDR occurred. This apparent dropout required an abort of the launch according to the mission rules. Not all key personnel were aware of all mission rules. Additionally, in some cases, key personnel had different interpretations of mission rules. CONCLUSIONS There were misunderstandings among key personnel concerning the mission rules. Lack of awareness and misinterpretation of mission rules may have contributed to this incident. The FTS CDR dropout mission rule produced a high risk of mission abort. The complex routing of the data stream (vehicle\/aircraft to ground, ground to Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) satellite, satellite to ground) and the amount of support equipment necessary to provide this data (decoms, bit syncs, cabling) produced a high probability of data loss not related to CDR health. COMMUNICATIONS FINDINGS No single Intercom Channel (IC) was understood by all key participants as the primary launch net. The WFF\/RSO chain of communication to the B-52 required 3 intermediaries. The configuration of communication equipment used by NASA 1 and the contractor TC was operationally awkward. Formal intercom net protocol was not consistently used. CONCLUSIONS The lack of a single IC for all critical calls that was monitored by all key personnel contributed to confusion and to the range's lack of knowledge of impending launch. The chain of communication between the WFF\/RSO and the B-52 contained too many elements. Improved intercom net discipline may have prevented misunderstandings leading to the unplanned launch. The contractor TC had expected to receive Range abort calls from the WFF\/RCO on IC 4. The fact that the abort was only transmitted on IC 1 by the WFF\/TD and heard off net by the contractor TC caused the contractor TC to question the abort call and delayed the passing of the abort to the B-52. LAUNCH DAY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FINDINGS There were no clear lines of authority and responsibility for launch decisions. The OSC\/TC rescinded the abort command without proper on net authority and range awareness. CONCLUSIONS The primary cause of this incident was that the OSC\/TC rescinded the abort without on net authority and range awareness. The lack of clear lines of authority and responsibility contributed to his\/her actions. The limited abort scenarios exercised during the dress rehearsal were not sufficient to identify all authority and responsibility conflicts. MISSION PLANNING AND PREPARATION FINDINGS No pre-launch briefing was held at which all key participants reviewed mission rules, constraints, and procedures. The WFF\/Operations and Safety Directive (OSD) and the Contractor's Launch Operations and Mission Constraints (LOMC) document contained conflicting information that was not completely integrated in the mission planning process. A complete dress rehearsal was not conducted for this mission. CONCLUSIONS The pre-mission planning and preparation process was inadequate for a mission of the scope and complexity of the Pegasus \/ SCD-1 launch. Conflicting Information in the various organizations' documentation may have contributed to this incident. The lack of a pre-mission briefing attended by all organizations that reviewed roles, responsibilities, mission rules\/constraints, IC assignments, and the launch decision process contributed to this incident.","Lesson ID":1090}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Root Cause of Problem: The T\/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX\/POSEIDON configuration. Contributing Factors: A stability analysis of the total lifted assembly that was used in the T\/V lift was not performed. The lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook were not adequately applied. A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T\/V handling fixture assembly, was repeatedly postponed, and not held prior to its use for lifting the spacecraft into the T\/V chamber. Additional Observations: The overall review process, at all levels (peer review to formal review) failed to identify the lifting fixture deficiency. No precursor run through (dry run) of the T\/V lifting exercise, using either the actual or a high fidelity simulation of the lifted assembly, was run prior to the lift with the flight spacecraft. There was a low fidelity dry run with the TOPEX\/POSEIDON handling fixture, but it was performed without a spacecraft mass simulation and at different locations and orientations than the flight spacecraft handling. (The stated purpose for the dry run was to check the SHSS and thermal shroud interfaces and clearances to the T\/V chamber, not to dry run the actual spacecraft lift.) Just prior to the final crane move, the T\/V Fixture Assembly was lifted by the crane and a \"rocking test\" was performed on the assembly by the test team to assess its stability. The T\/V Fixture Assembly appeared to be stable at that time because the lifting clevis friction was not exceeded during the rocking test. Lessons Learned: GSE Review - Ground support handling equipment should always be reviewed\/approved by experienced designers and handling personnel prior to handling operations. Review material - Released drawings, analysis, and procedures for handling equipment should be available for review at least 60 days before a test to permit adequate evaluation. Lifting Equipment Stability Analysis - No lifting equipment should ever be used without a complete stability analysis of the equipment with the load in its complete configuration. Precursor Handling Experience - On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur. Project overview of contract - Project support from the cognizant JPL (or other NASA Center) divisions should ensure, for the area of overview of their organization, that the contractor is adhering to all applicable requirements. All contractual documents (such as JPL 900-501) relating to potentially hazardous operations should be clearly identified and should receive special attention. Dedicated Briefing - A detailed and dedicated briefing structured to review the wording, text, diagrams, etc. is also a mandatory part of any functional demonstration. This briefing serves to inform the personnel who may not have had the opportunity to read or review the written material or see the diagrams, etc. More importantly it is an opportunity for anyone who does not understand his assignment to have a clarification. If there are any reservations with regard to the technical approach of the upcoming activity this forum is the place to discuss them. Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration of all critical lifts, handling or maneuvers should be performed just prior to any event involving flight hardware. It may be judged too costly or redundant to a detailed procedure, but the value of such an exercise is particularly worthwhile if a high value item such as a one of a kind spacecraft is involved. The actual demonstration (dry run), will reveal discrepancies in the written procedure. When the procedure lacks detail, the demonstration affords the opportunity to try out, or practice, different variations to the step-by-step approach. The unwritten or unspoken, yet implied instruction must be practiced and executed by the actual personnel involved. Where coordinated actions are required the exercise will help assure that everyone has the same response and timing to obtain the same end result. An exact physical and mass mock up would be an ideal item to use for the demonstration, but it is rarely a possibility because of resource or other limitations. The importance of the duplication of the center of gravity with a mass mock up is self evident. The interface points or pickup points of the load can usually be replicated or borrowed from the flight article. However, in no case should they be overloaded or mispositioned from the designated lifting pattern. All shackles, rings, slings, chains, and everything in the load line should be assembled from a sketch or a pictorial equivalent in the procedure which identifies each item as to capacity, size or other details. All parts should carry a dated tag stating the level of proof load sustained, and witnessed by the appropriate project official. Loadlines should not be torn down after a proof or demonstration load test to the levels and conditions stated in the procedure. If a partial tear down is required, the exact reassembly must be assured. This is particularly important with multiple joint assemblies using what appears to be identical hardware, but may have different loadings. Clevis pins must never be mixed from assembly to assembly. One final note on the load line drawings. It has been shown on numerous occasions that the facility does not fit the load line or vice versa even though everyone's opinion was to the contrary. It is prudent to include key dimensions on the load line sketch for later use. Tilt Angle Requirements - Although it did not contribute to the TOPEX overturning incident, the yielding of the spreader bar at a tilt angle of only 8 degrees to 10 degrees raises an important point. Historically, there has been no design requirement for lifting equipment to tolerate a specified tilt angle. Lifting equipment requirements should be revised so the usual safety factors must be met at a specified, tilt angle. Host Center Review of Hazardous Procedures - Host center personnel should perform a review of all hazardous procedures\/operations planned by outside user organizations. In addition, development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered. Video Recording of Hazardous Operations - All hazardous operations should be video recorded. The video recording of the overturning anomaly and the preceding and following activities was extremely helpful in the investigation and evaluation of this incident. Since mishaps may also occur during normal operations, consideration should be given to video recording all operations involving unique high value equipment. Use of inexpensive, off-the-shelf video cameras and recorders would permit very economical routine video recording of all activities The TOPEX\/POSEIDON overturning incident had the potential for being classified as a NASA Type A Mishap. Only a series of uncontrolled, but fortunate occurrences prevented this from initially being a much more serious anomaly with severe consequences. Major damage to both the spacecraft and the T\/V chamber were avoided only because the T\/V Fixture Assembly was lifted higher than necessary to clear the lip of the chamber. This was done in the erroneous belief that the higher lift (shorter crane to assembly distance) would improve stability by reducing swaying of the load. If the lift had been at the same height as the dry run, the T\/V Fixture Assembly might have struck the chamber lip during the rollover resulting in major damage to both the Spacecraft and the chamber. The H-Frame spreader bar was severely damaged, and probably would have failed completely if one of the suspension cables had not snagged on one of the upper SHSS clevis lugs. Complete failure of the spreader bar would have dropped the 8000 pound load approximately equal to 40 feet to the floor of the T\/V chamber, destroying both the Spacecraft and the chamber. The Spacecraft fortuitously rolled with the -X side down, where a significant amount of GSE structure was mounted. If the Spacecraft had rotated with the +X side down (or if it had fully inverted) placing it on the floor of the T\/V chamber to relieve the loads on the H-Frame spreader bar might not have been possible without significant additional damage to the spacecraft. Following the anomaly only the quick and professional response of the test team and contractor personnel prevented further (and potentially severe) damage to the Spacecraft and chamber facility.","Lesson ID":1089}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The risk involved between using in-house hardware manufacturing shops and commercial vendors should be weighed carefully. For several reasons including attrition and Center priorities, In-house capabilities may lack the experience and resources to meet Project requirements. However, their proximity and familiarity with NASA missions may overcome this. On the other hand, while a commercial vendor may appear to have both the experience and resources to meet Project requirements, they actually may have less capability than their NASA in-house counterparts to devote to the Project due to their non-Project commitments.","Lesson ID":1093}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The criticality of understanding unique PTFE properties that derive from subtle resin differences can not be underestimated. Additional tests must be performed to distinguish between candidate resins, and to ensure that required properties not covered by available specifications are met. Materials selection criteria must be constantly re-evaluated to ensure that all key properties are addressed in new applications. Proper resin selection also was found to partially compensate for an unoptimized seal design. Given the nature of the hot-forming assembly process used, the material with the highest resistance to compressive fracturing should have been chosen initially. Switching from a free-flowing extrusion grade to a nonfree-flowing compression-molding grade of PTFE allowed fabrication of viable seals suitable for valve level testing.","Lesson ID":1039}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"All operations and modifications to flight hardware and its interfacing GSE should always have comprehensive and well reviewed written procedures. Schedule pressure can cause even top performers to make mistakes and\/or take short cuts. Gas K-bottles or other sources of gases should be readily identifiable in safety critical and contamination critical programs. Gases should be positively verified in safety critical and contamination critical programs. Gases should be segregated by species. Controls should be in place to avoid inadvertently placing a different gas in a rack or storage location designated for another species of gas. All personnel supervising or writing procedures for transportation activities should be trained on DOT HAZMAT regulations. In addition to the need for a positive identification of gases, the traceability and accountability must be maintained to ensure that no changes have occurred. Lessons learned should be widely disseminated and appropriate follow-through on appropriate actions from the lessons must occur. It is important to maintain configuration control on GSE that interfaces with flight hardware and diligently verify its configuration and functions, especially if repairs or modifications are being incorporated. A single integrated procedure should be used when multiple simultaneous operations are occurring in order to establish clear lines of authority. Ensure safety and minimize distractions and concerns of the participants. Contamination plans and control should be thorough and consider all sources of contamination including using the incorrect materials and gases. MIPs should be utilized to ensure success in executing the procedures and not be viewed as hindrances to completing the tasks.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When focusing on fixing one hardware problem, be careful to identify and eliminate other hardware problems which may be created by the change. Additionally, be careful to fully test every hardware change to qualify the system and ensure something has not been missed. In this scenario, new hardware was used to eliminate a known hazard but it introduced other unanticipated risks. Changing from the previous high blow-by valve to a new low blow-by valve did mitigate the risk of a pyrotechnically induced propellant explosion upon ignition. However, an increased operational reliability risk was introduced because the new valve did not have an extensive operational history. The risks were initially missed, but were ultimately identified through thorough testing and necessary modifications were made.","Lesson ID":1035}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Without careful consideration, 'minor' design changes to hardware and associated assembly\/test fixtures (for example, material specifications, dimensional tolerances, surface finishes, assembly process variables, etc.) can greatly affect conclusions drawn from the prototype test data and even invalidate the entire prototype effort. Prototype hardware was built as a proof-of-concept and therefore was not flight representative. This approach used existing parts and yielded encouraging initial results, but the reduced level of design rigor contributed to the difficulties in subsequent fabrication. In this regard, prototyping failed to reveal subtleties in critical design features and fabrication parameters that were unique to the build-up of a flight-configuration hardware.","Lesson ID":1036}

Very early in the Formulation phase, define: (1) the funding profile, (2) the date the launch vehicle is needed, (3) the Level 1 requirements and success criteria, (4) the reserves strategy and (5) the partnering approach. Do not proceed with further commitments until an agreement has been reached with NASA. Also very early in the Formulation phase, define the use of new technology and its readiness, and backups for risk mitigation. Create a project team environment that forces problems to be addressed immediately as they are identified. The extensive JPL technical resources should be utilized to assist in early problem resolution. Challenge every quotnewquot or quotcreepingquot requirement. Rigorous technical evaluations of potential industrial partners must be completed. Provide adequate early funding for the chosen partner.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"By nature of their construction, tantalum capacitors (both wet slug and dry slug styles) are polar devices that are susceptible to performance degradation and\/or catastrophic failure if reverse biased. This behavioral characteristic has always been known, but recent experiences have reminded us of the importance of proper installation and circuit design when using this type of component. Historically, reverse polarity failures have been observed that resulted from: Incorrect initial installation (part installed backwards) Incorrect installation during rework (original part installed correctly, but replacement part put in backwards) Correct circuit design, but incorrect artwork on the printed wiring board (part installed correctly according to the artwork, but actually in backwards) Incorrect circuit design (printed wiring board artwork correct per circuit layout, but design error resulted in parts in backwards) The NASA EEE Parts Assurance Group (NEPAG) is currently investigating the reverse polarity behavior of tantalum dry slug chip capacitors because there is little definitive information in the literature on this subject. Preliminary results will be available in the last quarter of 2001. Guidelines Regarding Reverse Bias Application of Tantalum Capacitors Wet Slug (Non-Solid) Tantalum Capacitors Ex.- MIL-PRF-39006 CLR79, CLR81, CLR90 and CLR91 types Capable of handling up to 3 volts of reverse polarity regardless of capacitor voltage rating. Leakage current characteristics will be higher than normal. Exceeding 3 volts reverse bias will cause rapid deterioration of the capacitor leading to catastrophic failure (short circuit) Polarity identification is generally indicated by a \"+\" or a stripe on the anode termination. Also, hermetically sealed, tubular case, wet slug styles have a crimp towards one end of the case that may be used to identify the anode (\"+\") end. Exceptions or variations to these conventions may exist. Dry Slug (Solid) Tantalum Capacitors Ex. MIL-PRF-39003 and MIL-PRF-55365 CSR, CSS and CWR types Sensitive to reverse polarity but tend to be much less so than their wet slug counterparts. May fail explosively under reverse bias, even catch fire. May survive \"indefinitely\" at room temperature with up to 15% of their voltage rating applied in reverse. Capacitors will have a higher leakage current than in the forward direction, but this may be undetectable in the majority of heavily derated circuit applications. The circuit may operate properly for many hours (hundreds or even thousands) before failure. Influential factors in life expectancy are believed to include: manufacturer, style, size, capacitance, moisture content and of course rated voltage. \"Chip\" styles may be more vulnerable to failure under reverse bias than hermetically sealed styles because moisture may accelerate failure. NEPAG is investigating the effect of moisture. \"Chip\" styles are more prone to being installed improperly because they may be very small and the polarity identifier can be hard to see. Conformally coated \"chip\" styles (ex.--CWR06) typically identify the polarity by a small projection \"nub\" in the center of one termination representing the anode (+) termination Molded case \"chip\" styles (ex.--CWR09 and CWR11) identify the polarity by a beveled edge in the case and\/or a polarity bar marked on the case Polarity identification is generally indicated by a \"+\" or a stripe adjacent to the anode termination. Exceptions or variations to these conventions may exist. One example of such an exception is the tubular case capacitor made in accordance with MIL-PRF-39003\/10 which requires a stripe to identify the cathode \"-\" termination","Lesson ID":981}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The approach which the Project undertook was to develop simulators which electrically duplicated the spacecraft side of the interface. These simulators were then shipped to the instruments on a rotating basis. Tests were performed with instrument engineering model hardware and the flight instruments as well. These tests were performed on the flight instruments, after the flight instrument was assembled, but before the lengthy environmental and calibration test phases which complex instruments demand. This gave the instrument developers the confidence that their instrument would be compatible with the spacecraft, when the time came to integrate into the spacecraft. In doing this, it avoided the possibility of having to make a significant instrument modification, as a result of an interface incompatibility, after the instrument had been delivered. This in turn could have resulted in the need for additional regression testing (T\/V, EMI\/EMC) and the attendant schedule impact. In addition to the benefits of isolating design or workmanship errors in the instrument's spacecraft interface early, it provided an early opportunity for the instrument teams to work in the environment that they would be seeing, after they delivered their instrument to the spacecraft facility. Command and telemetry databases were hosted on the spacecraft interface simulator, and building block procedures, which were to be executed later at spacecraft level, could be debugged at this early opportunity prior to instrument delivery. The planning and information interchange necessitated by the use of this interface simulator hardware caused spacecraft and instrument teams to become cognizant of integration and test issues much sooner than they likely would have. This led to a Terra instrument integration activity which was virtually trouble free. The spacecraft interface simulators deployed during the instrument integration and test phases played an enormous role in the eventual ease of instrument integration. The Terra experience is a strong endorsement for the use of spacecraft simulators at the instrument developers' facility during instrument integration and test. This is particularly true when significant development risk resides on both sides of the interface and the complexity of the instruments is such that a significant amount of time is invested during the instrument environmental test flow.","Lesson ID":980}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Recently, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has observed that many hardware builders repackage EEE parts during receiving inspection and discard the part manufacturer's original shipping containers. This practice can lead to loss of vital lot traceability information because in many cases, the shipping containers contain unique lot information that may not be provided by the part markings or other shipping documentation (Certificates of Compliance, etc.) that is typically retained by the user. This problem may also occur if the user discards the paperwork and\/or packaging when all the parts in the package have been used. Accurate and detailed EEE part lot traceability information may be critical in order to perform risk assessments, circuit performance analysis and failure investigations especially when problems are reported for parts that may already be assembled into hardware or when troubleshooting on-orbit anomalies. The EEE part manufacturer generally establishes lot traceability through a combination of the manufacturer's part number, CAGE code and a unique production Lot Date Code (LDC). Generally speaking, the production LDC identifies a group of parts of the same style and ratings that are manufactured from the same raw material lots and are processed through all critical manufacturing steps and tests as a single group. As such, the production LDC is an invaluable lot identifier. Unfortunately, this production LDC is generally NOT marked directly on the parts (especially for smaller chip style components where there may be insufficient room for any part markings) and is sometimes only provided to the user on labels affixed to the original shipping containers for the parts (i.e., C of C may not contain production LDC info). It is important to note that a production LDC is not the same as the inspection LDC (or marking LDC) which is commonly marked directly on the part and shipping documentation. (For MIL specification products, the LDC marked on the parts is the inspection LDC). The inspection LDC generally represents the year and week when a group of parts is subjected to the manufacturer's final test and inspection (end of production test). It is very probable for a manufacturer to submit many different production lots of the same part type to final inspection during the same week. As such, each inspection lot may be me made up of multiple production lots. When a problem is later discovered that is attributed to a specific production lot, the user may not be able to effectively assess risk if the only traceability data they have on file is the inspection LDC. Figure 1 helps to illustrate a recent example where disposal of the manufacturer's original shipping containers resulted in loss of effective lot traceability. This figure shows the original shipping container of one tantalum chip capacitor manufacturer. A label affixed to the container by the manufacturer provides vital lot traceability information including procurement part number, manufacturer part number, CAGE Code, production LDC and inspection LDC. The other shipping documentation that accompanied this manufacturer's shipment did NOT contain the production LDC. Different users of this manufacturer's parts discarded this container (and label) after performing receiving inspection or stocking or kitting the parts. When problems with this manufacturer's parts were later reported, having only part number and inspection LDC (from part markings and C of C) made traceability back to the manufacturer's original production traveler information exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, valuable lot pedigree information could not be obtained to assist in the risk assessment process. [D]","Lesson ID":982}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Several weeks of investigation proceeded, and a significant amount of analysis and modeling were performed. It was determined that the impingement of the thruster plumes from two of the attitude thrusters were producing a large torque, by impinging on the Terra solar array. The Terra solar array is a very large flexible blanket type array. The location of the array during the maneuver resulted in the worse possible orientation for plume interaction, and it also resulted in the largest possible moment arm between the center-of-pressure and center-of-gravity. The combination of these two factors resulted in the larger than expected disturbance torque, which led to the attitude disturbance and the shutdown of the orbit raising maneuver. Subsequent to numerous analyses and simulations, an optimal orientation for the solar array during the maneuvers was determined, and a modified thruster torque transformation matrix were developed. The torque transformation matrix accounted for the residual disturbance which was still induced, even with the solar array in the optmized orientation. A series of smaller orbit raising maneuvers were performed to verify the software changes. The maneuvers executed without problems. Long duration maneuvers were then performed. These maneuvers were likewise successful. Terra reached its operational orbit and began flying in formation with Landsat 7 in February 2000. Upon reviewing the process on why this error was not detected before launch, it was determined that no direct modeling of the plume impingement phenomena was ever performed. Plume effects were accounted for via a design allocation process; however, the torque that was allocated in the design process was inadequate. The allocation was not verified via a closed-loop simulation simulation. This experience reaffirms the value of performing high fidelity 3-axis simulations prior to launch. This is particularly true as spacecraft grow, and surface areas become larger. The utility of high fidelity 3-axis simulations is unquestionable, and should be performed as a routine and continuous part of the spacecraft design process.","Lesson ID":979}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Terra development schedule had always planned to perform end-to-end testing between the spacecraft and the EOS control center as soon as the ground system was capable of such testing. The initial test between the satellite and the ground system was in fact conducted while the spacecraft was in spacecraft-level thermal\/vacuum test. The Terra housekeeping command and control links were exercised, just prior to completion of the Terra thermal\/vacuum test. Due to unforeseen problems in the launch vehicle and the ground system, this initial test would prove to be almost two years before the launch of Terra. When the decision was made to change the implementation of the Terra ground system, due to the fact that a number of technical problems were not reaching resolution, the resolve to execute rigorous end-to-end testing became even more critical. A decision was made in the fall of 1998 to incorporate a new control center software package. The software was planned for completion in the spring, with the launch of Terra scheduled for the summer. Schedule pressures could have forced a lesser amount of allocated time for end-to-end testing, however the Project adopted the philosophy that no rigor be compromised, and a comprehensive test flow was adopted. Where early testing was possible with preliminary deliveries of the ground software, the philosophy was to always regression test when a subsequent software delivery became available. The spacecraft and ground teams performed tremendously in spite of difficult and challenging circumstances. Both S-band and Ku-band tests were executed, using the NASA Compatibility Test Van (CTV) which had been shipped to the launch site for this very purpose. The early orbit mission activities were tested and retested, validating the hardware, software, and perhaps most importantly the people. The lesson learned from the success of Terra's early communications success, is that there is no substitute for real life end-to-end testing. In Terra's unique circumstances, it placed a tremendous demand on the spacecraft and ground systems personnel who had to complete the software development, launch preparations and end-to-end testing on a compressed schedule. All who were involved with Terra will agree that there should be no compromise when it comes to such critical tests between the flight and ground segments.","Lesson ID":978}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Early on in the investigation there was much concern regarding the lack of damage to the FPB faceplate. Past failures in the FPB injector and OPB injector suggested that faceplate damage was common for fuel flow loss due to contamination. Model analysis performed during this investigation suggests that with a short-duration test and with the fuel cavity contamination type and quantity observed, damage to the FPB faceplate does not necessarily occur. In other words, there exists a substantial range of contamination levels within which it is possible to effectively destroy the HPFTP without melting the FPB faceplate.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Lessons Learned\/Recommendations: While environmental testing has demonstrated considerable value to spaceflight projects, such testing always carries inherent risks. Test facilities must be maintained, and over time replaced as necessary, such that the test equipment is in good working order. Metrics must be developed and tracked that assess the mechanical health of the systems. \"Canned\" tests should be developed and periodically utilized to provide a trended database for the test facility system response. Any deviations in the system response should be investigated. Critical control system response data, such as the transfer function or inverse transfer functions and calculated drive voltage, must be evaluated real-time during vibration testing, but before application of the sine-burst to ensure that they are reasonable and do not indicate system maladies. A vibration facility validation test should be done for each planned test series that is representative of the actual test conditions before flight or critical hardware is mounted. Use of a simulated mass consistent with that of the test article is always recommended for spacecraft system level testing. Other flight equipment validation testing should be considered based on mass and criticality. Self-checks should be done that provide a representative response for the forcing range of the planned test. For higher force shock tests, shaker systems and test fixtures often do not respond in a linear fashion. It is also foolhardy to assume that test facilities are always in perfect working order. All test requirements should be defined in the test plan for a particular test. The test operators must have adequate data and training to ensure complete verification testing before testing critical hardware.","Lesson ID":903}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The key lesson here is not a new one. Ground testing should be done in the same configuration in which you will fly. The normal on-orbit operating mode for AMSU-B is scanning. However, during much of the spacecraft level EMI\/EMC testing on the NOAA-K spacecraft, the AMSU-B instrument was tested in a non-scanning mode due to a ground test, antenna bearing operating time restriction. Even though there were restrictions on the ground operating time of the instrument in the scan mode, more time could have been allocated for EMI\/EMC system level testing. It is important to test all flight hardware in as near flight conditions as possible to avoid on-orbit surprises. The second lesson here is to carefully and thoroughly review all of your test data. In reviewing the spacecraft level EMI\/EMC data again after the flight anomaly was noted, it was discovered that during the times the instrument was scanning, interference was visible in the data. The instrument was also tested by itself before delivery to the spacecraft and interference should have been detected there also. The third lesson is that in the design of space flight hardware, care must be taken to assure that whenever possible, hardware can be adequately tested on the ground before launch. In the case of AMSU-B, the manufacturer of the instrument was concerned that bearing lubricant would degrade through oxidation while operating at ambient pressure. They therefore imposed a ground test operating time limit on the instrument. Other lubricants and\/or designs were available that would have eliminated this constraint.","Lesson ID":906}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"NASA has an exemption on these cylinders to authorize their transportation, even though they were constructed with material not currently on the material list in the code of regulations and for how they were acceptance tested. These cylinders are just as safe as the general regulation's intent, but allow variances to the general regulation. Exemptions are quite often how new containers enter into the transportation codes. These DOT exemptions may have transportation mode restrictions. When shipping a cylinder with a DOT exemption number on the side of the cylinder, shipping department personnel must recognize the need to review the terms of the exemption before shipping the cylinder. Shipping department personnel may not have copies of the exemption or may not be familiar enough with the code to recognize that they need a copy of the exemption.","Lesson ID":902}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Spacecraft hardware and test articles used for public display must be thoroughly scrutinized for hazards prior to release to the public. The Lunar Module test article had been stored safely without incident for over 25 years. Personnel should resist the temptation to become complacent with items that are assumed to be safe. Toxic vapor checks of large systems may not indicate the complete status of a contaminated system. Artifacts previously contaminated with a hazardous substance must be fully decontaminated prior to release to the public. This includes flushing of all portions of the system as well as removal of all softgoods. Museum personnel must be fully informed of potential hazards.","Lesson ID":887}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Due to the risky nature of the advanced technologies to be flight-validated, we determined that our traditional project organization was not well suited to deal with this new kind of mission. More specifically, we identified the following shortfalls in our organization: We needed someone with insight into these new technologies who could devote all of their time to managing their maturation to flight status and to define the best way to validate them once on orbit. We needed additional help for the Mission Systems Engineer to devise a system and subsystem architectures to minimize the interaction between the advanced technologies and thereby maximize the likelihood of flight-validating them while remaining within the mission cost cap. We needed risk management well beyond what we would expect for a small science mission.","Lesson ID":888}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Inadequate means for communication during towing can lead to damage to aircraft. Pre-briefing wilth all tow personnel prior to each tow will assist in planning each tow and avoiding potential towing incidents. For this incident, a pre-briefing would have brought to everyone's attention that the scaffolding had been moved off-center and that potential collision with the scaffolding would be likely. Painting of a new alignment centerline would have likely avoided collision of the aircraft with the scaffolding.","Lesson ID":884}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"It is necessary to confirm that developmental and flight hardware is in a configuration that has been reviewed for hardware and personnel safety prior to beginning any test sequence. Real and potential structural interferences should be mapped and documented for all deployable\/articulated components on the spacecraft. This should be done for all spacecraft test and operational configurations.","Lesson ID":885}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The ceramic bed heater is especially vulnerable to excess differential pressure across the bed. Location of the lower pressure port created a single point failure that allowed the differential pressure to develop uncontrolled. Steps which could have been taken to prevent this mishap from occurring could have been more rigorous reviews, identifying the pressure ports in the vessel as safety critical features, listing them as such on the fabrication drawings and in failure modes analyses, and assuring that inspection during construction was accomplished. Formal configuration management should commence immediately following design completion. This configuration management may be tailored to the size and scope of the project. In cases of contracting for hardware or software systems, NASA should participate in or thoroughly audit the Contractors systems to assure adequate configuration controls. The Systems Engineering process, functioning in a project to define and understand all system interfaces, is extremely important. It is even more important for rehabilitation type projects where interfaces between the old and the new systems can become critical. The Trial Run approach of IST for establishing differential pressure settings for safety limits offered no provision for detecting system faults such as the incorrectly located pressure port. It could only have succeeded with a correctly functioning system. The test plan should have provided predicted (calculated) values of differential pressure across the orificed grate as a function of header pressure and valve position. Lines of authority and responsibility must be defined and functioning for a safe and successful ISH process. Project responsibility should extend through the IST process and until the facility is recertified operational and returned to the operating organization. With known high incidence of errors in developmental software, a methodology should be implemented for simulation modeling of systems for software testing prior to putting research facilities at risk. Commercial software systems are available for these purposes. Real time recording and storage of run data for review and diagnostic use is very important whenever attempting the final validation of a control system and its associated software. It is extremely important when using actual system hardware to support the validation process. The more dynamic the system's response to input, the greater the consequences of control system failure. Investigation of unexpected behavior of high energy or otherwise potentially dangerous systems should include support analyses or other positive causal verification which cannot result in detriment to the system, before proceeding with full system operation.","Lesson ID":862}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Government and industry need to increase their efforts to educate and heighten the awareness of users regarding the lethality of nitrogen and other inert gases and the rapid onset of asphyxia when these gases are inspired. New safety provision and requirements should be documented in existing organizational safety plans required by AHB 1700-1. It is the responsibility of management to insure awareness of these plans with periodic safety review staff meetings for both Government and contract personnel. Consideration should be given to amplification of management responsibility for dealing with emergencies and mishaps, and to dissemination of this information by means of an appropriate memorandum to all management at reasonable intervals. NASA should require training and\/or certification procedures for personnel working with inert gases under circumstances such that they can become asphyxiants. Thorough training and checkout should be given to all new personal equipment technicians in the High Altitude Missions Branch notwithstanding their previous knowledge of and experience with the equipment. The nitrogen regulator and outlet to the portable testing kit in the personal equipment maintenance room should be placarded. A warning placard near or over any testing console or workbench utilizing nitrogen or other inert gas should make reference to the hazards of asphyxia. Consideration should be given to the use of breathing air instead of nitrogen as the gas supply for personal equipment testing in this facility. A number of contractor and\/or NASA personnel in the High Altitude Missions Branch should receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. At this time, the nearest CPR-trained staff members are in Building 240A, too far away to be of much help in the event of a serious problem in Building 240.","Lesson ID":866}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The underground casings of the UASF have experienced anodic corrosion at their exterior surface resulting in a loss of wall thickness of up to 50 percent with localized areas being even greater. The cathodic protection applied to the UASF has been grossly inadequate. Based on these findings, it is only a matter of time before another failure occurs. The most recent failure could have caused personnel injury (The spouting of water and air and the throwing of mud). Therefore, it is the recommendation of the Investigation Panel that the UASF be abandoned and another high pressure air storage facility, if needed, be constructed. The idea of an underground facility should not be rejected because of the recent experience. An underground facility seems attractive from a safety standpoint and, with a properly designed protection system, should be considered with other alternatives in an engineering study. The Investigation Panel recognizes that the missions and goals of the Center may require the continued use of the existing field in the interim. The Investigation Panel has given consideration to this possibility and offers the following guidelines: Convert the existing manual isolation valves, on each cluster, to remote actuation to allow isolation of an individual cluster and limit the release of energy. Install a venting system, to vent a cluster in case of emergency, to further reduce the release of energy. This vent could be a simple rupture disk that is punctured by a remotely actuated knife. Install an adequate cathodic protection system to slow or arrest the anodic corrosion. The possibility exists of using the test well as the sacrificial anode. Inspect the remaining casings to determine their condition. The maximum operating pressure should be based on engineering analysis of the condition of the field and the required additional life.","Lesson ID":868}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Clarify the crew leader's role and responsibility in relationship to the truck driver's role and responsibility. Require a more critical inspection by the crew leader of all loads prior to moving any loads. Place more emphasis on center-of-gravity problems\/considerations in current crane operating safety courses. Since we will probably have to handle this same load again, determine and incorporate a safe means for future handling. Continue to furnish, or supplement, advanced training to maintain a high level of safety awareness on the part of all riggers. Consult private industry rigging firms to determine new methods. Insist upon the proper utilization of hand signals between the crane operator and the load spotter. In the future, attach a tether line to all loads.","Lesson ID":865}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Ensure that adequate design and stress analysis have been done and documented for all critical components in models and test hardware. Insure that all components have sufficient load capacity. Perform comprehensive design review and instrument accordingly for health monitoring. An important goal is to do a comprehensive FMECA by knowledgeable systems engineers or designers, prioritize potential failures based on probability, look at consequences of failure in priority order, and then develop instrumentation and emergency procedures on this basis. This is a difficult task, but when there are many potential single-point failures and the consequences of failure is high, it is worth significant effort. Bearings and fasteners are notorious failure points (even if not highly loaded). They must be monitored, maintained, and replaced accordingly. During design reviews, do not overlook parts designed by contractors even though this may be difficult for proprietary reasons. Because some parts have high safety factors does not mean they all do. In fact, hardware that has been used and modified several times is very likely to have a large variation in safety factors. If control systems are designed to lock up to preclude further inputs, Wind Tunnel Emergency Stop should be the only course of action when lock up occurs. Minimize voice directions during emergencies. When open loop control systems are difficult to control, they should be automated (loop closed). When doing research in which control rates are sensitive, human factor considerations become important and must be considered. There should be inspections or verification during assembly and maintenance procedures at critical points. It should not be up to one person to be responsible for the entire assembly or maintenance. Documentation must be comprehensive.","Lesson ID":869}

Proper alignment is the largest factor in determining the life of bearings, seals and couplings. Even quotflexiblequot couplings fail to completely absorb the additional stresses caused by misalignment. Misalignment causes these crucial components to become overloaded and break down prematurely, especially when operating at high speed. More conventional methods, such as using feeler gages and dial indicators are too inaccurate and require a complicated, time consuming alignment process.","Lesson ID":882}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Predictive maintenance is a technique which checks the \"health\" of an item while it is operating using one or more sophisticated tools. The capabilities for predictive maintenance exists because of the availability of desktop computers, and the increased sophistication of equipment monitoring instruments.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When a pneumatically actuated valve is deactivated and the valve changes position, the valve diaphragm returns to the normal position and provides a vacuum at the actuator breather. This results in the outside air being drawn into the actuator chamber, along with any contaminants in the air. At the Space Shuttle launch pads the contaminants that are in the air include salt spray, SRB exhaust, possible N2O4 vapors, and water from high humidity. The contaminants cause corrosion in the actuator chamber affecting the operation of the valve. Providing GN2 to the actuator breather eliminates the possibility of drawing contaminants into the chamber.","Lesson ID":867}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Fiber optics can enhance the transmission quality, capacity, and safety environment of the system. The system designer should carefully weight the pros and cons of fiber optics vs. copper, microwave, or satellite for the transmission medium.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Digital potentiometers should be considered in new design or major redesign of electronic systems where comprehensive system control, monitoring, configuration and calibration functions are desired (both locally and remotely). Standard devices (electromechanical potentiometers) are limited to manual control.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"While this practice may seem to be one that would routinely be found in a maintenance program, in reality that's not so. All too often it is assumed that a new part is not only serviceable, but that it also meets the specification requirements as advertised. However, due to process variables, inspection techniques, and even fraud, this is not always the case. Example: in February 1992 KSC was alerted by NASA HQ\/Code QR that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission working with the Inspector General was issuing a GIDEP\/Alert on suspect circuit breakers. The situation described that a particular vendor took used circuit breakers from various manufacturers, refurbished the exterior only, falsified circuit breaker data and sold them as new components. These breakers had experienced premature trip, failure to trip (some breakers were not of proper amperage, i.e., mislabeled), and some had exploded. Had KSC not had practice GP-1002, quotMaintenance and Test Criteria for Circuit Breakers,quot in place, suspect circuit breakers could have easily been introduced into KSC's GSE and Facility equipment supporting the Space Shuttle Program. A maintenance program that provides for testing of circuit breakers prior to or upon installation will eliminate these types of failures.","Lesson ID":848}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Ferrography is a wear particle analysis utilizing diagnostic and predictive techniques to evaluate the on-line condition of interacting lubricated or fluid powered parts or components. The use of Ferrography to evaluate a system's condition is to avoid time-consuming and potentially damaging hardware teardown and other destructive or interfering inspections. Ferrography can analyze a system's fluid to determine the type of wear it is experiencing; and, hence, predict the type of system failure and when the failure may occur. Ferrography can provide an established and easily performed inspection method for determining the health of a system and providing an early failure detection method.","Lesson ID":846}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The testing provides cost savings thru detection of leaks in air\/fluid systems that are not normally audible. Compressors and fluid pumps may run at above normal requirements to make up for the loss caused by leaks creating unnecessary costs to power the equipment. Bearing problems can be evaluated over a period of time to detect progressive wear by changes in the ultrasound intensity level, thus protecting the bearing from sudden failure. Testing of electrical systems for sounds of arcing is easily accomplished enabling loose connections and openings to be found. Ultrasound testing is one of the least complex and less expensive maintenance detection methods, requiring a hand held detector and associated meter.","Lesson ID":847}

The markings on the outside of the pipe show content in color code, the flow direction, pressures and name of contents (See Figure 1).","Lesson ID":844}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Predictive maintenance is a condition driven preventive maintenance program. Instead of relying on industrial average-life statistics to schedule maintenance activities, predictive maintenance uses direct monitoring of the mechanical condition, system efficiency, and other indicators to determine the most efficient time to service a piece of machinery. Since mechanical systems or machines account for the majority of equipment, vibration monitoring is generally the key component of most predictive maintenance programs because it can provide the greatest benefits. Also, equipment down time is not required for vibration analysis to occur.","Lesson ID":845}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The development of the Space Station and other space systems (i.e., Space Station payloads and experiments) requiring long-term maintenance support dictates maintenance planning with emphasis on an understanding of the level of support required over a given period of time. The program is written specifically for analyzing availability, life cycle cost, and resource scheduling.

The scheduling will comply with any constraints on component production, resupply vehicle capacity, on-site spares, crew manpower and equipment.","Lesson ID":829}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Detection of anomalous behavior is critical during the operation of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Increasing the detectability of failures during the steady-state operation of the SSME will minimize the likelihood of costly engine damage and maintenance. The average power signal algorithm is superior to the time series algorithm because more parameters contribute to the first simultaneous failure indication times. This increases the agreement between several parameters, thus increasing the likelihood that an engine anomaly has occurred. This method also reduces the number of false failure indications that can prematurely shut down the engine during testing or operation.","Lesson ID":830}

The failed parts were analyzed upon return from the repair mission and found to contain defects that would have been revealed through screening. In one case, the microcircuit had a metallization flaw; in the second, the CMOS microcircuit had contamination on the die.

There are often unforeseen deficiencies in the redundancy switching which result in non-independence, thereby defeating the intent. Failure to use this practice will very probably result in several instances of defective switching in a complex system such as a spacecraft. Experience has shown that initial designs have about a 10 percent chance of non-independence.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The absence of independent review of reliability analyses results in the very real possibility of not detecting a design defect. The process rapidly degenerates if the design analyst feels that the analysis task is performed simply to satisfy a project milestone. The depth and accuracy of the analysis suffers, and because of the lack of feedback (positive or negative), there is no increase in technical competence. An independent review with no closed-loop correction system is of little value because experience has shown that condoned apathy will replace corrective action in many cases.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Figure 1 shows an analysis of a typical radio and digital subsystem for a flight instrument with a 3- year mission, no redundancy (except TWTs), and partial redundancy in critical circuits for both Class S and B parts. The parts count method provided in MIL-HDBK-217E was applied. These calculations are not considered accurate for any usage in an absolute sense, due to other design and test factors the database cannot estimate. However, relative comparisons are very useful and accurate for tradeoff studies of effects of redundancy and parts classifications. [D] The data are presented in graphical format for ease of understanding. On each plot, the basic reliability for the assumed conditions is plotted on the left ordinate, years are plotted on the abscissa, and the ratio of the analyzed condition is plotted on the right ordinate. In a single-string (nonredundant) design like Figure 1, the decline in system reliability over time is much less for a system built entirely of Class S parts than if it were built of Class B parts. The ratio of the two reliabilities for a 5-year mission indicates the system built of Class S parts is 50 times more reliable than the system built of Class B parts. When critical system circuits are made redundant, the time dependent reliability with both Class S and B parts is improved, but the improvement for the system built with B parts is greater (Figure 2). However, the 5-year mission reliability for the system built with B parts is still 20 times less than for the system built with Class S parts. [D] A correlation is made between the single string (nonredundant) system built with Class S parts and the system with redundant critical circuits and Class B parts (Figure 3). In this correlation, it is clear that for a 5-year mission the single-string system with Class S parts was still 10 times more reliable than the system with redundancy made from Class B parts. [D] This example reflects that the payoff in reliability is significant for Class S parts compared to Class B parts (for a 5-year mission, Class S is 20 to 50 times more reliable depending on redundancy). Additionally, the return on reliability, addressing non-random failures, is higher for Class S parts than for redundancy used with Class B parts. The highest reliability is obtained with Class S parts with redundancy in the critical circuits.","Lesson ID":709}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Nonpractice of deterministic fracture mechanics analysis (or test) in a spacecraft or launch vehicle program would result in the failure to meet NASA design requirements for fracture control [references 11 and 12]. Failure to adequately consider fatigue in the design of structural and mechanical components subject to fluctuating loads may, at best, result in recurring costs for repair or replacement of components before their intended design life. At worst, a catastrophic failure, in terms of economic loss and loss of life, may result. It is standard JSC engineering practice to specify fracture control requirements on structural and mechanical components that are classified as fracture critical. As a part of these requirements, it is required that a component be shown by analysis or test to be able to survive a deterministic minimum number of service lifetimes (usually 4) without the largest possible undetectable flaw growing to failure [references 11 and 12]. While this process has proven to be adequate to ensure against failure, design practices which do not take advantage of stochastic methods for fracture analysis may produce over-conservative and uneconomical structures and mechanisms. In mechanical or structural system reliability analyses, failure to use a stochastic fatigue or fracture mechanics approach to the estimation of reliability will result in life estimates that are incompatible and inconsistent with the results of the standard NASA deterministic safe-life analyses required by the Space Shuttle and Space Station Programs [references 11 and 12].","Lesson ID":700}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Heat transfer by means other than the heat pipe can have the following impacts: a price paid with respect to weight and size of the heat transfer equipment, significant heat lost in transfer over considerable distances, electromotive devices, such as liquid pumps, required to move the heat, and possible problems presented by operation in zero gravity. Nonadherence to the implementation methods presented above could result in the following possible impacts: improper cleaning and processing of the aluminum container could result in contaminants reacting with the ammonia to form NCG, which will interfere with the flow of vapor and reduce the heat transfer effectiveness. Contaminants reacting with ammonia normally produce hydrogen, and the gas collects in the condenser region. As more and more of the condenser is blocked, the surface area available for heat rejection decreases, reducing the heat transfer effectiveness; ultimately, the heat pipe may cease to function. Failure to certify welds at the end caps and the fill tube could result in improper or defective welds permitting leaks or catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Impact of Nonpractice: As an example of noncompliance, consider a spacecraft bus, containing critical electronic parts, whose shear plate and thermal blanket are adjacent (i.e., not separated by the standoff which characterizes a suitable two-surface particle shield). The largest incident particle, namely that for which the area-fluence product is near unity (ref. Table 1) is then, for long-duration missions in low Earth orbit or in the inner solar system, capable of penetrating the electronics housing or of producing spallation from the inner surface. In either case a single impact introduces numerous fast-moving fragments into the electronics themselves, several electronic parts will be disabled simultaneously, and the probability is high that the subsystem's function will be severely compromised, resulting in mission failure if the subsystem is critical. Even if redundant assemblies are provided, they should not be packaged together, because one particle impact may destroy them both. Even if packaged separately, the likelihood of two impacts (of a penetrating particle) is only modestly smaller than that of one impact, so that redundancy is a far more expensive and less effective option than the provision of suitable particle impact shielding in the first place. An equally serious failure resulting from noncompliance is illustrated by the scenario, extensively investigated for the Galileo spacecraft, that a meteoroid penetration of the propellant tanks could result in loss of fuel, a consequent change in the spacecraft velocity vector, unintended reentry into the Earth's atmosphere (instead of the intended close flyby for gravitational assist), and widespread atmospheric dispersion of radioactive fuel from the RTGs (radioisotope thermoelectric generators). In this scenario, failure to provide adequate meteoroid protection could have both life-threatening and major legal consequences, albeit with small probability. An exceptionally thorough analysis, in which the velocity distributions and the time dependence of the meteoroid flux were used in addition to the appropriate analogs of the above equations, was needed to quantify this small probability.","Lesson ID":679}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Board has concluded that there were no anomalies on-board the SOHO spacecraft but that a number of ground errors led to the major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft. The Board finds that the loss of the SOHO spacecraft was a direct result of operational errors, a failure to adequately monitor spacecraft status, and an erroneous decision which disabled part of the on-board autonomous failure detection. Further, following the occurrence of the emergency situation, the Board finds that insufficient time was taken by the operations team to fully assess the spacecraft status prior to initiating recovery operations. The Board discovered that a number of factors contributed to the circumstances that allowed the direct causes to occur. FACTORS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSS The Board has concluded that there were no anomalies on-board the SOHO spacecraft but that a number of ground errors led to the major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft. The first two errors were contained in predefined command sequences executed from the Ground System, while the last error was a decision to send a command to the spacecraft in response to unexpected telemetry. The sequence of these errors and their relationship to the triggered-ESRs are graphically depicted in Diagram 1. [D] Diagram 1. Failure Event Tree - Top Level (Click image for a larger view) This series of events was preceded by a routine calibration of the spacecraft's three roll gyros. As stated earlier, the gyros are not required during most of the mission. They are used for thruster-based activities such as momentum management, ISA, and ESR. Since the gyro calibration in the compressed timeline is immediately followed by the execution of momentum management, the previously employed procedure to despin the gyros at the end of the gyro calibration and to re-enable the on-board software gyro control function was not required. Following gyro calibration, Gyro A was specifically deactivated (despun) in order to conserve its life, while Gyros B and C remained fully active. Due to an omission in the modified predefined command sequence actually used, the onboard software function that activates the gyro needed by ESR was not enabled. This omission resulted in the removal of the functionality of the normal safe mode and ultimately caused the catastrophic sequence of events. Following the momentum management maneuver, Gyro B, which is used for fault detection, was erroneously left in its high gain setting, resulting in an indicated roll rate of 20 times greater than actual. The incorrect gain was due to an error in another predefined command sequence; this error resulted in an on-board fault detection output that triggered an ESR. This ESR, the 5th since launch, occurred at 7:16 PM EDT (23:16 UT), June 24, 1998. During ESR-5, the control Gyro A was not active because of the first error referenced above; however, there is no evidence or belief that any anomalous spacecraft behavior had occurred. As per design, the ESR event resulted in a reconfiguration of the gyros. Gyro A replaced Gyro C as the roll gyro used for the ESR thruster-based control mode, while Gyro B remained configured as the fault detection gyro. The error in Gyro B's gain was discovered and corrected, but the Gyro A despun status was not identified. After transitioning to the ISA mode as part of the normal ESR recovery sequence, the attitude control system began integrating the gyro drift rate bias associated with the still despun Gyro A. After 15 minutes, this resulted in roll thruster firings intended to null the apparent (but non-existent) roll attitude error. In less than one minute, the roll rate was sufficiently high to trigger the Gyro B based fault detection once again, resulting in ESR-6 at 10:35 PM EDT (02:35 UT), June 24, 1998. Although the spacecraft remained Sun-pointing within nominal limits and was therefore in a power-positive and thermally-safe attitude, the state of the spacecraft was precarious at this point in time. It had an anomalous roll rate and was depending on a deactivated gyro for roll control in both ESR and ISA modes. The personnel on the ground were not aware of either of these facts at that time. Gyro C was correctly configured to the ACU since the reconfiguration at ESR-5. Gyro B was active and on-line for fault detection, and it was correctly measuring the anomalous roll rate. A rapid decision was made that Gyro B was faulty because its output disagreed with the rate indicated by Gyro A. This decision led to the commanding off of Gyro B. During ESR-6 recovery, Ground Operations commanded the spacecraft to ISA mode. In ISA, the attitude control system resumed firing roll thrusters in an attempt to null the attitude error associated with the electrical rate bias term of the despun Gyro A. Gyro B and the associated fault detection were now inactive. The increasing roll rate eventually resulted in pitch and yaw Sun-pointing errors that exceeded a prescribed limit of five degrees, resulting in ESR-7 at 12:38 AM EDT (04:38 UT), June 25, 1998. Due to the gyroscopic cross-coupling torques caused by pitch and yaw thruster firings, and the absence of true roll rate indications, the ESR controller was no longer stable, and the spacecraft attitude diverged. The incorrect diagnosis of a Gyro B fault and the subsequent ground response to this diagnosis ultimately resulted in loss of attitude control, subsequent loss of telemetry, and loss of power and thermal control. Loss of telemetry occurred at 12:43:56 AM EDT (04:43:56 UT), June 25, 1998. It can not be determined whether this loss was a consequence of insufficient power or a loss of communication link caused by spacecraft attitude. At any time during the over five hour emergency situation, the verification of the spinning status of Gyro A would have precluded the mishap. For further information, a more detailed timeline summarizing the sequence of events leading up to the mishap is provided in Appendix C. A detailed fault tree analysis supporting the above scenario and the Board's conclusions has been performed by MMS and is on file.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Impact of Nonpractice: Adverse effects of electrostatic charges on space vehicle design, development, test and operation sometimes have been serious. Such effects include inadvertent ignition of electroexplosive devices, spurious triggering of electronics, and damage to insulating materials.

Electrostatic discharges previously had ignited a similar motor without loss of life. In addition, failures of several vehicles after launch have been attributed to electrostatic discharges. Electrostatic discharges in the atmosphere can have adverse effects on launch operation. NASA SP-8084, revision of June 1974, gives models that should be applied to electrostatic problems. The lightning strikes on Apollo 12, shortly after liftoff, caused major disturbances to on-board electrical systems. Fortunately, most of the effects in this case were of a temporary nature and the mission was able to continue.

Hardware that is susceptible to these radiated emissions can exhibit problems such as microprocessor resets, false or inaccurate engineering data readouts, unintentional mode changes, and noisy or lost scientific data. Cable shielding minimizes these interference problems by isolating hardware from radiated emissions. Numerous EMC tests at GSFC have demonstrated that unshielded cables and wires such as power leads, thermistor, and thermostat leads pick up radiated emission signals and re-radiate them from all areas of a payload. Additionally, the signals are often conducted inside shielded boxes.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"A spacecraft component may possess a significant magnetic moment despite the non-magnetic characteristics of the constituent materials. In this case, the stainless steel tanks were magnetized either during fabrication or by subsequent magnetic exposure. Magnetic contamination is a mission critical risk on spacecraft with magnetic sensitive instrumentation or subjected to magnetic environments during flight.","Lesson ID":642}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The MCO Mishap Investigation board (MIB) has determined that the root cause for the loss of the MCO spacecraft was the failure to use metric units in the coding of a ground software file, quotSmall Forces,quot used in trajectory models. Specifically, thruster performance data in English units instead of metric units was used in the software application code titled SM_FORCES (small forces). A file called Angular Momentum Desaturation (AMD) contained the output data from the SM_FORCES software. The data in the AMD file was required to be in metric units per existing software interface documentation, and the trajectory modelers assumed the data was provided in metric units per the requirements. During the 9-month journey from Earth to Mars, propulsion maneuvers were periodically performed to remove angular momentum buildup in the on-board reaction wheels (flywheels). These Angular Momentum Desaturation (AMD) events occurred 10-14 times more often than was expected by the operations navigation team. This was because the MCO solar array was asymmetrical relative to the spacecraft body as compared to Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) which had symmetrical solar arrays. This asymmetric effect significantly increased the Sun-induced (solar pressure-induced) momentum buildup on the spacecraft. The increased AMD events coupled with the fact that the angular momentum (impulse) data was in English, rather than metric, units, resulted in small errors being introduced in the trajectory estimate over the course of the 9-month journey. At the time of Mars insertion, the spacecraft trajectory was approximately 170 kilometers lower than planned. As a result, MCO either was destroyed in the atmosphere or re-entered heliocentric space after leaving Mars' atmosphere. The Board recognizes that mistakes occur on spacecraft projects. However, sufficient processes are usually in place on projects to catch these mistakes before they become critical to mission success. Unfortunately for MCO, the root cause was not caught by the processes in-place in the MCO project. A summary of the findings, contributing causes and MPL recommendations are listed below. These are described in more detail in the body of this report along with the MCO and MPL observations and recommendations. Root Cause: Failure to use metric units in the coding of a ground software file, quotSmall Forces,quot used in trajectory models Contributing Causes: Undetected mismodeling of spacecraft velocity changes Navigation Team unfamiliar with spacecraft Trajectory correction maneuver number 5 not performed System engineering process did not adequately address transition from development to operations Inadequate communications between project elements Inadequate operations Navigation Team staffing Inadequate training Verification and validation process did not adequately address ground software","Lesson ID":641}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Contributing causes of the mishap were as follows: Design of the system for gear stowage required technicians to break the integrity of the helium brake line after integrity had been already verified. No other check was conducted to reverify the integrity of the system after disconnection and reconnection of the line was completed. Landing gear stowage was never identified as a critical process. No special steps were taken to ensure the readiness of this system for flight. During the gear stowage process, there was no record of checking off steps or evidence of cross-checking of work by another person. Distraction or interruption of the mechanical technician during gear stowage operations may have contributed to the nonconnection of the brake line. The design of the DC-XA vehicle and operational procedures were driven by rapid development and low cost. Accordingly, a minimum number of personnel were involved in operations. Also, design was single string, and there was just one flight test vehicle. There was strong reliance on good people but not a lot of margin for human error afforded by the vehicle preparation process. Rapid Prototyping Guidelines or implementation thereof for the DC-XA may have gone too far in the direction of sacrificing quality and reliability. This rapid prototyping concept should be revisited from an operations perspective.","Lesson ID":638}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Past analyses of electronic, mechanical, and optical hardware performance have sometimes focused on steady state characteristics to the exclusion of known transients. As indicated in the WIRE scenario, spacecraft venting configurations designed for steady state flow rates may experience large unexpected blow-down impulses, or even nominal cryogen flows sufficient to cause mission loss or degradation. The inability of the WIRE spacecraft to counteract accelerated venting rates suggests a marginal attitude control system authority. The unavailability of definitive cryostat temperature data during the anomalous venting period hampered early, real-time identification of the root problem (premature cover deployment).","Lesson ID":640}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The WIRE Mishap Review Board has determined that the telescope instrument cover was ejected earlier than planned and at approximately the time the WIRE pyro electronics box was first powered on. The instrument's solid hydrogen cryogen supply started to sublimate faster than planned, causing the spacecraft to spin up to a rate of sixty revolutions per minute over the twelve hours following the opening of the secondary cryogen vent. Without any solid hydrogen remaining, the instrument could not perform its observations. The root cause of the WIRE mission loss is a digital logic design error in the instrument pyro electronics box. The transient performance of components was not adequately considered in the box design. The failure was caused by two distinct mechanisms that, either singly or in concert, result in inadvertent pyrotechnic device firing during the initial pyro electronics box power-up. The control logic design utilized a synchronous reset to force the logic into a safe state. However, the start-up time of the Vectron crystal clock oscillator was not taken into consideration, leaving the circuit in a non-deterministic state for a time sufficient for pyrotechnic actuation. Likewise, the startup characteristics of the Actel A1020 FPGA were not considered. These devices are not guaranteed to follow their quottruth tablequot until an internal charge pump quotstartsquot the part. These uncontrolled outputs were not blocked from the pyrotechnic devices' driver circuitry. There has been no evidence or indication of any component failure although component failures were considered in the investigation. A significant contributing cause of the anomaly was the failure to identify, understand, and correct the electronic design of the pyro electronics box. Design errors in the circuitry, which controlled pyro functions, were not identified. The pyro electronics box design was not peer reviewed, and other system reviews conducted by the instrument design organization did not focus on the electronics box. At the time the Systems Design Review was conducted for WIRE the design of the pyro electronics box was not completed. It is the assessment of the WIRE Mishap Investigation Board that a peer review held during the design process, by people with knowledge of and expertise regarding pyro circuit design would have identified the turn-on characteristics that led to failure. A large number of failure scenarios were evaluated during the investigation to determine the cause of the cover ejection. These included; pre-launch, launch, powered flight, separation, software, operations, design and component reliability faults. Based on comprehensive, systematic review of data, it was determined the cover was most likely ejected at the time the WIRE pyro electronics box was turned on due to a transient condition that exists in the pyro electronics during startup. This transient condition is the direct result of the non-deterministic initialization of a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that controls both the arming and firing circuits in the pyro electronics. Although some design attention was given to the startup behavior of the FPGA, the design contained unidentified idiosyncrasies that triggered the cover ejection. The system design did not contain sufficient start-up lockout protection or independent provisions to prevent the FPGA startup operation from propagating to the firing circuits. The anomalous characteristics of the pyro electronics unit were not detected during subsystem or system functional testing due to the limited fidelity and detection capabilities of the electrical ground support equipment. Post-flight circuit analyses conducted as part of the failure investigation have predicted the existence of the anomaly and it has been reproduced confidently using engineering model hardware.","Lesson ID":637}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Work documentation (work orders and baseline drawings) should reflect the current system configuration. During the investigation, it was found that: The temporary configuration change to the gaseous hydrogen system was initiated on multiple work orders and by different individuals. There was no single document that documented the temporary system configuration. The procedure for performing the work was written using a drawing that had not been updated to show the actual system configuration. Verbal field direction was given when it was discovered the system was not configured per the work order. Incorrect Grayloc clamp removal techniques were used. Upon pressure release, the Grayloc clamp, blind hub, and seal ring became projectiles that had the potential to cause significant personnel injury.","Lesson ID":635}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Identification and installation of fittings requires detailed attention. During the investigation, it was found that the appearance of the 1\/2\" NPT female port was tapered. The NPT female port had a tapered\/finished area on the port face very similar to an AN port face. Careful inspection of the fitting and port is required.","Lesson ID":636}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Pyro electronics design must appropriately consider transient effects known to occur upon powering of the pyro electronics. Pyro inhibits should be considered for mission critical events, particularly if all pyro functions can be simultaneously armed and enabled. Activation should require two separate and independent actions-one to override the inhibit (referred to as quotARMquot or quotSAFE\/ENABLE-ENABLEquot), and another to fire the pyros. Detailed, independent technical peer reviews are essential to assess the integrity of the system design, including an evaluation of the system and mission consequences of the detailed design and implementation: Technical peer reviews for all design elements should be encouraged by project management. Peer reviews should consider the capability and limitations of the support equipment to be used for testing the flight design. Peer review board members should consistently penetrate the system and subsystem functional design and implementation to expose risk areas, particularly where multiple or complex interfaces exist. Ensure adequate fidelity of test and simulation equipment to detect subtle transient events where appropriate. Perform electronics power turn-on characterization tests, particularly for applications involving irreversible events, that include testing for anomalous behavior. Testing of power turn-off characteristics may also be important in some applications.","Lesson ID":634}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"In the microgravity environment it is difficult for crew members to mate and attach sealing surfaces together unless the attachment mechanism assists the crew in applying a load to hold the surfaces together. Designs that help in this attachment include: Screw thread lids, where the screw thread can be started before the seal starts to compress. Cam-lock devices, where the mechanism can be positioned and engaged and then the cam mechanism assists in applying a force to compress the seal. The use of clamps, where the clamp can be positioned and engaged and then a screw thread can be utilized to supply the force to compress the seal and hold the surfaces together. It should be noted that while screw threads are recommended to provide a mechanical advantage to help mate these surfaces, that friction alone (at the screw thread interface) should not be relied upon to hold the components together.","Lesson ID":632}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"It is essential to perform functional verification testing of space flight hardware prior to final hardware acceptance. This testing should include: Test to ensure operational reliability for the full mission duration. Tests to characterize that the system will have acceptable performance under worst-case conditions. This can be a combination of conditions such as: highest temperature environment; highest power output, cooling filters partially blocked, cooling fan failure; etc. Tests to verify end-to-end compatibility that would include: physical and electrical interfaces; data signal compatibility; operational access; and crew interaction. Tests to verify compatibility with the microgravity environment on-board the KC-135. With limited microgravity periods, these tests cannot fully verify functional performance in a sustained microgravity environment, however, they can be used to demonstrate validity of concept and crew interface compatibility.","Lesson ID":633}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Given the crucial role of the crew-hardware interface in accomplishing science objectives, specific attention must be paid to human factors and ergonomic principles. All hardware (even if previously qualified) must be subjected to a crew applied loads analysis or evaluation for the new application. Hardware to be used by the crew should be evaluated for the maximum load that the crew could apply, as opposed to loads applied in a nominal position.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When designing airflow systems for use aboard the shuttle the following items should be considered for air inlet filters: The filters should be designed oversized so that they will still perform satisfactorily when 50% blocked. To expedite maintenance, the filter should be designed to be easily replaced or easily removed to facilitate cleaning. If the filter is not designed to be replaced, then it should be sized and designed to facilitate cleaning. Filters need to be sized large enough from a human factors standpoint to allow crew members to have (hand or finger) access. Filter cleaning should not be based on having the crew use duct tape to adhere to or remove attached debris. This is both inefficient and ineffective.","Lesson ID":629}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When performing ground based thermal testing of space flight hardware, care has to be taken to remove the effect of natural hot air convection. One of the most practical ways to accomplish this is to perform the thermal tests in an oven or thermal chamber where the overall environmental temperature can be raised to be the maximum temperature allowable. In this way, the effect (both heat load and performance) of the hardware being tested can be identified and evaluated.","Lesson ID":630}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"While it is important to have air filters on the air-inlet to space flight hardware (to facilitate cleaning), it is equally important to have a filter directly in front of any internal fan blades to protect the fans from debris (regardless of source) during in-flight operations. Not only will this protect the fans from debris caused by external sources, but it will allow the fans to remain operational if any of the internal components become loose (or float free) during the launch.","Lesson ID":628}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Design analyses should include (a) Failure Modes and Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and sneak circuit evaluation for potential electrical issues, and (b) Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) for potential mechanical issues. These analyses must be conducted in an integrated manner at the system level to ensure that the electrical implications of mechanical\/packaging design decisions are understood. System design planning and processes must address hardware performance during assembly and test as well as during flight (the DS2 electronic switch design was almost impossible to assemble without an anomaly). Where the use of safing devices is required, the system design and assembly\/test procedures must accommodate their use throughout assembly and test operations.","Lesson ID":626}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Board found that the loss of the Lewis Spacecraft was the direct result of an implementation of a technically flawed Safe Mode in the Attitude Control System. This error was made fatal to the spacecraft by the reliance on that unproven Safe Mode by the on orbit operations team and by the failure to adequately monitor spacecraft health and safety during the critical initial mission phase. The Board also discovered numerous other factors that contributed to the environment that allowed the direct causes to occur. While the direct causes were the most visible reasons for the failure, the Board believes that the indirect causes were also very significant contributors. Many of these factors can be attributed to a lack of a mutual understanding between the contractor and the Government as to what is meant by Faster, Better, Cheaper. These indirect contributors are to be taken in the context of implementing a program in the Faster, Better, Cheaper mode: Requirement changes without adequate resource adjustment Cost and schedule pressures Program Office move Inadequate ground station availability for initial operations Frequent key personnel changes Inadequate engineering discipline Inadequate management discipline The Board strongly endorses the concept of \"Faster, Better, Cheaper\" in space programs and believes that this paradigm can be successfully implemented with sound engineering, and attentive, and effective management. However the role changes for Government and Industry are significant and must be acknowledged, planned for and maintained throughout the program.Since these roles are fundamental changes in how business is conducted, they must be recognized by all team members and behaviors adjusted at all levels. The Board observed an attempt during the early phase of the Lewis Program to work in a Faster, Better, Cheaper culture, but as the Program progressed the philosophy changed to business as usual with dedicated engineers working long hours using standard processes to meet a short schedule and skipping the typical Government oversight functions.","Lesson ID":625}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Sea Winds test program demonstrated that semi-rigid coaxial RF cable failures are difficult to avoid. Consider using flexible cable. If the design decision is to use semi-rigid cabling, provide ample strain relief loops, structurally join the two cable mounting points so that the load path does not go through the cable, and ensure that the natural frequency of the cable does not match the resonant frequency of the support structure. Stress and fatigue analysis should be performed on the cables to establish margin. Semi-rigid RF cable failures often cannot be detected by visual examination. During inspections following vibration test of the Sea Winds SES, hairline cracks were missed several times. When inspecting semi-rigid cables after vibration testing, use a magnifying glass with very good lighting, and look very carefully for cracks. During thermal vacuum testing of semi-rigid cables, carefully monitor RF output signals for signs of signal drift that may indicate a cracked cable. Consider conducting several thermal cycles to increase the likelihood of crack detection. Testing of PFMs may permit only in-situ visual examination of components, while STM tests typically allow cables to be removed from the unit for close examination. Where funding and schedule permits, structures joined by semi-rigid cables should be tested in a developmental model, such as an STM, that facilitates cable removal and inspection. After a cable assembly passes environmental test, a second quotidenticalquot cable may fail due to minor differences in manufacture and installation. To the extent feasible, cable receiving inspection, assembly, and installation should be standardized so that test results on one cable are valid on subsequent articles.","Lesson ID":624}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The purpose of lessons learned is to provide a global overview of what value-added engineering design and testing practices can be obtained from studying this mishap. In addition, improvements in other processes are also pointed out. The lessons learned are not intended to be additional \"recommendations,\" however, their application is certainly intended to be implemented as good engineering practice. The board, in most cases, related the lessons learned to their findings and recommendations where applicable, however, they did not feel constrained by them. The lessons learned are as follows: All components proposed for use in high pressure systems should have demonstrated functionally in an application and environments comparable to their intended use. If the above is not feasible, the component design drawing should be fully assessed or the system should be tested under appropriate conditions in an inert environment and disassembled and inspected prior to use in oxygen environments. Chairpersons of Design Reviews, ORIs, etc., should make sure that review documentation accurately reflects the hardware under review. Prospective suppliers should be required to provide historical data to verify their qualification to supply components for the specified environment and intended use. Performance Specifications for purchases of high pressure components must include requirements for demonstrated capability in the media and environment in which the component is to be used. Extreme caution should be exercised when a significant discrepancy exists between expected and actual test data. Testing should not proceed until the discrepancy has been explained to the satisfaction of appropriate discipline experts, and the test team deems it acceptable to proceed.","Lesson ID":617}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Use of a powerful computer (20 MIPS) with large memory for margin management provided flexibility in software development for MPF. Consider use of a commercial standard backplane (e.g., VME) and avionics standard bus (such as MIL-STD-1553) to allow the fast development of realistic test environments using commercial hardware and software. The early MPF risk assessments prompted the use of an essentially single string avionics design, which resulted in a great reduction in the complexity of the software. A multitasking execution model permits parallel development of separate modules and is supported by a variety of commercial products. Purchase a commercial operating system (kernel) rather than developing one in house. Select a mature flexible implementation language, with mature development tools, such as the C language. The MPF project combined the Command Data Subsystem (CDS) and Attitude Control Subsystem (ACS) hardware and software functions in one processor. This greatly simplified hardware design, ground and flight software design, system implementation, and integration and test. Consider using software system analysts to directly produce flight code, instead of just writing software specifications and handing them to a flight software team to code.","Lesson ID":593}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Inconsistencies in Ground Testing vs. On-Orbit Configuration: Ground testing should mirror on-orbit configuration to the maximum extent possible. Ground hardware should undergo test program as similar as possible to flight units (e.g, thermal, vibration, acoustical, etc.). For those areas that can not be made to be consistent with on-orbit configuration and\/or pre-mission flight unit test program, analysis should be performed to justify and\/or extrapolate test results to the on-orbit environment and flight units. Use of COTS Products Beyond Recommended Design\/Operations: The need to use a small, commercially made valve was emphasized and recommended by an independent Review Team very early in the program. The choice of the selected valve was driven by what was available in the marketplace, and by spacecraft constraints, cost, and schedule. In order to meet instrument needs, it was necessary to operate the valve outside of manufacturer's recommendations. COTS products should be carefully chosen to be consistent with system defined specifications. Testing or analysis should be performed to identify and understand risks, to the COTS as well as to the mission goals, associated with operating COTS in other than recommended manner. Use of Emerging Technology: The selected valve was an immature, emerging-technology product line and was available through only one vendor. The original vendor is no longer producing the valve and has no remaining in-house expertise to support on-orbit anomaly analysis and resolution. Risk is expected when dealing with emerging technology; however, the customer should attempt to mitigate these risks by fully investigating the stability of the supplier, the future market of the product, and the future availability of engineering analysis support. COTS Workmanship: Pre-mission analysis indicated inconsistent workmanship on the 3 analyzed valves. Risk mitigation was put in place on the customer side by a filtering, selection process complemented by an extensive ground test program. Additional effort should be considered to mitigate risk by partnering with the vendor to improve vendor workmanship prior to customer delivery to provide a higher quality product and\/or to include an opportunity for customer inspection before a non-recoverable process (e.g., final sealing) is performed. On-orbit Mitigation: Although the valves were recognized as a high risk element of the instrument development, no analysis was performed on a low-cost, possibly degraded, on-orbit gas control mechanism to fall back on in case of on-orbit valve failure. Given overall mission constraints, this was consistent with the approach taken for ACE. However, it is generally recommended that pre-mission analysis should include evaluation of most probable failures and the identification of low cost, degraded on-orbit back-up approaches that could result in continuing science taking in a potentially degraded mode at marginal cost. Consequence of Additional Risks of Faster, Better, Cheaper (FBC) Mission Environment: In order to meet the spacecraft limitations, cost, and schedule envelope to fly in the FBC environment, Projects must at times accept higher risk associated with emerging technology, non-space qualified parts, and\/or COTS products. Failures, likely to become more frequent in this paradigm, should be expected, accepted, and built upon as a resource to mitigate future mission risks. Required emerging technology such as these low power, low mass micro-valves should be identified to NASA technology programs as a technology to be selected for future initiatives to allow some level of test, verification, and improvement prior to operational flight.","Lesson ID":594}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Post flight testing determined that water, resulting from moisture produced during the smoldering process, provide an apparent electrical coupling between pins 9 and10 of the integrated circuit responsible for temperature compensation. The condition was repeated in the laboratory, producing the same results as those encountered in flight. Water on the card connector contacts likewise produced similar results. Increasing thickness of conformal coating on the circuit board to twice that originally used verified water no longer caused the coupling problem between the integrated circuit pins 9 and 10. Additionally, circuit board and chamber connectors were sealed with RTV to prevent water incursion. Conformal coating nominally used as a contamination and flammability barrier does not necessarily provide an effective electrical barrier.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Premature depletion of one propellant can occur in bipropellant systems if engine and component acceptance test data are not properly considered when determining the flight propellant loads. The level of dissolved gases in the oxidizer should also be considered. For nitrogen tetroxide\/hydrazine engines similar to those intended for use in future planetary missions, oxidizer depletion may be difficult to detect from accelerometer readings because of (a) the residual thrust of the hydrazine operating in monopropellant mode and (b) random slugs of oxidizer which may continue to be ingested by the engine for tens of seconds after the first bubbles are ingested.","Lesson ID":572}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board made several observations in the course of the investigation. Among these are that: the tether failure is not indicative of any fundamental problem in using electrodynamic tethers; there was a significant amount of scientific data secured from the flight, before the tether separated; the science, engineering and support teams were highly competent, motivated, and committed to the experiment; electrostatic charge build-up could be an issue in the future; the documentation provided by the project to the Board was appropriate; the tether configuration was affected by the winding loads on the reel; the load paths of the composite tether are complex; closed areas with a favorable pressure-distance combination (Paschen's Law) can cause arcing if not vented. The TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board finally observed that the long time span between the fabrication of the hardware and the flight missions increased the exposure of the hardware to contamination and damage.","Lesson ID":566}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Establish \"First, do no harm\" as the overriding principle guiding both fault protection design and the ground response to in-flight anomalies. Where it is not practical to record and downlink all telemetry, future missions should continuously buffer a small amount of high-rate telemetry as it is being downlinked at a lower rate. Should a fault occur, high-rate data for the period immediately preceeding and following the fault could be stored for later retrieval.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Although this fire happened some time ago, there were no personnel injuries, and damage was relatively minor, there were some significant lessons learned: Sparks and hot chips generated during the cutting operations apparently came to rest in a hidden area, created a hot spot, and, approximately 90 minutes after cutting operations were completed, the hot spot ignited into a full fire. Fire watches normally cease one hour after cutting operations are ended. Under certain circumstances, such as those found in this situation, existing procedures may be inadequate to insure no fire hazard remains. Therefore, each job should be individually evaluated to make sure the fire watch surveillance period is sufficient. Security measures should cover entry of emergency personnel to controlled\/limited access areas. Unnecessary delays can significantly increase fire damage. In this incident, use of material stored in ready access for the covering of electronic equipment in the event of fire prevents water damage. Readiness of this type of material could have benefit in other facilities should a fire occur.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Lack of knowledge\/awareness of the effects of negative \"G\" forces may have contributed to the crash. No supervision of flight, suggests oversight function could have identified need for preflight training. Fact sheet material not clearly defined in function may have resulted in directive material being interpreted as advisory. Review of flight manual indicated possible lapse in updating material or in pilot training or both. Modifications made to aircraft may not have been reviewed\/approved by safety, even though made for safety and flight reasons. Board review of accident was less effective because there was no flight data recording to evaluate. Flight managers must emphasize importance of adherence to emergency escape decision altitudes at preflight for high angle of attack maneuvers.","Lesson ID":493}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Configuration must be baselined and accepted before modification to understand design, identify all necessary changes, assess effects on whole. Incomplete data recording and maintenance of operational logs resulted in incomplete determination of effects. Abnormal operating conditions producing effects that are unanticipated or can not be explained should be investigated prior to continuing testing.

Safety equipment should be used prior to any test or review for safety of operation, adequate warning, and\/or understanding of operation.","Lesson ID":494}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Procedures for effective systems engineering on safety issues are lacking. System safety and R&QA omitted for project design decisions results in design deficiencies and possibly manufacturing defects affecting safety.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Standard circuit designs or parts which operate well at atmospheric pressure need to be verified for vacuum. Circuit changes to solve other problems may induce their own problems.

Spacecraft state is not always easy to identify and errors in spacecraft state determination are possible. This caused some confusion during this event.

Failure to qualify electronic components and assembly capabilities to mission environmental requirements (including numerous power\/thermal cycles) increases risk. Power cycling can create thermal cycle effects on internal failure mechanisms for electronic components and assemblies. Not using dry gas in the repackaging process can allow moisture to be trapped inside electronic components (hermetically sealed packages with a cavity) and possibly create pinholes if they don't already exist.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The IDC was not designed or fabricated in accordance with the following NASA design requirements: NSTS 07700, Volume X; SW-E-0002; KSC-STD-E-0002E; and KSC-E-165E. The IDC purge components were not designed to prevent overpressurization, which caused system failure. Instead of a Bepco enclosure pressure control valve, a Bepco control panel rapid-exchange valve was used to control GN2 system purge. This allowed the rapid release of overpressure, which in turn caused the system to fail. The IDC single-stage regulator was found to have vibrated open, causing the inlet pressure to increase (creep) to 50 psi. The nominal operational pressure setting is 10 psi. This increase in the inlet pressure setting allowed the system to become overpressurized and caused the system to fail. The IDC camera head enclosure lid was not sealed properly because of ground wire interference, which caused a differential in system pressure between enclosures. The bottom clip on the IDC camera battery, power supply, and power supply enclosure were seated but did not catch the enclosure door, which contributed to system purge leakage. NASA lab personnel completed measurement testing before the ICD was put into operational use. However, purge system operation and functional checkout were not performed, which prevented detection of system overpressurization before operational use. The current operational procedure, MDA Prototype Ice Detection Camera User Manual Rev 4.0, was not followed. Use of that operational procedure might have prevented the system overpressurization. A new local procedure for field use will be developed containing all operational steps, notes, cautions, and warnings. The procedure will include a section requiring that such equipment undergo purge and functional checkout in a NASA lab before use in the field. All operators will be trained on the use of the new procedure and the IDC. At the time of this close call, KSC did not have a process to certify prototype equipment used on the Center.","Lesson ID":4456}

Examples include: Passage of a spacecraft through a critical pressure region of the atmosphere following launch. Partial pressurization of a spacecraft in space due to gas leaks from propulsion systems, batteries, etc. Engine firings in vacuum or near vacuum which cause plume wrapping.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Standard circuit designs or parts which operate well at atmospheric pressure need to be verified for vacuum. Circuit changes to solve other problems may induce their own problems. The original problem was an instability in the TWTA power supply caused because the TWT reacted as a negative impedance load, and the power supply helix output voltage was fed back to control the voltage regulator. This problem was corrected by special focusing of the TWT's to minimize their negative load impedance characteristics and by adding a voltage doubler circuit to reduce the power supply's helix voltage output impedance. The changes that corrected the instability problem produced the large AC component on the high-voltage capacitors.","Lesson ID":417}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Heat transfer by means other than the heat pipe can have the following impacts: a price paid with respect to weight and size of the heat transfer equipment, significant heat lost in transfer over considerable distances, electromotive devices, such as liquid pumps, required to move the heat, and possible problems presented by operation in zero gravity. Nonadherence to the implementation methods presented above could result in the following possible impacts: improper cleaning and processing of the aluminum container could result in contaminants reacting with the ammonia to form NCG, which will interfere with the flow of vapor and reduce the heat transfer effectiveness. Contaminants reacting with ammonia normally produce hydrogen, and the gas collects in the condenser region. As more and more of the condenser is blocked, the surface area available for heat rejection decreases, reducing the heat transfer effectiveness; ultimately, the heat pipe may cease to function. Failure to certify welds at the end caps and the fill tube could result in improper or defective welds permitting leaks or catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel. For long-term space missions, working fluids in the appropriate temperature range, such as methanol and water, exhibit an incompatibility with aluminum, and should not be used.","Lesson ID":698}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The mechanism by which this inadvertent destruct action occurred is subtle and not readily apparent at first glance. As implemented, the KLC to P3 hand over procedure for FTS responsibility resulted in simultaneous transmission of all three command tones that are necessary to execute a command destruct action, if they are modulated on the carrier in proper sequence. The ground site at KLC was modulating the \"OPTIONAL\" command on the FTS carrier signal, while the P3 aircraft was modulating the \"ARM\" command. Note that the \"DESTRUCT\" command can be executed any time after the \"ARM\" command is latched. The root cause of the accident was found to be the modulation of all three command tones from two different transmitters during the transfer of FTS control by the Range Safety Officer (RSO), combined with the effects of plume attenuation, caused the onboard receiver to interpret the radiated signals as a \"DESTRUCT\" sequence.","Lesson ID":1254}

This substandard practice is referred to as \u201ccut down billet.\u201d The certification data associated with these final product forms were incomplete, contained some omissions and irregularities, or were derived from test coupons drawn from prime locations within the intermediate products that may not be representative of the cross section from which the final products were obtained. Non-conforming Ti material was confirmed from at least two commercial distributors. There has been no indication of improper Ti alloy processing by mills or conversion houses. (Material \u201cdistributors\u201d typically do not have the thermal-mechanical processing equipment necessary to perform forging or hot rolling operations. Mills and conversion houses typically have such equipment.) Fifty JPL spacecraft and instrument projects were assessed and ultimately cleared of the possibility of having used non-conforming Ti by a combination of refined margin analysis, component testing, and\/or redesign. Although the tested material property non-conformance was relatively small, measures have been implemented by JPL to prevent non-conforming Ti material from entering its supply chain.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"WRIs are notoriously non-linear in stiffness, and their properties and responses change with input load level. Isolator testing done at LaRC by the Project found the stiffness values quoted in the vendor data were not accurate, particularly for the load levels for which they would be used on the CMP. Compared to 2% critical damping used in normal dynamic analysis, the damping with the WRIs was found to be much higher and vary considerably, with as much as 15% damping at low frequencies (0-250 Hz) and around 8% at higher frequencies (250-2000 Hz). When the variable damping schedule and corrected stiffnesses were used in the analysis models, the model results more closely matched the system test results (CMP on isolators).

Improper configuration control and internal or external human performance shaping factors can lead to a false comfort level . Vent systems are often neglected and treated as non-hazardous even though they can capture and contain condensed hypergolic liquids (especially in low points) . Aging support hardware should be routinely inspected to reduce the risk of a failure during critical operations.

Additional tests must be performed to distinguish between candidate resins, and to ensure that required properties not covered by available specifications are met. Materials selection criteria must be constantly re-evaluated to ensure that all key properties are addressed in new applications. Proper resin selection also was found to partially compensate for an unoptimized seal design.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The torque limiters of the External Tank door actuators were redesigned in the early 1990s because of unacceptable degradation of the disk friction surfaces. The new design was a multidisk ball-ramp setup. When the torque reached a certain value, the ball-ramp design reduced the compression load on the disk stack and allowed the disks to rotate relative to each other (slip). The disks in this particular actuator were made of steel and Vespel. After several years of service with the new torque limiter design, most of the actuators exhibited reduced torque output. Investigation determined that the torque limiter degradation was due to grease contamination of the disk surfaces. Inspection confirmed that excess grease was applied to some of the torque limiter components (bearings) during assembly and eventually migrated to the disk surfaces. However, even after the actuators were refurbished, excess grease was removed, and the grease was cleaned from the disks, the actuators often continued to exhibit torque degradation and show evidence of grease contamination of the disks. Another problem was the amount of effort required to set the torque limiter to slip in the required range when the actuator was being serviced. The value at which the torque limiter slips depends somewhat on the temperature, and the actuator is required to operate with a specified torque output through a large temperature range (over 300 \u00b0F). Several rounds of adjustments were needed, each followed by days of testing. In addition, there was degradation of the motor clutch\/brake assemblies in these actuators. Each actuator has two AC motors, each of which interfaces with the gear box differential through a clutch\/brake assembly. For redundancy, the actuator will operate on only one motor. When a motor is not operating, the clutch\/brake assembly is in the brake mode. A friction disk is spring-loaded against a stator, which locks the input to the differential and disconnects it from the motor. This is necessary so that during single-motor operation, the nonoperating motor input is not back-driven through the differential. When the motor starts up, the assembly switches to clutch mode. A solenoid pulls the disk away from the stator, separating the brake surfaces and engaging the clutch surface of the disk to the motor output. The motor then drives the differential input through the clutch. During tests of the actuators on the vehicle, the torque output varied significantly by motor mode. Since there is a single torque limiter, the point at which it slips should be the same regardless of which motor is operating. This indicated that the clutch\/brake assembly was slipping prematurely. Disassembly and inspection confirmed that both the clutch and brake surfaces were worn. There was evidence of scoring on the interfacing surfaces and metallic debris in the assembly.","Lesson ID":2839}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"When tests were performed to determine why newly installed chiller coils were corroding, there were signs that the copper coils had not been cleaned properly before being coated. The coating itself was fine, but there was flaking because the coating did not stick. Because of the environmental restrictions at VAFB, the parties involved decided to ship the coils back to the coating factory in Bakersfield, CA, where they would be cleaned and coated again without being completely removed from the chiller unit. The cleaning process proved to be too acidic and was halted. The unit was sent back to the site and reinstalled until further investigation could be done on the coils. The manufacturer of the chiller units investigated its coil supplier and found that they had begun using a new supplier who used a silicone release agent that was not properly removed by the acid bath. This was the reason the coating did not adhere properly. New coils were manufactured, and the proper release agent was used.

Project management should be included in the proposal stage of a project's life cycle since the lack of front-end PM support increases the difficulty to introduce a project environment later. 2. Inserting a PM into a project for a \"recovery\" or \"rescue\" mission may be an unwelcome and unsuccessful venture if the project does not recognize its potential value and\/or does not identify with the incoming PM. 3. Do not expect a team to \"abandon\" their loyalty to the PI in favor of an outside PM. 4. Do not expect an academic team to buy into formal PM processes immediately. 5.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"During ground testing, a SUBSA Ground Unit Thermal Chamber temperature of about 820 C with qualification Sample Ampoule assemblies (SUBSA-GD1, SUBSA-Q3, and SUBSA-Q4) was sufficient to melt all of the sample charge (approx. 37mm) + about 4mm of the sample's seed. This met the SUBSA Principal Investigator's desire to melt about 2mm into the seed. However, during SUBSA's on-orbit experiment, the flight heater unit temperature of 820 C did not melt into the seed. To melt further into the seed, SUBSA tried to issue a setpoint change command to increase the Thermal Chamber's temperature. The Eurotherm 2408 Controller that controls the Thermal Chamber's temperature would not accept any setpoint change commands above 825 C. Therefore, the SUBSA Thermal Chamber hot zone temperature did not reach the commanded setpoint that is required to achieve the desired science result of melting 2mm into the sample material seed. Overall, the problems experienced with the SUBSA flight hardware and flight software can be directly attributed to programmatic budget and schedule constraints which resulted in inadequate run-time using flight software with flight hardware end items as well as last minute software loads and\/or changes to flight software after shipment to KSC for pre-launch processing.","Lesson ID":1319}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Match COTS tools to project requirements. Deciding to use a COTS product as the basis of system software design is potentially risky, but the potential benefits include quicker delivery, less cost, and more reliability in the final product.

Create a prioritized list of desired COTS features. Talk with local experts having experience in similar areas. Conduct frequent peer and design reviews. Obtain demonstration versions of COTS products. Obtain customer references from vendors. Select a product appropriately sized for your application. Choose a product closely aligned with your project's requirements. Select a vendor whose size will permit a working relationship. Use vendor tutorials, documentation, and vendor contacts during COTS evaluation period. Test and prototype COTS products in the lab. The prototyping and test phase of the COTS evaluation allows problems to be identified as the system design to matures. These problems can be mitigated (often with the help and cooperation of the COTS vendor) well before the field-testing phase at which time it may be too costly or impossible to retrofit a solution.

The current method used by Juno and other spaceflight missions to limit propulsion system contact with propellant vapor to benign concentrations relies largely on quad-redundant check valves, and pyrolitic isolation valves in the oxidizer side. The Juno anomaly exemplifies the risk that high oxidizer vapor content may cause a sticking check valve during a maneuver that will result in the engine operating well outside of the qualified mixture ratio; this may lead to loss of the mission.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The primary cause of the mishap was failure to follow the procedural instructions in PR number PV-6-140247, in which: (1) facility water technicians added a flow test on the Zone 3 system after valve diaphragm repair, and (2) in not fully closing or in improperly reopening the manual riser isolation valve, water was allowed to flow into Zone 3 of the OPF Bay 2 water deluge system. Contributing causes included the following: The OPF GSE technicians, who are members of the \"Contingency Team,\" had not been adequately trained in the operation of the OPF water deluge system. This led to the OPF GSE \"Contingency Team\" technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system, while thinking they were turning the system off. A thorough pre-task briefing (PTB) was not held for the water deluge system valve repair task, which could have prevented deviation from the repair procedure by the facility water technicians. The labeling on the remote manual arming and firing valve activation station of the OPF water deluge system was misinterpreted. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system when they believed they were turning the system off. The remote manual arming and firing valves are in the \"on\" position when perpendicular to the water lines, which is not the industry norm for hydraulic systems. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians believing they were closing the valves by positioning them perpendicular to the water line when, in fact, they were opening the valves. This human factor problem was not addressed in the System Assurance Analysis for the Water System at the OPF, SAA09FY09-007, Revision B, dated July 1987. The manual arming and firing valves behind the OPF are easily accessed by simply opening the individual valve box doors, which destroys the paper integrity seals. Essentially, there was no physical barrier to the valves. Even though redundancy exists for the Viking valves in the deluge system, these valves are open when no dome pressure is applied. Failures which remove dome pressure could result in the flow of water. There are significant configuration differences between the OPF Bay 1 and 2 water deluge systems. The OPF Bay 1 configuration does not include the manual riser isolation valve. Engineering Order E084-79KO5423, which installs the manual riser isolation valve for both bay configurations, has not yet been accomplished for Bay 1. This should be implemented for Bay 1 after OV-103 rollout for STS-33 and prior to another Orbiter occupying Bay 1. There are only 6 boxes for the manual arming and firing valves in the Bay 1 configuration, with the arming and firing valves for a particular zone in the same box. The Bay 2 configuration has 12 boxes, one for each valve. Signs on the boxes are not uniform between OPF Bays 1 and 2. The NASA Test Director (NTD) evacuated OPF Bay 2 via a public address announcement. He could not use the area warning system because OPF Bay 1 would have also been evacuated, which was not required. As a result of the inadvertent activation of the firex deluge system, Orbiter GSE was damaged (i.e., the Mechanical Control Interface Unit for the Remote Manipulating Arm and the Cargo Verification Unit). No redundancy is available for the Mechanical Control Interface Unit. The OPF Bay 2 evacuation during this incident was in accordance with established procedures.

For nitrogen tetroxide\/hydrazine engines similar to those intended for use in future planetary missions, oxidizer depletion may be difficult to detect from accelerometer readings because of (a) the residual thrust of the hydrazine operating in monopropellant mode and (b) random slugs of oxidizer which may continue to be ingested by the engine for tens of seconds after the first bubbles are ingested.","Lesson ID":572}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Board has concluded that there were no anomalies on-board the SOHO spacecraft but that a number of ground errors led to the major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft. The Board finds that the loss of the SOHO spacecraft was a direct result of operational errors, a failure to adequately monitor spacecraft status, and an erroneous decision which disabled part of the on-board autonomous failure detection. Further, following the occurrence of the emergency situation, the Board finds that insufficient time was taken by the operations team to fully assess the spacecraft status prior to initiating recovery operations. The Board discovered that a number of factors contributed to the circumstances that allowed the direct causes to occur. FACTORS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSS The Board has concluded that there were no anomalies on-board the SOHO spacecraft but that a number of ground errors led to the major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft. The first two errors were contained in predefined command sequences executed from the Ground System, while the last error was a decision to send a command to the spacecraft in response to unexpected telemetry. The sequence of these errors and their relationship to the triggered-ESRs are graphically depicted in Diagram 1. [D] Diagram 1. Failure Event Tree - Top Level (Click image for a larger view) This series of events was preceded by a routine calibration of the spacecraft's three roll gyros. As stated earlier, the gyros are not required during most of the mission. They are used for thruster-based activities such as momentum management, ISA, and ESR. Since the gyro calibration in the compressed timeline is immediately followed by the execution of momentum management, the previously employed procedure to despin the gyros at the end of the gyro calibration and to re-enable the on-board software gyro control function was not required. Following gyro calibration, Gyro A was specifically deactivated (despun) in order to conserve its life, while Gyros B and C remained fully active. Due to an omission in the modified predefined command sequence actually used, the onboard software function that activates the gyro needed by ESR was not enabled. This omission resulted in the removal of the functionality of the normal safe mode and ultimately caused the catastrophic sequence of events. Following the momentum management maneuver, Gyro B, which is used for fault detection, was erroneously left in its high gain setting, resulting in an indicated roll rate of 20 times greater than actual. The incorrect gain was due to an error in another predefined command sequence; this error resulted in an on-board fault detection output that triggered an ESR. This ESR, the 5th since launch, occurred at 7:16 PM EDT (23:16 UT), June 24, 1998. During ESR-5, the control Gyro A was not active because of the first error referenced above; however, there is no evidence or belief that any anomalous spacecraft behavior had occurred. As per design, the ESR event resulted in a reconfiguration of the gyros. Gyro A replaced Gyro C as the roll gyro used for the ESR thruster-based control mode, while Gyro B remained configured as the fault detection gyro. The error in Gyro B's gain was discovered and corrected, but the Gyro A despun status was not identified. After transitioning to the ISA mode as part of the normal ESR recovery sequence, the attitude control system began integrating the gyro drift rate bias associated with the still despun Gyro A. After 15 minutes, this resulted in roll thruster firings intended to null the apparent (but non-existent) roll attitude error. In less than one minute, the roll rate was sufficiently high to trigger the Gyro B based fault detection once again, resulting in ESR-6 at 10:35 PM EDT (02:35 UT), June 24, 1998. Although the spacecraft remained Sun-pointing within nominal limits and was therefore in a power-positive and thermally-safe attitude, the state of the spacecraft was precarious at this point in time. It had an anomalous roll rate and was depending on a deactivated gyro for roll control in both ESR and ISA modes. The personnel on the ground were not aware of either of these facts at that time. Gyro C was correctly configured to the ACU since the reconfiguration at ESR-5. Gyro B was active and on-line for fault detection, and it was correctly measuring the anomalous roll rate. A rapid decision was made that Gyro B was faulty because its output disagreed with the rate indicated by Gyro A. This decision led to the commanding off of Gyro B. During ESR-6 recovery, Ground Operations commanded the spacecraft to ISA mode. In ISA, the attitude control system resumed firing roll thrusters in an attempt to null the attitude error associated with the electrical rate bias term of the despun Gyro A. Gyro B and the associated fault detection were now inactive. The increasing roll rate eventually resulted in pitch and yaw Sun-pointing errors that exceeded a prescribed limit of five degrees, resulting in ESR-7 at 12:38 AM EDT (04:38 UT), June 25, 1998. Due to the gyroscopic cross-coupling torques caused by pitch and yaw thruster firings, and the absence of true roll rate indications, the ESR controller was no longer stable, and the spacecraft attitude diverged. The incorrect diagnosis of a Gyro B fault and the subsequent ground response to this diagnosis ultimately resulted in loss of attitude control, subsequent loss of telemetry, and loss of power and thermal control. Loss of telemetry occurred at 12:43:56 AM EDT (04:43:56 UT), June 25, 1998. It can not be determined whether this loss was a consequence of insufficient power or a loss of communication link caused by spacecraft attitude. At any time during the over five hour emergency situation, the verification of the spinning status of Gyro A would have precluded the mishap. For further information, a more detailed timeline summarizing the sequence of events leading up to the mishap is provided in Appendix C. A detailed fault tree analysis supporting the above scenario and the Board's conclusions has been performed by MMS and is on file.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"On Saturday, March 31, the mid-body mechanical supervisor and the lead mechanical technician both had the day off. Supervision was delegated to the lead electrical technician for that shift. He was not familiar with the work to be accomplished or with the capabilities and experience levels of the individuals assigned from the mechanical group. Two individuals were assigned to a task they had not previously performed or observed. The quality inspector was a check and balance that might have caught the error had he been assigned based on his experience with the task or his knowledge of the system. Quality inspectors are not given inspection work based upon their knowledge or previous inspection assignments. They respond to a call-board that lists tasks calling for an inspector; consequently, an inspector appears in a somewhat indiscriminate fashion to perform the inspection task. On second shift, Saturday, March 31, three people unfamiliar with the task came together on platform 4 west to perform and verify Operations and Maintenance Instruction (OMI) V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3. The lead mechanical technician from first shift stayed over to take the assigned technician to platform 4 west to review the task. He failed to mention that the purge vent port should not be capped after removal of the flex hose. There was no precautionary note in the OMI addressing the need to keep the purge vent port clear and open and no placard on the Orbiter. One of the significant shop practices stressed to all technicians working around the Orbiter is to cap disconnected lines or openings to avoid contamination. Personnel are therefore naturally conditioned to cap lines and openings. The fuel cell had to be vented to ambient pressure prior to its removal. The first attempt to vent the fuel cell by a fuel cell system engineer occurred on Wednesday, April 4, at approximately 2 a.m. EDT. The fuel cell was not damaged at this point because the 02 reactant valve did not close. The fact that there was no H2 flow was observed but no Interim Problem Report (IPR) was initiated. A disconnected ground wire from the 02 reactant valve prevented the valve from closing and consequently protected the fuel cell from any damage. A walkdown was not accomplished by engineering. Had such a procedure been implemented, the damage might have been avoided as the fuel cell system engineer might have been alerted to the disconnected ground wire and the capped purge vent port. One thread that runs through the series of events leading up to the mishap is the lack of system training for technicians and quality inspectors. Technicians and quality inspectors are trained and certified in their basic skills, i.e, lockwiring, torquing, etc.; however, they are given no Orbiter systems training. Another factor that contributed to this mishap is the lack of communication between engineering, technicians, and quality. All OMI's are reviewed and approved in detail by several engineering organizations. Some portions of these approved OMI's are then handed over to shop personnel (technicians) to be performed without requiring additional engineering involvement. This same situation exists with the quality inspector who must approve the technicians' work. The personnel are highly motivated and want very much to do a good job. It is essential that they be given the knowledge they need to do that job. The importance of keeping the purge vent port clear and open was not communicated by anyone in the process. The capping of the Orbiter H2 purge vent port during the performance of OMI V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3 was not an isolated incident. On March 19, the same port was capped on the Orbiter Columbia, OV-102, during performance of the same OMI. In this case, an experienced technician checking the work caught the error and had the cap removed. The supervisor was notified but no subsequent action was taken. Had this near-miss been properly communicated to all technicians, engineering, and quality, perhaps the mishap two weeks later could have been avoided. The significance of effective communications cannot be overemphasized in the very complex world of Orbiter processing and test operations. Communications and identification of precautions in the OMI and a good working relationship between the technicians, the engineers, and quality personnel is essential to successful operations. The geography of KSC facilities does not lend itself to ease of overview or development of team unity. The Launch Control Center (LCC) control rooms, from which systems engineers conduct tests, are a considerable distance from the OPF where technicians perform work on the vehicle. The remoteness of the two facilities impedes communications between engineers and technicians. As the program plans new control rooms and equipment, these new rooms could be located in the OPF between the two bays. Many benefits would be derived from the control rooms being in such a location. Having the engineers in close proximity to technicians and the vehicle would improve the overall efficiency of orbiter processing as well as communications among all parties. A key factor in achieving a higher flight rate is reducing OPF flow time. This change could substantially enhance KSC's capability to achieve shorter processing flows. The ability of engineers to perform walkdowns prior to implementing test operations would be greatly facilitated by their proximity and involvement with the work. Operations and Maintenance Instructions are obviously the key documents in ensuring work is done properly at KSC. A review to ensure they are correct and adequate is essential. Following the Challenger accident, direction was given to the design centers to review and concur in all OMI's that affected Criticality 1 or 1R equipment as well as changes to those OMI's. A commitment was also made to the Congress that this would be implemented. In the case of the orbiter, this does not now occur. The Johnson Space Center did review and concur in all OMI's after the Challenger accident and, until the summer of 1989, the JSC Resident Office at KSC concurred in all changes. The apparent lack of discipline in utilizing the paper system resulted in a communication breakdown and confusion that may have contributed to the mishap. There should be a coordinated and documented plan of action between work shifts for accomplishing processing and testing. First and second shifts utilized two different work authorization documents (WAD's) to perform the same task. An IPR was not prepared when anomalous conditions were observed. Constraints were not identified when performing electrical work, i.e., removal of ground wires. A deviation was not logged in a timely fashion. The technicians, engineers, and inspectors at KSC are a highly motivated and dedicated team. Processing and testing of Orbiters is a very complex and demanding task. These personnel are indeed on the firing line three shifts a day, seven days a week. Problems and difficulties are always present. With so much depending upon their ability to perform their work, it behooves us to provide them with all the skills and talents they require. Training, knowledge, and communications are all essential to the task. The cost for repair of this fuel cell is significant, but considering Space Shuttle Operations will continue for as long as 20 more years, it could be an inexpensive lesson if we can learn from this accident and truly apply the lessons learned.","Lesson ID":1182}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Orbiter Engine ICD (13M15000) made no mention of Helium in the LH2 other than quantities allowed per the controlling document SE-S-0073, SPACE SHUTTLE SPECIFICATION, FLUID PROCUREMENT AND CONTROL (27 MAY 1999). This specification established the procurement requirements and the chemical and particulate limitations for fluids used in fluid systems of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB), External Tank (ET), Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), and Orbiter. This specification applied to payloads that have fluid interfaces with the Orbiter or Space Shuttle Ground Support Equipment (GSE). This specification applied throughout all program levels for commonality and to ensure that fluid requirements used for design concepts will be used in verification and operation. The intent and requirements of this specification applied equally to influents and to effluents to the extent specified herein. No testing of GHe ingestion into the LH2 system was ever performed on a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) because the condition of ingesting helium into the system was not addressed. In addition, at the time of the STS-128 launch attempt the SSME test program was over and there was no way to test an engine in the test stands. The rule of thumb on the Shuttle Program is Fly as you test and Test as you fly. Simulated tanking system testing was performed at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in an attempt to quantify how much Helium, if any, could be trapped in the Fill and Drain line. The combination of test results and the paucity of data regarding the capability of the SSME to tolerate GHe injestion resulted in the conclusion that if any Ghe (greater than zero GHe) is present in the system, no flight rationale is possible.","Lesson ID":6146}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"You can\u2019t anticipate every problem you will see in extended mission operations. This type of battery anomaly had been seen in the laboratory, but never before on-orbit. Design tradeoffs and choices made in the development phases may have implications for the operations phase (Phase E). Though they would have facilitated anomaly recovery, the cost-constrained CloudSat project eliminated gyros from the flight system design during Phase B. Due to unanticipated launch delays, CloudSat launched with a battery that had aged after its activation. The CloudSat spacecraft battery design did not permit the independent switching (off) of cells, so the spare cells could not be used due to the risk of overcharge during sunlight. Robust spacecraft fault protection (i.e., load shedding during under-voltage events) and redundancy (i.e., the receiver and Power Distribution Unit (PDU)) were critical to spacecraft survival. Instead of being used for redundancy, one PDU was reassigned to control charging and the other to control UV limits, thereby enabling lower UV fault settings. A failure in one system can cause other failures: the battery UV condition caused the loss of Receiver #1. Following the anomaly, JPL project management, the system subcontractor, and the U.S. Air Force quickly drew in experienced personnel to assist in anomaly resolution. This included veteran CloudSat project design engineers thoroughly acquainted with the spacecraft systems and experienced operations personnel familiar with CloudSat on-orbit operations.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Impact of Nonpractice: The absence of power line filters frequently results in cross interference, which disrupts the proper operation of hardware and can obliterate science data. These problems usually can be identified in ground testing; however, correcting them by retrofitting flight hardware is very difficult and expensive. Therefore, it is important that power line filters be included in the early design of hardware. Significant interference problems can occur on orbit that were not found in ground testing due to unexpected ground loops or to hardware interface situations that could not be duplicated exactly during ground testing. Also, deterioration or partial failure of components and parts can result in increased levels of noise on power and ground buses. Hardware that is susceptible to conducted emissions can exhibit such problems as microprocessor resets, false or inaccurate engineering data readouts, unintentional mode changes, and lost or noisy scientific data. Power line filters minimize these interference problems by isolating hardware from conducted noise on power lines.","Lesson ID":646}

This problem can be diagnosed by examining the screws and the corresponding holes in the mounting blocks for indications of wear consistent with the screw bottoming out.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Lessons Learned\/Recommendations: While environmental testing has demonstrated considerable value to spaceflight projects, such testing always carries inherent risks. Test facilities must be maintained, and over time replaced as necessary, such that the test equipment is in good working order. Metrics must be developed and tracked that assess the mechanical health of the systems. \"Canned\" tests should be developed and periodically utilized to provide a trended database for the test facility system response. Any deviations in the system response should be investigated. Critical control system response data, such as the transfer function or inverse transfer functions and calculated drive voltage, must be evaluated real-time during vibration testing, but before application of the sine-burst to ensure that they are reasonable and do not indicate system maladies. A vibration facility validation test should be done for each planned test series that is representative of the actual test conditions before flight or critical hardware is mounted. Use of a simulated mass consistent with that of the test article is always recommended for spacecraft system level testing. Other flight equipment validation testing should be considered based on mass and criticality. Self-checks should be done that provide a representative response for the forcing range of the planned test. For higher force shock tests, shaker systems and test fixtures often do not respond in a linear fashion. It is also foolhardy to assume that test facilities are always in perfect working order. All test requirements should be defined in the test plan for a particular test. The test operators must have adequate data and training to ensure complete verification testing before testing critical hardware.","Lesson ID":903}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Nonpractice of deterministic fracture mechanics analysis (or test) in a spacecraft or launch vehicle program would result in the failure to meet NASA design requirements for fracture control [references 11 and 12]. Failure to adequately consider fatigue in the design of structural and mechanical components subject to fluctuating loads may, at best, result in recurring costs for repair or replacement of components before their intended design life. At worst, a catastrophic failure, in terms of economic loss and loss of life, may result. It is standard JSC engineering practice to specify fracture control requirements on structural and mechanical components that are classified as fracture critical. As a part of these requirements, it is required that a component be shown by analysis or test to be able to survive a deterministic minimum number of service lifetimes (usually 4) without the largest possible undetectable flaw growing to failure [references 11 and 12]. While this process has proven to be adequate to ensure against failure, design practices which do not take advantage of stochastic methods for fracture analysis may produce over-conservative and uneconomical structures and mechanisms. In mechanical or structural system reliability analyses, failure to use a stochastic fatigue or fracture mechanics approach to the estimation of reliability will result in life estimates that are incompatible and inconsistent with the results of the standard NASA deterministic safe-life analyses required by the Space Shuttle and Space Station Programs [references 11 and 12].","Lesson ID":700}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Board found that the loss of the Lewis Spacecraft was the direct result of an implementation of a technically flawed Safe Mode in the Attitude Control System. This error was made fatal to the spacecraft by the reliance on that unproven Safe Mode by the on orbit operations team and by the failure to adequately monitor spacecraft health and safety during the critical initial mission phase. The Board also discovered numerous other factors that contributed to the environment that allowed the direct causes to occur. While the direct causes were the most visible reasons for the failure, the Board believes that the indirect causes were also very significant contributors. Many of these factors can be attributed to a lack of a mutual understanding between the contractor and the Government as to what is meant by Faster, Better, Cheaper. These indirect contributors are to be taken in the context of implementing a program in the Faster, Better, Cheaper mode: Requirement changes without adequate resource adjustment Cost and schedule pressures Program Office move Inadequate ground station availability for initial operations Frequent key personnel changes Inadequate engineering discipline Inadequate management discipline The Board strongly endorses the concept of \"Faster, Better, Cheaper\" in space programs and believes that this paradigm can be successfully implemented with sound engineering, and attentive, and effective management. However the role changes for Government and Industry are significant and must be acknowledged, planned for and maintained throughout the program.Since these roles are fundamental changes in how business is conducted, they must be recognized by all team members and behaviors adjusted at all levels.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"OSP took many proactive management steps to increase our emphasis on safety. However, just below the surface significant flaws existed in our implementation approach resulting in a misunderstanding of the S&MA organizational authority. With the program acceleration, the quality of the safety products was further compromised by abandoning established requirements, processes, tools, and standards of performance. The intent was to catch up on the safety products at SDR and beyond; however, safety is most effective when woven into the fabric of all organizational elements from the start of a program. Additionally: a. S&MA Leadership. Throughout the life of the program, it appeared that OSP S&MA inclusion in management decisions and leadership was ineffective. A misunderstanding in S&MA leadership was created by the presence of a senior S&MA expert (former S&MA employee) on the Program staff, reporting to the Program Manager. His role was to ensure internal Program implementation of and compliance with S&MA requirements and provide a working level interface with the assigned independent S&MA representatives. It now appears that this arrangement somehow gave the impression of diminishing the role of the separately assigned, independent S&MA representatives. b. De-emphasizing S&MA Products. At the Systems Requirements Review (SRR), S&MA products were de-emphasized as a contract deliverable due to acceleration. These same products were not part of the formal review at the SDR for baselining (only comments were allowed); therefore, these S&MA documents did not go through a thorough review and feedback process. The \u201ccatch-up\u201d desired never materialized, and as a result, the normal safety products expected at SDR were deficient. c. S&MA Requirements. Adequate S&MA requirements were not contained in the Level 2 requirements document, and insufficient attention was paid to S&MA data requirements in the contracts. The Program placed so much emphasis on the HRR that we overlooked many, equally important S&MA requirements. d. Level 3 and Level 4 S&MA Requirements Development. Given the inadequate Level 2 S&MA requirements, the Contractors' were unable to develop appropriate Level 3 and 4 S&MA requirements. e. Incomplete Understanding. NASA should not assume the Contractor workforce understands the Government's human space flight expectations.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Considerations when installing fiber optics in spacecraft: Vibration in the Launch environment can cause cracks and spalls on fiber endfaces to propagate. Sharp edges or corners could damage fiber cable jacket. Movement of improperly secured fiber optic harnesses. Contamination on fiber endfaces will migrate more readily in microgravity when demating and mating connectors. At KSC, we developed expertise in: pre-installation testing, handling, routing and securing, inspection, cleaning and acceptance. Pre-Installation Testing - Fiber endfaces should be inspected post-fabrication to verify proper polishing. - Fiber links should be tested to verify acceptable optical performance Handling - Care must be taken to prevent damage to fiber optic cable assemblies during the installation process. - Use Caution when handling to avoid violating the minimum bend radius of the fiber. - Fiber optic cables should only be handled and installed by trained and certified fiber optic personnel. Routing and Securing - Fiber optic cable assemblies should not be combined in the same wiring bundle as wire or coaxial cable assemblies. - The minimum bend radius shall not be less than 10 times the cable diameter unless specified on the engineering documentation. - For installation, fiber optic cable assemblies shall be tied at least once every 20cm (8 in), or per the engineering documentation. - The minimum bend radius shall not be violated at connector backshells. - Tie downs shall be tight enough to capture the fiber optic cable but shall not deform the cable outer jacket. The ties shall not pinch, deform, kink, or otherwise stress the cable assembly. - Fiber optic cable assemblies shall not be routed over sharp edges or corners unless appropriate protection is provided.","Lesson ID":1876}
{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Foundational documents, critical for the initial planning and subsequent control of project activities, should be developed and widely distributed, published and advertised to the team early in the process. For projects limited in manpower and financial resources, these foundational documents will be equally limited in their complexity, but they should exist from the beginning of the project to provide guidance to the entire team. A clear flight certification process is needed for COTS hardware. Qualification requirements for all disciplines need to be clearly and explicitly stated up front. The approval process for changes can burden the flow of work with unnecessary steps if it is not tailored to the size, scope, and complexity of the project. Approval process for changes should be agreed to at the beginning of the project in line with configuration management for the size and scope of the project. Wise use of analyses and evaluation of interfaces at all stages of the life cycle can save time and resource expenditures during build, test, and milestone reviews. During any design, development, integration and test project that has a compressed schedule, it is essential for the team to communicate to avoid having the hardware wait for the next step in the process. Coordination is needed between MSFC and JSC Export Control offices. Seek out local (MSFC) help with database inputs before going to JSC for help. A payload with a normal schedule, would not have the issues with parts lists, Interface Control Document (ICD), manifest requests, and LRODS that we had on ISERV. Parallel development of the products is very difficult and fraught with potential mistakes. Check internally to see if another project, such as Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG), might have experience with the system\/database. Using COTS equipment, while faster to procure, requires extra testing and communication to ensure it meets standards, which must be factored into the schedule. To meet implied requirements, minimum NASA standards must be met, which implies additional quality engineering support, specific test requirements, and part traceability. It is a good idea to get S&MA involved up front, even if only to understand the qualification requirements that may be encountered when the hardware needs to be integrated into the higher class system. If too many assumptions about the plug-and-play nature of the equipment and supporting hardware are made up front, the team will spend more hours reiterating design and testing activities. Assuming that COTS is faster and cheaper without understanding the implied requirements unnecessarily increases the risk of not meeting schedule, budget, and delivery agreements.","Lesson ID":7217}

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"Failure of the bridge operator to follow the approved procedure, which requires verification that the Zero-G System is not hooked up prior to bridge movement and assignment of an observer, was the major contributing cause of this mishap. The second contributing cause involved multiple deficient control systems to preclude bridge operation while connected to the Zero-G Simulator. Supervisory control of the bridge power key was nonexistent, allowing technicians free access to bridge keys. Procedural steps included in Operations and Maintenance Instruction (OMI) V3575 to tag the bridge\/bucket system out of service and secure the key during Zero-G operations were not referenced in the OMI V9023 that configured the PLBD and Zero-G System for PLBD operations. Shift tie-in from the third shift Mechanical\/Electrical\/TCS Supervisor to the first shift Electrical\/TCS Supervisor did not occur. In addition, the first shift Electrical\/TCS Supervisor was not aware of the scheduled PLBD operations status nor did he perform a complete walkdown. Therefore, the supervisor assigning work requiring bridge operations was not aware the Zero-G System was connected. The work assigned to the bridge operator involved in this mishap did not appear either on the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) shop schedule or the KSC Integrated Contractor Schedule (KICS). Had this work been properly integrated into the KICS schedule, work involving bridge movement would have been scheduled to occur after use of the Zero-G Simulator was complete. The third contributing cause is attributed to this lack of integrated scheduling.

{"Lesson(s) Learned":"The Review Committee concluded that the primary cause for this incident was that the Range Safety abort was rescinded without on net authority and range awareness. The principal contributing factors to this incident were the off net communications; and confusion that resulted from having two separate operational nets, the lack of sufficiently detailed and attended prelaunch briefings, and the lengthy process of communicating with the B-52. The Review Committee during its investigation has compiled a list of findings and conclusions. They have been grouped in the following categories: Abort Process Mission Rules Communications Launch Day Roles and Responsibilities Mission Planning and Preparation ABORT PROCESS FINDINGS An abort was initiated by the WFF\/RSO, the abort was rescinded by the contractor TC without on net authority and range awareness. The B-52 was required to reduce altitude just prior to the CDR dropout abort call. WFF, Eastern Range (ER), Merritt Island Tracking Station (MILA) and Bermuda Tracking Station (BDA) responded in a manner which allowed continued flight of the Pegasus after launch There was no procedure in the WFF\/OSD or the Contractor Launch Checklist (LC) that detailed the procedure for rescinding an abort. CONCLUSIONS From the above findings, the Committee reached the following conclusions: The contractor TC method of rescinding the abort was inadequate. Fin battery actuation was a consideration in the decision to rescind the abort. The altitude problem may have contributed to the confusion concerning the abort. Capability to destruct the Pegasus was maintained throughout the flight. Quick positive reaction by all supporting personnel allowed this flight to continue to a successful conclusion. MISSION RULES FINDINGS An apparent dropout of a Flight Termination System (FTS) CDR occurred. This apparent dropout required an abort of the launch according to the mission rules. Not all key personnel were aware of all mission rules. Additionally, in some cases, key personnel had different interpretations of mission rules. CONCLUSIONS There were misunderstandings among key personnel concerning the mission rules. Lack of awareness and misinterpretation of mission rules may have contributed to this incident. The FTS CDR dropout mission rule produced a high risk of mission abort. The complex routing of the data stream (vehicle\/aircraft to ground, ground to Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) satellite, satellite to ground) and the amount of support equipment necessary to provide this data (decoms, bit syncs, cabling) produced a high probability of data loss not related to CDR health. COMMUNICATIONS FINDINGS No single Intercom Channel (IC) was understood by all key participants as the primary launch net. The WFF\/RSO chain of communication to the B-52 required 3 intermediaries. The configuration of communication equipment used by NASA 1 and the contractor TC was operationally awkward. Formal intercom net protocol was not consistently used. CONCLUSIONS The lack of a single IC for all critical calls that was monitored by all key personnel contributed to confusion and to the range's lack of knowledge of impending launch. The chain of communication between the WFF\/RSO and the B-52 contained too many elements. Improved intercom net discipline may have prevented misunderstandings leading to the unplanned launch. The contractor TC had expected to receive Range abort calls from the WFF\/RCO on IC 4. The fact that the abort was only transmitted on IC 1 by the WFF\/TD and heard off net by the contractor TC caused the contractor TC to question the abort call and delayed the passing of the abort to the B-52. LAUNCH DAY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FINDINGS There were no clear lines of authority and responsibility for launch decisions. The OSC\/TC rescinded the abort command without proper on net authority and range awareness. CONCLUSIONS The primary cause of this incident was that the OSC\/TC rescinded the abort without on net authority and range awareness. The lack of clear lines of authority and responsibility contributed to his\/her actions. The limited abort scenarios exercised during the dress rehearsal were not sufficient to identify all authority and responsibility conflicts. MISSION PLANNING AND PREPARATION FINDINGS No pre-launch briefing was held at which all key participants reviewed mission rules, constraints, and procedures. The WFF\/Operations and Safety Directive (OSD) and the Contractor's Launch Operations and Mission Constraints (LOMC) document contained conflicting information that was not completely integrated in the mission planning process. A complete dress rehearsal was not conducted for this mission. CONCLUSIONS The pre-mission planning and preparation process was inadequate for a mission of the scope and complexity of the Pegasus \/ SCD-1 launch. Conflicting Information in the various organizations' documentation may have contributed to this incident. The lack of a pre-mission briefing attended by all organizations that reviewed roles, responsibilities, mission rules\/constraints, IC assignments, and the launch decision process contributed to this incident.","Lesson ID":1090}

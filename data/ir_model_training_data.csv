0,why did the air ducts fail on a jet stream,"The failure of the No. 3 bleed air duct due to corrosion, which resulted in numerous system failures and the pilot’s inability to maintain directional control during the landing roll.
 During the final leg of a cross-country flight, the flight crew heard a loud popping noise and a loud bang. Simultaneously, the torque gauges provided unusual and fluctuating readings. A crew member in the cargo compartment announced misting hydraulic fluid mixed with smoke. The crew donned their supplemental oxygen and the cockpit crew turned off the bleed air from the four engines. The crew subsequently diverted to a nearby airport and trouble shot multiple anomalies, including engine fire warning lights from the N0s. 3 and 4 engines and the loss of normal hydraulic pressure. The captain elected to feather the No. 4 engine but did not shut down the No. 3 engine at that time to retain three-engine performance. During landing, the captain was unable to maintain directional control and the airplane departed the runway. The captain then intentionally ground looped the airplane to avoid hitting the main terminal building and airplanes that were parked on the ramp. The airplane undercarriage, right wing, and nose area were substantially damaged.
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the No. 3 bleed air duct had failed. Further examination of the bleed air duct revealed stress corrosion cracking preceded by corrosion pitting on the interior surfaces. The microscopic features observed were consistent with pre-existing cracking prior to the final circumferential fracture of the duct. When the duct failed due to corrosion, hot air was directed onto surrounding electrical wires and hydraulic lines, which subsequently resulted in numerous system failures. The captain was subsequently unable to maintain directional control during the landing roll.

2,what caused a trunnion pin in a plane to fail,"Maintenance personnel’s excessive grinding of the left main landing gear’s aft trunnion pin during its initial overhaul, which caused heat damage to the base metal and led to the fatigue crack that caused the pin to fail during the accident flight. Contributing to the accident was the failure of maintenance personnel to detect the excessive grinding during the initial overhaul and the fatigue crack during the subsequent overhaul. 
 This accident occurred when the left main landing gear of a United Airlines Boeing 737-800 collapsed during the landing roll. Both flight crewmembers reported that the airplane had touched down smoothly on the runway centerline, but the first officer reported that he then felt the airplane “shudder” and tilt left wing down. The first officer further reported that, as the airplane continued to decelerate, he struggled to keep the airplane on the runway centerline. Visual meteorological conditions and a headwind were present when the airplane landed, so the weather did not play a role in the accident circumstances. 
Postaccident examination found that the aft trunnion pin in the left main landing gear failed during the landing due to a fatigue crack. The crack, which had grown to a depth of 0.154 inches, was large enough that stress concentration at the crack tip (from loads during the landing) caused the pin to fracture, resulting in the collapse of the left main landing gear. 
The fatigue crack initiated from a small intergranular region just below the external chromium electroplated layer. The size of the intergranular region was about 0.011 inches deep and 0.074 inches wide. Multiple fatigue cracks had initiated from this intergranular region. These individual cracks coalesced and propagated inward, as shown by ratchet marks and fatigue striations. 
Etching showed that the intergranular region where the fatigue crack initiated was located along an area exhibiting a darker visual contrast. This characteristic was consistent with overtempering and an area of localized exposure to higher temperatures relative to the alloy steel material of the pin outside this area. The most likely cause of this elevated heat input was excessive grinding performed during maintenance overhaul of the pin. Any grinding operation introduces the risk of a local microstructure change, but over-tempering indicates hard or excessive grinding involving temperatures that are high enough to change the steel material’s microstructure.
According to United Airlines, the pin had accumulated 23,535 landing cycles since entering service in November 1998. The first overhaul occurred in May 2008 when the pin had accumulated 10,613 cycles; the second overhaul occurred in December 2017 when the pin had accumulated 21,226 cycles. 
A fatigue crack analysis showed that the thumbnail crack had been present for at least 6,225 landing cycles. Between the time of the last overhaul (December 2017) and the accident, the pin had accumulated 2,309 landing cycles, and the pin had accumulated 12,922 landing cycles between the earlier overhaul (May 2008) and the accident. Therefore, the crack was present before the December 2017 overhaul but was likely not present before the May 2008 overhaul.
According to the work order for the last trunnion pin overhaul, which was completed on December 28, 2017, the chromium layer had not been stripped from the trunnion pin before the cadmium electroplating process. Postaccident testing performed at Boeing on the accident pin demonstrated that the underlying cracks could not be detected by magnetic particle inspection when the chromium electroplating layer was present. Fluorescent penetrant inspection was also performed with no indications noted.
The earlier overhaul, which was completed on May 23, 2008, included grinding of the trunnion pin surface, first to remove the old chromium electroplating layer and then after the new chromium layer had been electroplated on the trunnion pin. Because grinding steps were performed during this overhaul, the over-tempering of the pin most likely occurred at that time. 
The investigation determined that the bare trunnion pin was not inspected after the chromium electroplating layer was stripped. According to information from the May 2008 overhaul provider, the company performs a visual inspection, temper etch, and magnetic particle inspection after stripping and machining the pin (before shot peening). The investigation could not determine why these inspections were not performed on the pin. A temper etch on the bare pin should have revealed an area of excessive grinding, which would have prevented the part from progressing through the overhaul and being placed back into service. 
In summary, the grinding operation on the trunnion pin that occurred during the May 2008 overhaul created heat damage and areas of over-tempering to the base alloy steel material. No inspection was performed to detect the excessive grinding, so the trunnion pin was returned to service with the crack undetected under the chromium electroplating layer, and the crack continued to grow for about 4,150 cycles, progressing to a depth of 0.105 inches.

In addition, elevated temperatures during the baking steps of the May 2008 overhaul led to the initial heat tinting oxidation, which caused the initial discoloration of a portion of the crack. The nondestructive inspections of the pin during the subsequent overhaul in December 2017 revealed no indications of base metal cracking under the external chromium layer, and the overhaul processes subjected the pin to multiple elevated temperature exposures. These exposures induced additional heat tinting oxidation on the crack surface that had grown since the first overhaul. The pin was returned to service, and the fatigue crack propagated over 2,309 flight cycles (after the December 2017 overhaul) until the final fracture occurred during the accident landing due to ductile separation. The final depth of the fatigue crack was 0.154 inches. This portion of the slow growth region did not exhibit discoloration or heat tinting because there had been no elevated temperatures exposures after the December 2017 overhaul.

This portion of the slow growth region did not exhibit discoloration or heat tinting because there had been no elevated temperatures exposures after the December 2017 overhaul. 
 Maintenance personnel’s excessive grinding of the left main landing gear’s aft trunnion pin during its initial overhaul, which caused heat damage to the base metal and led to the fatigue crack that caused the pin to fail during the accident flight. Contributing to the accident was the failure of maintenance personnel to detect the excessive grinding during the initial overhaul and the fatigue crack during the subsequent overhaul. 
. This accident occurred when the left main landing gear of a United Airlines Boeing 737-800 collapsed during the landing roll. Both flight crewmembers reported that the airplane had touched down smoothly on the runway centerline, but the first officer reported that he then felt the airplane “shudder” and tilt left wing down. The first officer further reported that, as the airplane continued to decelerate, he struggled to keep the airplane on the runway centerline. Visual meteorological conditions and a headwind were present when the airplane landed, so the weather did not play a role in the accident circumstances. 
Postaccident examination found that the aft trunnion pin in the left main landing gear failed during the landing due to a fatigue crack. The crack, which had grown to a depth of 0.154 inches, was large enough that stress concentration at the crack tip (from loads during the landing) caused the pin to fracture, resulting in the collapse of the left main landing gear. 
The fatigue crack initiated from a small intergranular region just below the external chromium electroplated layer. The size of the intergranular region was about 0.011 inches deep and 0.074 inches wide. Multiple fatigue cracks had initiated from this intergranular region. These individual cracks coalesced and propagated inward, as shown by ratchet marks and fatigue striations. 
Etching showed that the intergranular region where the fatigue crack initiated was located along an area exhibiting a darker visual contrast. This characteristic was consistent with overtempering and an area of localized exposure to higher temperatures relative to the alloy steel material of the pin outside this area. The most likely cause of this elevated heat input was excessive grinding performed during maintenance overhaul of the pin. Any grinding operation introduces the risk of a local microstructure change, but over-tempering indicates hard or excessive grinding involving temperatures that are high enough to change the steel material’s microstructure.
According to United Airlines, the pin had accumulated 23,535 landing cycles since entering service in November 1998. The first overhaul occurred in May 2008 when the pin had accumulated 10,613 cycles; the second overhaul occurred in December 2017 when the pin had accumulated 21,226 cycles. 
A fatigue crack analysis showed that the thumbnail crack had been present for at least 6,225 landing cycles. Between the time of the last overhaul (December 2017) and the accident, the pin had accumulated 2,309 landing cycles, and the pin had accumulated 12,922 landing cycles between the earlier overhaul (May 2008) and the accident. Therefore, the crack was present before the December 2017 overhaul but was likely not present before the May 2008 overhaul.
According to the work order for the last trunnion pin overhaul, which was completed on December 28, 2017, the chromium layer had not been stripped from the trunnion pin before the cadmium electroplating process. Postaccident testing performed at Boeing on the accident pin demonstrated that the underlying cracks could not be detected by magnetic particle inspection when the chromium electroplating layer was present. Fluorescent penetrant inspection was also performed with no indications noted.
The earlier overhaul, which was completed on May 23, 2008, included grinding of the trunnion pin surface, first to remove the old chromium electroplating layer and then after the new chromium layer had been electroplated on the trunnion pin. Because grinding steps were performed during this overhaul, the over-tempering of the pin most likely occurred at that time. 
The investigation determined that the bare trunnion pin was not inspected after the chromium electroplating layer was stripped. According to information from the May 2008 overhaul provider, the company performs a visual inspection, temper etch, and magnetic particle inspection after stripping and machining the pin (before shot peening). The investigation could not determine why these inspections were not performed on the pin. A temper etch on the bare pin should have revealed an area of excessive grinding, which would have prevented the part from progressing through the overhaul and being placed back into service. 
In summary, the grinding operation on the trunnion pin that occurred during the May 2008 overhaul created heat damage and areas of over-tempering to the base alloy steel material. No inspection was performed to detect the excessive grinding, so the trunnion pin was returned to service with the crack undetected under the chromium electroplating layer, and the crack continued to grow for about 4,150 cycles, progressing to a depth of 0.105 inches.

In addition, elevated temperatures during the baking steps of the May 2008 overhaul led to the initial heat tinting oxidation, which caused the initial discoloration of a portion of the crack. The nondestructive inspections of the pin during the subsequent overhaul in December 2017 revealed no indications of base metal cracking under the external chromium layer, and the overhaul processes subjected the pin to multiple elevated temperature exposures. These exposures induced additional heat tinting oxidation on the crack surface that had grown since the first overhaul. The pin was returned to service, and the fatigue crack propagated over 2,309 flight cycles (after the December 2017 overhaul) until the final fracture occurred during the accident landing due to ductile separation. The final depth of the fatigue crack was 0.154 inches. This portion of the slow growth region did not exhibit discoloration or heat tinting because there had been no elevated temperatures exposures after the December 2017 overhaul.

6,what does gcu stand for in an airplane?,"A worn component within each engine integrated drive generator (IDG) resulted in the loss of electrical power supplied to several flight deck displays and systems while on approach to landing.  The component, a fixed cylinder block, had significant wearing of its reworked brass liners resulting in the IDGs producing a frequency output outside of their specified design limit.
 This incident occurred when a Spirit Airlines Airbus A319 experienced a fault with both engine integrated drive generators (IDG) while on approach to the Sacramento International Airport (SMF), Sacramento, California.  These faults resulted in the loss of electrical power supplied to both electrical networks (AC BUS 1 and AC BUS 2) leading to the loss of several flight deck displays and systems.  Upon the dual loss of power, the ram air turbine (RAT) automatically extended and began driving the emergency generator to provide electrical power to vital services.  The airplane landed without further incident, was towed to the gate and passengers deplaned normally.   

A review of the airplane’s maintenance records found that the airplane had experienced a similar dual loss of power event during an approach into the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport (KALT), Atlanta, Georgia on the previous day.  The airplane had also experienced a similar loss of power on three different occasions on ground while performing single engine taxi after landing in January 2020.

Each engine’s IDG was controlled by an independent digital computer called a generator control unit (GCU).  One of its functions was to protect the IDG and its associated electrical network by monitoring and controlling the frequency and voltage output of its respected IDG.  When the GCU detects a fault, it will isolate the IDG from the electrical network, and store the system fault data in its non-volatile memory (NVM).  An amber fault message will also illuminate on the respective generator control push button switch indicating the channel is offline.

Post incident analysis of information from the airplane’s GCU revealed that during the incident flight and during the dual loss of power event that occurred on the previous day, both GCU’s recorded fault code 145.  This information indicates that the frequency output for both the left and the right engine IDGs were outside of their specified design limits during the incident flight and on the previous day.  Analysis of the data also revealed a similar out of limit frequency output from the left engine IDG when the airplane experienced the three loss of power events in January.

Examination and testing of the left engine IDG revealed that an internal component, a fixed cylinder block, was significantly worn beyond its design limits. Wear was observed in the gold-colored liners assembled inside of the bores of the cylinder block.  The wear was uneven around the circumference and occurred close to either end of the bores, with the heaviest wear extending up from the bottom of the bores. The gold-colored liners were worn through in some areas in several bores, and silver-colored base metal was visible.  The fixed cylinder block and pistons within IDG1 were replaced with serviceable original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts and the IDG was re-tested.  The IDG passed its tests indicating that the wear on the fixed cylinder block and pistons was the reason for the IDG failure during the event flight.

Examination of IDG2 revealed that only one of the cylinder bores of the fixed cylinder block was worn through in a similar fashion to the cylinder block from IDG1.  Although testing of this IDG found that it exhibited a significant frequency modulation on its electrical output, the output was not outside of its specified design limit and therefore would not have triggered a fault code 145 to be recorded on the GCU.  Nevertheless, several tests showed that the fault code 145 was almost triggered under the following test conditions: 1) A constant speed (or a slow sweep profile) between 6,100 RPM and 6,150 RPM, 2) A high IDG load that seems to increase slightly with the modulation amplitude.

Although Spirit Airlines maintenance had performed troubleshooting on the airplane after each of the previous loss of electrical power events, they were unable to determine any faults with the electrical system, including the IDGs.  A review of their maintenance records found that the testing included a run-up of the engines to check electrical loads per their aircraft maintenance manual (AMM), and operational testing of the IDGs.  According to Airbus, the introduction section of their A318/A319/A320/A321 troubleshooting manual (TSM) indicated that if an operator cannot find a fault symptom and/or fault isolation procedure necessary to ensure the continued airworthiness of the aircraft they should contact Airbus.  Airbus indicated that they were not contacted by Spirit Airlines for assistance on these loss of electrical power events.  It is likely that if Spirt Airlines maintenance had contacted Airbus for these loss of electrical power events, they may have identified fault code 145 on the Number 1 GCU and replaced its respective IDG prior to the February 15th event.  
As a result of this incident, Airbus has improved their TSM by incorporating steps to direct maintenance towards a direct extraction of the post flight report (PFR) and troubleshooting data (TSD) from the GCUs.

The gold-colored liners were worn through in some areas in several bores, and silver-colored base metal was visible.  The fixed cylinder block and pistons within IDG1 were replaced with serviceable original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts and the IDG was re-tested.  The IDG passed its tests indicating that the wear on the fixed cylinder block and pistons was the reason for the IDG failure during the event flight.

Examination of IDG2 revealed that only one of the cylinder bores of the fixed cylinder block was worn through in a similar fashion to the cylinder block from IDG1.  Although testing of this IDG found that it exhibited a significant frequency modulation on its electrical output, the output was not outside of its specified design limit and therefore would not have triggered a fault code 145 to be recorded on the GCU.  Nevertheless, several tests showed that the fault code 145 was almost triggered under the following test conditions: 1) A constant speed (or a slow sweep profile) between 6,100 RPM and 6,150 RPM, 2) A high IDG load that seems to increase slightly with the modulation amplitude.

Although Spirit Airlines maintenance had performed troubleshooting on the airplane after each of the previous loss of electrical power events, they were unable to determine any faults with the electrical system, including the IDGs.  A review of their maintenance records found that the testing included a run-up of the engines to check electrical loads per their aircraft maintenance manual (AMM), and operational testing of the IDGs.  According to Airbus, the introduction section of their A318/A319/A320/A321 troubleshooting manual (TSM) indicated that if an operator cannot find a fault symptom and/or fault isolation procedure necessary to ensure the continued airworthiness of the aircraft they should contact Airbus.  Airbus indicated that they were not contacted by Spirit Airlines for assistance on these loss of electrical power events.  It is likely that if Spirt Airlines maintenance had contacted Airbus for these loss of electrical power events, they may have identified fault code 145 on the Number 1 GCU and replaced its respective IDG prior to the February 15th event.  
As a result of this incident, Airbus has improved their TSM by incorporating steps to direct maintenance towards a direct extraction of the post flight report (PFR) and troubleshooting data (TSD) from the GCUs.

8,what causes a single engine airplane to lose power,"A worn component within each engine integrated drive generator (IDG) resulted in the loss of electrical power supplied to several flight deck displays and systems while on approach to landing.  The component, a fixed cylinder block, had significant wearing of its reworked brass liners resulting in the IDGs producing a frequency output outside of their specified design limit.
 This incident occurred when a Spirit Airlines Airbus A319 experienced a fault with both engine integrated drive generators (IDG) while on approach to the Sacramento International Airport (SMF), Sacramento, California.  These faults resulted in the loss of electrical power supplied to both electrical networks (AC BUS 1 and AC BUS 2) leading to the loss of several flight deck displays and systems.  Upon the dual loss of power, the ram air turbine (RAT) automatically extended and began driving the emergency generator to provide electrical power to vital services.  The airplane landed without further incident, was towed to the gate and passengers deplaned normally.   

A review of the airplane’s maintenance records found that the airplane had experienced a similar dual loss of power event during an approach into the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport (KALT), Atlanta, Georgia on the previous day.  The airplane had also experienced a similar loss of power on three different occasions on ground while performing single engine taxi after landing in January 2020.

Each engine’s IDG was controlled by an independent digital computer called a generator control unit (GCU).  One of its functions was to protect the IDG and its associated electrical network by monitoring and controlling the frequency and voltage output of its respected IDG.  When the GCU detects a fault, it will isolate the IDG from the electrical network, and store the system fault data in its non-volatile memory (NVM).  An amber fault message will also illuminate on the respective generator control push button switch indicating the channel is offline.

Post incident analysis of information from the airplane’s GCU revealed that during the incident flight and during the dual loss of power event that occurred on the previous day, both GCU’s recorded fault code 145.  This information indicates that the frequency output for both the left and the right engine IDGs were outside of their specified design limits during the incident flight and on the previous day.  Analysis of the data also revealed a similar out of limit frequency output from the left engine IDG when the airplane experienced the three loss of power events in January.

Examination and testing of the left engine IDG revealed that an internal component, a fixed cylinder block, was significantly worn beyond its design limits. Wear was observed in the gold-colored liners assembled inside of the bores of the cylinder block.  The wear was uneven around the circumference and occurred close to either end of the bores, with the heaviest wear extending up from the bottom of the bores. The gold-colored liners were worn through in some areas in several bores, and silver-colored base metal was visible.  The fixed cylinder block and pistons within IDG1 were replaced with serviceable original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts and the IDG was re-tested.  The IDG passed its tests indicating that the wear on the fixed cylinder block and pistons was the reason for the IDG failure during the event flight.

The pilot was unable to maintain altitude and performed a forced landing to a highway. The airplane was substantially damaged during the landing.
Postaccident examination of the airplane’s fuel system revealed the main tank, which was gravity-fed from the aft fuel tank, was intact and empty of fuel. About 3.5 gallons of fuel was emptied from the aft tank. When fuel was added to the main tank, fuel was immediately observed to be leaking from the lower left-hand seam of the tank. Blue fuel stains were also observed around the area of the leak.
The accident is consistent with the engine losing power due to fuel starvation as a result of a leak in the main fuel tank.

18,what is the cause of a fire in an airplane,"A total loss of engine power due to oil starvation.
 The pilot was on a cross-county flight back to his home airport. About an hour into the flight, a witness standing in her front yard, heard the airplane flying overhead and heard the engine “popping” like it was back firing. She looked up at the airplane and saw that it was “very low,” at an estimated altitude of 500 ft above ground level. The airplane disappeared behind trees and she heard the airplane hitting tree branches shortly afterward. 

Examination of the airplane revealed that the fuselage and instrument panel was consumed by fire. Smoke striations from the cowling into the cockpit were consistent with an in-flight fire that originated in the engine compartment. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the flight controls to the flight control surfaces.  A large hole was observed at the No. 2 cylinder case half and all of the connecting rod bearings were worn and oil starved. The No. 2 connecting rod was the most worn and the rod and cap exhibited lubrication distress. The condition of the No. 2 connecting rod bearing indicated that it was closest to the initiation point of oil starvation. However, a reason for the oil starvation could not be determined. It is likely that the inflight fire was the result of the engine failure.

Autopsy of the pilot indicated that he had cardiomegaly and moderate atherosclerotic disease. While these conditions increase the risk for having a sudden cardiac event, there was no evidence of any acute processes on autopsy and the pilot was able to extricate himself from the plane. Thus, it is unlikely that the pilot’s cardiovascular condition was a factor in this accident.

Carboxyhemoglobin was detected in the pilot’s blood at 15-16% and soot material was found in his airways. Toxicology testing detected cyanide, which can be produced by combustion, in his blood. Inhalation of both elements would have occurred from the in-flight fire. That the pilot extricated himself from the airplane suggests that the carbon monoxide itself was not impairing. Thus, carbon monoxide exposure, as determined by the carboxyhemoglobin level, was not a contributing factor in the accident.

 The student pilot reported that he had just departed a grass strip when the wing of the airplane dropped and contacted a power line. The student pilot lost control of the airplane and it collided with terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and the empennage. No preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane were reported that would have precluded normal operation. Prior to the accident, the student pilot reported that a gust of wind had made the airplane’s wing drop, however a review of weather information found the prevailing wind to be calm.

92,what caused the pilot to sink and then overfly,"The glider’s encounter with atmospheric conditions where the lift was not sufficient to maintain flight. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s decision to overfly a suitable landing site which resulted in an off-field landing in a lake.
 The pilot reported he was soaring when he penetrated two areas of “heavy sink” before reaching the final wave lift of the flight that took him to 16,500 ft.  When he left the wave lift the glider began to sink and he quickly focused on regaining lift and did not think about the final glide back to the departure airport. The pilot subsequently overflew a suitable alternative airport as he continued to search for lift while the glider continued to sink at about 1,000 ft per minute. The pilot eventually maneuvered into a position where his best option was to land in a lake when he could not find sufficient lift or return to an airport. Both wings were substantially damaged when the pilot landed in the lake. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the glider that would have precluded normal operation.

96,where did the student pilot stall,"The student pilot’s failure to maintain airspeed and yaw control of the airplane during an aborted takeoff, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and impact with the ground. 
 The student pilot reported that he intended to depart the airport to the southeast. He stated that the airplane accelerated, and rotated at 55 kts, after which he did not notice an increase in altitude or airspeed. He then ""brought the airplane to a neutral configuration to build airspeed.” The airplane yawed and when it was about 45° from runway heading the student pilot reduced power and attempted to land. He noted that he still had right rudder input for takeoff, and this induced a hard right turn. The right wing stalled, and the airplane impacted on the right landing gear. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the forward fuselage. The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

The airplane became airborne again, but at the top of the bounce, the pilot felt the right wing rapidly dip and he applied left aileron to correct it.  The right-wing started to rise, but before it leveled off, he heard it contact the corn. The airplane spun to the right and landed in the corn field, resulting in substantial damage to aft fuselage and empennage. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

 The pilot reported that while on final approach, the airplane was “high”, so he pulled off power to lose altitude and reduce airspeed. As the airplane was nearing the runway, the airplane entered an inadvertent aerodynamic stall. The stall horn sounded as the airplane pitched up, and the left wing lost lift. The airplane collided with terrain in a left-wing low attitude. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and fuselage. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failure with the airplane that would have precluded normal operations.

On the fourth and final landing, they set up a steep approach with the student pilot on the flight controls. The helicopter was above the effective translational lift (ETL) airspeed as they descended through 100 ft above ground level (agl) in a stabilized descent. The helicopter then started to yaw left and the flight instructor took the controls. As the spin rate increased, the flight instructor’s efforts to regain control were not successful. He then realized the helicopter was spinning out of control. He lowered the collective and the spin rate slowed as the helicopter contacted the ground.

On the fourth and final landing, they set up a steep approach with the student pilot on the flight controls. The helicopter was above the effective translational lift (ETL) airspeed as they descended through 100 ft above ground level (agl) in a stabilized descent. The helicopter then started to yaw left and the flight instructor took the controls. As the spin rate increased, the flight instructor’s efforts to regain control were not successful. He then realized the helicopter was spinning out of control. He lowered the collective and the spin rate slowed as the helicopter contacted the ground. The flight instructor shut down the engine and both pilots exited the helicopter. The helicopter’s fuselage sustained substantial damage.  The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident failures or malfunctions with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operations.

348,what type of damage does a plane sustain after landing,"The pilot’s decision to depart on inadequate runway surface conditions that resulted in a loss of control after attempting to abort the takeoff, a runway excursion, and a nose over.
 The pilot reported that after landing, he planned to make an immediate departure. During the takeoff roll, about halfway down the turf runway, the airplane traveled over “rough runway conditions” and bounced several times. The pilot assessed the situation and decided to abort the takeoff. Due to the rough surface and the constant bouncing of the airplane, the pilot was unable to stop the airplane before it departed the runway. The airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, and the pilot was able to egress from the airplane without further incident. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing, the left wing strut, and the vertical stabilizer. The pilot reported there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe and the engine that would have precluded normal operation.

The first two landings were uneventful, and they had planned for the third to be a full stop with the airplane configured for a three-point landing. During the landing roll, the airplane began to veer left. The pilot applied full right rudder and brakes, but the airplane continued the left turn and exited the runway surface. The airplane ground looped, coming to rest facing approximately 90o from the runway centerline. The right wing was substantially damaged. The pilots both reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

411,what type of flight instructor should be selected for take off with a flap plane,"The flight instructor’s failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the demonstrated soft-field takeoff, which led to the airplane exceeding its critical angle-of-attack and experiencing an aerodynamic stall. 
 The student pilot reported that the flight instructor was attempting to demonstrate a soft-field takeoff with 10° of flaps after having completed a short field landing. The flight instructor had the student pilot “follow along on the controls” during the demonstration. After takeoff and while in ground effect, the stall warning horn sounded, and the airplane drifted to the right. Unable to gain airspeed by pitching the nose down due to their low altitude, the flight instructor instructed the student pilot to retract the flaps to 0°. The student pilot reported that immediately following the flap retraction, the airplane stalled to the left and impacted terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to left elevator. The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

429,what is meant by the elevator pushrod pull,"A loss of aircraft control due to the separation of the elevator pushrod attachment bolt.
 While performing an aerial application flight, the pilot heard a loud noise, followed by the nose of the airplane pitching up. The pilot applied full forward pressure on the flight control stick with no response. He then reduced the power to arrest the climb. A company employee who witnessed the accident reported that the airplane pitched up dramatically, hesitated, and then pitched almost straight nose-down before it impacted the ground.
A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the aluminum elevator pushrod was disconnected from the forward idler and that the attachment bolt was missing. The missing attachment bolt was later found undamaged in the wreckage and no additional anomalies were noted with the airplane or engine. It is likely the noise the pilot heard was the attachment bolt separating from elevator pushrod. After the separation, the pilot would have had little to no elevator control, which is consistent with his description of the accident sequence.

The missing attachment bolt was later found undamaged in the wreckage and no additional anomalies were noted with the airplane or engine. It is likely the noise the pilot heard was the attachment bolt separating from elevator pushrod. After the separation, the pilot would have had little to no elevator control, which is consistent with his description of the accident sequence.  
 A loss of aircraft control due to the separation of the elevator pushrod attachment bolt.
. While performing an aerial application flight, the pilot heard a loud noise, followed by the nose of the airplane pitching up. The pilot applied full forward pressure on the flight control stick with no response. He then reduced the power to arrest the climb.

435,what was the pilot on his plane doing when he crashed,"The pilot’s failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle-of-attack and an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s diminished reaction times and flying performance due to a sedating medication.
 The pilot was conducting a personal flight with a passenger when the airplane impacted trees and terrain. There were no witnesses to the accident. During the final 27 seconds of recorded GPS track data, the pilot maintained a north course, descended from 816 to 778 ft mean sea level, and decelerated to 43 mph calibrated airspeed. The aerodynamic stall speed at maximum gross weight was 38 mph. The final recorded position was about 0.5 miles south of the accident site. Although there was no GPS track data for the final portion of the flight, based on the last recorded data point and the accident location, the airplane descended about 761 ft during the final 0.5 mile of the flight. In addition to the steep descent path, the airplane impacted terrain in a nose down pitch attitude consistent with an aerodynamic stall. Postaccident examination revealed no evidence of a mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane before it collided with trees and terrain.

The pilot’s autopsy did not identify any natural disease that would have contributed to the accident; however, toxicology testing detected the presence of the inactive metabolite of clonazepam in heart blood and liver tissue. Considering the half-life of clonazepam, the detected level of the inactive metabolite suggests the pilot’s use of the medication likely occurred several days before the accident; thus, it is unlikely that his use of clonazepam was a factor in the accident.

Toxicology testing also identified the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine at a level above its therapeutic range in the pilot’s blood. Considering that postmortem redistribution of diphenhydramine may result in central levels being two-to-three times higher than peripheral levels, the circulating level was likely in the therapeutic range at the time of the accident. Diphenhydramine causes marked sedation and carries the warning that use may impair mental or physical ability required to perform potentially hazardous tasks. Thus, it is reasonable to consider diminished reaction times and flying performance attributable to the use of sedating medication. It is therefore likely that the impairing effects of diphenhydramine contributed to the accident.

Toxicology testing also identified the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine at a level above its therapeutic range in the pilot’s blood. Considering that postmortem redistribution of diphenhydramine may result in central levels being two-to-three times higher than peripheral levels, the circulating level was likely in the therapeutic range at the time of the accident. Diphenhydramine causes marked sedation and carries the warning that use may impair mental or physical ability required to perform potentially hazardous tasks. Thus, it is reasonable to consider diminished reaction times and flying performance attributable to the use of sedating medication. It is therefore likely that the impairing effects of diphenhydramine contributed to the accident.

455,what causes airplane to stall in trees,"The pilot’s excessive use of pitch control during rotation, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and entering an aerodynamic stall shortly after liftoff.
 The pilot was conducting a personal flight when during takeoff he was too aggressive as he pulled aft on the control stick to rotate, which resulted in a higher-than-normal pitch attitude after liftoff. About 15 seconds after liftoff, he felt the airplane shudder as it began to descend. He decreased airplane pitch to increase airspeed, but the airplane continued to descend. He made an immediate landing in a plant nursery about 0.5 mile from the departure end of runway. The airplane’s nose landing gear collided with a hoop support in the plant nursery before the airplane impacted terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, both wings, and the empennage. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.

A witness reported seeing the airplane taxi to the approach end of the runway and stop momentarily before it continued the takeoff roll with the flaps retracted. He saw the airplane pitch up very sharply about 330-500 ft from the departure end of the runway. The airplane’s pitch attitude was high enough for him to see the top surface of both wings and the horizontal stabilizers. The airplane climbed about 2-3 airplane lengths in the nose-high pitch attitude before it pitched down to a nose-level attitude. The airplane’s tail yawed briefly left and right before the right wing dropped and the airplane descended behind a tree line.

Although the airplane was about 5 lbs over maximum gross weight, it likely still had adequate takeoff performance to achieve a normal takeoff with the runway length available. It is likely the pilot used excessive aft pitch control during rotation, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and entering an aerodynamic stall shortly after liftoff.

 The pilot’s excessive use of pitch control during rotation, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and entering an aerodynamic stall shortly after liftoff.
. The pilot was conducting a personal flight when during takeoff he was too aggressive as he pulled aft on the control stick to rotate, which resulted in a higher-than-normal pitch attitude after liftoff. About 15 seconds after liftoff, he felt the airplane shudder as it began to descend. He decreased airplane pitch to increase airspeed, but the airplane continued to descend. He made an immediate landing in a plant nursery about 0.5 mile from the departure end of runway. The airplane’s nose landing gear collided with a hoop support in the plant nursery before the airplane impacted terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, both wings, and the empennage. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.

A witness reported seeing the airplane taxi to the approach end of the runway and stop momentarily before it continued the takeoff roll with the flaps retracted. He saw the airplane pitch up very sharply about 330-500 ft from the departure end of the runway. The airplane’s pitch attitude was high enough for him to see the top surface of both wings and the horizontal stabilizers. The airplane climbed about 2-3 airplane lengths in the nose-high pitch attitude before it pitched down to a nose-level attitude. The airplane’s tail yawed briefly left and right before the right wing dropped and the airplane descended behind a tree line.

467,what caused a plane to stall after taking off?,"The total loss of engine power shortly after takeoff as a result of the private pilot’s failure to ensure the fuel selector was in the appropriate position and the certified flight instructor’s exceedance of the airplane’s critical angle of attack at the time of the engine power loss, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of airplane control. 
 Witnesses observed the airplane takeoff, and one witness noted its nose-high attitude during takeoff. They then heard the engine lose power. The airplane subsequently pitched down and began a rotation to the right before impacting the ground just north of the runway. 
First responders reported that the fuel selector valve was found in the OFF position when they arrived at the accident site, and they also noted fuel leaking from the airplane. Further examination of the airplane revealed the fuel selector indicator plate displayed a red witness mark adjacent to the fuel selector pointer under one of the OFF-indicator marks, which is an indication the selector was in the OFF position at the time of impact. No evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures were identified that would have precluded normal operation. Because the engine lost power during takeoff, it is possible that there was enough residual fuel in the fuel lines to start the engine and taxi to the runway, even with the selector in the OFF position.
The private pilot was seated in the front seat and the certified flight instructor was seated in the rear seat. The fuel selector was located on the left cabin wall closest to the private pilot; it is likely the private pilot failed to check the position before takeoff. 
When the airplane departed, it was about 21 pounds over the maximum takeoff weight. An increase in the airplane’s weight would have an adverse effect on stability and controllability. Because the airplane was already in a nose-high attitude when the engine lost power, the airplane likely stalled. The increased weight and low altitude when the power loss occurred prevented the pilots from recovering. 
Postmortem toxicology testing detected quinine in the certified flight instructor’s blood and urine at a level that was not quantified; therefore, the amount detected was likely from a tonic drink containing quinine rather than ingestion of the drug and would not have been impairing.

Postmortem toxicology testing detected quinine in the certified flight instructor’s blood and urine at a level that was not quantified; therefore, the amount detected was likely from a tonic drink containing quinine rather than ingestion of the drug and would not have been impairing. 
 The total loss of engine power shortly after takeoff as a result of the private pilot’s failure to ensure the fuel selector was in the appropriate position and the certified flight instructor’s exceedance of the airplane’s critical angle of attack at the time of the engine power loss, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of airplane control. 
. Witnesses observed the airplane takeoff, and one witness noted its nose-high attitude during takeoff. They then heard the engine lose power. The airplane subsequently pitched down and began a rotation to the right before impacting the ground just north of the runway. 
First responders reported that the fuel selector valve was found in the OFF position when they arrived at the accident site, and they also noted fuel leaking from the airplane. Further examination of the airplane revealed the fuel selector indicator plate displayed a red witness mark adjacent to the fuel selector pointer under one of the OFF-indicator marks, which is an indication the selector was in the OFF position at the time of impact. No evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures were identified that would have precluded normal operation. Because the engine lost power during takeoff, it is possible that there was enough residual fuel in the fuel lines to start the engine and taxi to the runway, even with the selector in the OFF position.
The private pilot was seated in the front seat and the certified flight instructor was seated in the rear seat. The fuel selector was located on the left cabin wall closest to the private pilot; it is likely the private pilot failed to check the position before takeoff. 
When the airplane departed, it was about 21 pounds over the maximum takeoff weight. An increase in the airplane’s weight would have an adverse effect on stability and controllability. Because the airplane was already in a nose-high attitude when the engine lost power, the airplane likely stalled. The increased weight and low altitude when the power loss occurred prevented the pilots from recovering.

473,what causes aerodynamic stalls,"The pilot’s failure to maintain airspeed during final approach, which resulted in a loss of control and an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude, and his decision to operate the airplane outside of the approved weight and balance envelope.
 The pilot was conducting an instrument approach at the conclusion of a cross-country flight when the airplane entered a shallow climb and left turn away from the runway heading about 0.5-mile from the intended runway. According to airspeeds calculated from automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast position data, the airplane’s calibrated airspeed was 166 knots when it crossed over the final approach fix inbound toward the runway and was about 84 knots when it was on a 0.5-mile final approach. The airplane continued to decelerate to 74 knots while it was in a shallow climb and left turn away from the runway heading. At no point during the approach did the pilot maintain the airframe manufacturer’s specified approach speed of 85 knots. The airplane impacted the ground in an open grass field located to the left of the extended runway centerline.

The airplane was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain in a wings level attitude. The postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.

The altitude and airspeed trends during the final moments of the flight were consistent with the airplane entering an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude. Based on the configuration of the airplane at the accident site, the pilot likely was retracting the landing gear and flaps for a go-around when the airplane entered the aerodynamic stall. 

The airplane was operating above the maximum landing weight, and past the aft center-of-gravity limit at the time of the accident which can render the airplane unstable and difficult to recover from an aerodynamic stall.  Additionally, without a timely corrective rudder input, the airplane tends to roll left after a rapid application of thrust at airspeeds less than 70 knots, including during aerodynamic stalls. Although an increase in thrust is required for a go-around, the investigation was unable to determine how rapidly the pilot increased thrust, or if a torque-roll occurred during the aerodynamic stall.

According to airspeeds calculated from automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast position data, the airplane’s calibrated airspeed was 166 knots when it crossed over the final approach fix inbound toward the runway and was about 84 knots when it was on a 0.5-mile final approach. The airplane continued to decelerate to 74 knots while it was in a shallow climb and left turn away from the runway heading. At no point during the approach did the pilot maintain the airframe manufacturer’s specified approach speed of 85 knots. The airplane impacted the ground in an open grass field located to the left of the extended runway centerline.

The airplane was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain in a wings level attitude. The postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.

The altitude and airspeed trends during the final moments of the flight were consistent with the airplane entering an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude. Based on the configuration of the airplane at the accident site, the pilot likely was retracting the landing gear and flaps for a go-around when the airplane entered the aerodynamic stall. 

The airplane was operating above the maximum landing weight, and past the aft center-of-gravity limit at the time of the accident which can render the airplane unstable and difficult to recover from an aerodynamic stall.  Additionally, without a timely corrective rudder input, the airplane tends to roll left after a rapid application of thrust at airspeeds less than 70 knots, including during aerodynamic stalls. Although an increase in thrust is required for a go-around, the investigation was unable to determine how rapidly the pilot increased thrust, or if a torque-roll occurred during the aerodynamic stall.

488,what plane landed on a road after taking off,"The airplane’s degraded performance due to high-density altitude and gusting wind conditions, which resulted in its inability to maintain altitude during the initial takeoff climb. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s lack of experience with high altitude flying and his decision to depart in high-density altitude and gusting wind conditions.  
 The pilot and passenger were departing on a personal flight from the high elevation airport. Friends of the pilot reported that this was his first time flying into the airport and that he wanted to depart to the south and head back toward the airport because of the wind and to gain altitude. An eyewitness who was driving saw the airplane flying from the airport as it appeared to be struggling to remain in flight. The airplane turned to fly over the road and toward the eyewitness, who thought it was preparing to land. As the airplane approached, it pitched up and turned to the west to avoid power lines crossing the road. The airplane impacted trees, a building and terrain, sustaining substantial damage. Several other witnesses saw the airplane as is departed the airport and described the airplane as unstable. 

A security camera, located along the road, captured the airplane flying wings level with the landing gear extended, over the road about 50 ft above ground level. As the airplane approached the light poles and power lines, the airplane banked right and traveled behind trees and buildings out of view. It is likely that the pilot was maneuvering the airplane to land on the road.

The calculated density altitude about the time of the accident was 9,360 ft, which would have reduced the airplane's climb performance. Wind was from the west at 9 knots gusting to 21 knots. After the airplane departed the airport to the south toward rising terrain, the airplane turned east over a road, changing the direction of wind to a tailwind, which would have also reduced the airplane’s climb performance by decreasing the airplane’s airspeed. The airplane was also topped with fuel which likely put the airplane near its maximum allowable weight for takeoff. Given these conditions, it is unlikely that the airplane was capable of clearing the rising terrain on the day of the accident.

Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. In addition, airplane damage signatures, witness accounts, and a video indicated that the engine was producing power at the time of the accident. 
Medical evidence showed that the pilot had heart disease, which placed him at increased risk of a sudden impairing or incapacitating cardiac event. However, operational evidence (such as the pilot’s maneuvering to avoid obstacles and attempt to navigate to a suitable landing site) is inconsistent with sudden impairment or incapacitation; therefore, it is unlikely that the pilot’s heart disease contributed to the accident.

After the airplane departed the airport to the south toward rising terrain, the airplane turned east over a road, changing the direction of wind to a tailwind, which would have also reduced the airplane’s climb performance by decreasing the airplane’s airspeed. The airplane was also topped with fuel which likely put the airplane near its maximum allowable weight for takeoff. Given these conditions, it is unlikely that the airplane was capable of clearing the rising terrain on the day of the accident.

Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. In addition, airplane damage signatures, witness accounts, and a video indicated that the engine was producing power at the time of the accident. 
Medical evidence showed that the pilot had heart disease, which placed him at increased risk of a sudden impairing or incapacitating cardiac event. However, operational evidence (such as the pilot’s maneuvering to avoid obstacles and attempt to navigate to a suitable landing site) is inconsistent with sudden impairment or incapacitation; therefore, it is unlikely that the pilot’s heart disease contributed to the accident.
 The airplane’s degraded performance due to high-density altitude and gusting wind conditions, which resulted in its inability to maintain altitude during the initial takeoff climb. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s lack of experience with high altitude flying and his decision to depart in high-density altitude and gusting wind conditions.  
. The pilot and passenger were departing on a personal flight from the high elevation airport. Friends of the pilot reported that this was his first time flying into the airport and that he wanted to depart to the south and head back toward the airport because of the wind and to gain altitude. An eyewitness who was driving saw the airplane flying from the airport as it appeared to be struggling to remain in flight. The airplane turned to fly over the road and toward the eyewitness, who thought it was preparing to land. As the airplane approached, it pitched up and turned to the west to avoid power lines crossing the road. The airplane impacted trees, a building and terrain, sustaining substantial damage. Several other witnesses saw the airplane as is departed the airport and described the airplane as unstable. 

A security camera, located along the road, captured the airplane flying wings level with the landing gear extended, over the road about 50 ft above ground level. As the airplane approached the light poles and power lines, the airplane banked right and traveled behind trees and buildings out of view.

492,rotax 900 ignition valve spring fractures,"The fatigue failure of the No. 2 cylinder intake valve spring retainer due to air trapped in the lubrication system, which resulted in a total loss of engine power. Contributing to the severity of the damage was the improper deployment of the ballistic recovery system.
 During a night flight, the airplane was at 11,000 ft mean sea level when the engine sputtered and lost total power. The propeller would not windmill, and the engine would not restart. Due to the dark night conditions, the pilot could not identify a safe forced landing area, so she deployed the ballistic recovery system (BRS) about 700 ft above ground level.  The left-rear steel suspension cable, one of the two cables and two fabric straps attaching the BRS parachute to the airplane, separated in overload when it caught on a bolt during the BRS deployment. This resulted in an improper deployment of the BRS before the airplane touched down in a left-wing low attitude which substantially damaged the wing.

Examination of the engine revealed the No. 2 intake valve spring retainer was broken, and the intake valve had fallen into the No. 2 combustion chamber, which resulted in the loss of power. The No. 2 valve spring shim exhibited a worn appearance with a groove visible around the shim. According to the engine manufacturer, worn valve spring shims are a clear sign of an engine operating with air in the oil system.

This valve spring retainer failure was not the first one with a Rotax 900 series engine; in 2017, at the end of a cross-country flight, an airplane powered with the same series engine experienced a total loss of engine power, and the pilot performed a forced landing during which the airplane sustained substantial damage. Examination of that engine revealed the presence of a broken valve spring retainer that had resulted in the loss of power. Additionally, it was discovered that the valve spring retainer displayed evidence of metal fatigue.

During 2019 and 2020, in addition to this accident, four more cases of broken valve spring retainers on the Rotax 900 engine series occurred in the United States. All the engines had differing hours of operation. Extensive metallurgical examination of the engine components from these five engines revealed that they met their specifications, and the fractured surfaces on the valve spring retainers revealed the presence of fatigue with pronounced vibration stripes, which was the same pattern that was observed on the valve spring retainer from the 2017 accident.

Review of the engine manufacturer’s published guidance revealed that air could be introduced into the oil lubrication system through several means, including exceedance of the recommended maximum bank angle of 40º, poorly or insufficiently vented hydraulic valve tappets, lack of proper oil system purging, spinning the propeller in the reverse direction from normal rotation, or opening portions of the oil system during maintenance or servicing. Testing of an exemplar engine with air introduced into the lubrication system revealed that with air trapped in the hydraulic tappets, it took about 6.5 minutes of engine operation at 2,538 rpm for air to be purged from the tappets allowing them to work as designed. This indicated that with air trapped in the hydraulic tappets, the valve train could be overloaded, which could lead to a fatigue crack and breakage of a valve spring retainer; this was likely the reason for the fatigue cracking of the valve spring retainers in the 2017 accident, in this accident, and in the other four 2019-2020 engine failures.

During the investigation, the engine manufacturer reviewed its records and found a total of 18 production engine failures due to broken valve spring retainers. The engines were installed on multiple types of aircraft with a large spread in operating hours from as low as 7 hours to as high as 1,936.6 hours. All the components examined met their specifications, and not all the engines were affected by service bulletins that had been issued due to deviations in the manufacturing process of the valve push-rod assembly, which could result in partial wear on the rocker arm ball socket and lead to rocker arm cracking leading to a malfunction of the valve train. These engine failures indicated that valve train failure could occur for reasons other than the push-rod manufacturing issue such as air being introduced into the lubrication system. Additionally, after the engine manufacturer’s record review, an engine in an airplane that was produced in 2021, which should have had all changes included in Rotax guidance materials incorporated before it was placed into service, experienced a valve spring retainer failure, confirming that valve train failure could occur for reasons such as air being introduced into the lubrication system.

The engines were installed on multiple types of aircraft with a large spread in operating hours from as low as 7 hours to as high as 1,936.6 hours. All the components examined met their specifications, and not all the engines were affected by service bulletins that had been issued due to deviations in the manufacturing process of the valve push-rod assembly, which could result in partial wear on the rocker arm ball socket and lead to rocker arm cracking leading to a malfunction of the valve train. These engine failures indicated that valve train failure could occur for reasons other than the push-rod manufacturing issue such as air being introduced into the lubrication system. Additionally, after the engine manufacturer’s record review, an engine in an airplane that was produced in 2021, which should have had all changes included in Rotax guidance materials incorporated before it was placed into service, experienced a valve spring retainer failure, confirming that valve train failure could occur for reasons such as air being introduced into the lubrication system.
 The fatigue failure of the No. 2 cylinder intake valve spring retainer due to air trapped in the lubrication system, which resulted in a total loss of engine power. Contributing to the severity of the damage was the improper deployment of the ballistic recovery system.
. During a night flight, the airplane was at 11,000 ft mean sea level when the engine sputtered and lost total power. The propeller would not windmill, and the engine would not restart. Due to the dark night conditions, the pilot could not identify a safe forced landing area, so she deployed the ballistic recovery system (BRS) about 700 ft above ground level.  The left-rear steel suspension cable, one of the two cables and two fabric straps attaching the BRS parachute to the airplane, separated in overload when it caught on a bolt during the BRS deployment. This resulted in an improper deployment of the BRS before the airplane touched down in a left-wing low attitude which substantially damaged the wing.

Examination of the engine revealed the No. 2 intake valve spring retainer was broken, and the intake valve had fallen into the No. 2 combustion chamber, which resulted in the loss of power. The No. 2 valve spring shim exhibited a worn appearance with a groove visible around the shim. According to the engine manufacturer, worn valve spring shims are a clear sign of an engine operating with air in the oil system.

This valve spring retainer failure was not the first one with a Rotax 900 series engine; in 2017, at the end of a cross-country flight, an airplane powered with the same series engine experienced a total loss of engine power, and the pilot performed a forced landing during which the airplane sustained substantial damage. Examination of that engine revealed the presence of a broken valve spring retainer that had resulted in the loss of power. Additionally, it was discovered that the valve spring retainer displayed evidence of metal fatigue.

During 2019 and 2020, in addition to this accident, four more cases of broken valve spring retainers on the Rotax 900 engine series occurred in the United States. All the engines had differing hours of operation. Extensive metallurgical examination of the engine components from these five engines revealed that they met their specifications, and the fractured surfaces on the valve spring retainers revealed the presence of fatigue with pronounced vibration stripes, which was the same pattern that was observed on the valve spring retainer from the 2017 accident.

Review of the engine manufacturer’s published guidance revealed that air could be introduced into the oil lubrication system through several means, including exceedance of the recommended maximum bank angle of 40º, poorly or insufficiently vented hydraulic valve tappets, lack of proper oil system purging, spinning the propeller in the reverse direction from normal rotation, or opening portions of the oil system during maintenance or servicing. Testing of an exemplar engine with air introduced into the lubrication system revealed that with air trapped in the hydraulic tappets, it took about 6.5 minutes of engine operation at 2,538 rpm for air to be purged from the tappets allowing them to work as designed. This indicated that with air trapped in the hydraulic tappets, the valve train could be overloaded, which could lead to a fatigue crack and breakage of a valve spring retainer; this was likely the reason for the fatigue cracking of the valve spring retainers in the 2017 accident, in this accident, and in the other four 2019-2020 engine failures.

During the investigation, the engine manufacturer reviewed its records and found a total of 18 production engine failures due to broken valve spring retainers. The engines were installed on multiple types of aircraft with a large spread in operating hours from as low as 7 hours to as high as 1,936.6 hours. All the components examined met their specifications, and not all the engines were affected by service bulletins that had been issued due to deviations in the manufacturing process of the valve push-rod assembly, which could result in partial wear on the rocker arm ball socket and lead to rocker arm cracking leading to a malfunction of the valve train. These engine failures indicated that valve train failure could occur for reasons other than the push-rod manufacturing issue such as air being introduced into the lubrication system. Additionally, after the engine manufacturer’s record review, an engine in an airplane that was produced in 2021, which should have had all changes included in Rotax guidance materials incorporated before it was placed into service, experienced a valve spring retainer failure, confirming that valve train failure could occur for reasons such as air being introduced into the lubrication system.
 The fatigue failure of the No. 2 cylinder intake valve spring retainer due to air trapped in the lubrication system, which resulted in a total loss of engine power. Contributing to the severity of the damage was the improper deployment of the ballistic recovery system.
. During a night flight, the airplane was at 11,000 ft mean sea level when the engine sputtered and lost total power. The propeller would not windmill, and the engine would not restart. Due to the dark night conditions, the pilot could not identify a safe forced landing area, so she deployed the ballistic recovery system (BRS) about 700 ft above ground level.  The left-rear steel suspension cable, one of the two cables and two fabric straps attaching the BRS parachute to the airplane, separated in overload when it caught on a bolt during the BRS deployment. This resulted in an improper deployment of the BRS before the airplane touched down in a left-wing low attitude which substantially damaged the wing.

Examination of the engine revealed the No. 2 intake valve spring retainer was broken, and the intake valve had fallen into the No. 2 combustion chamber, which resulted in the loss of power. The No. 2 valve spring shim exhibited a worn appearance with a groove visible around the shim. According to the engine manufacturer, worn valve spring shims are a clear sign of an engine operating with air in the oil system.

This valve spring retainer failure was not the first one with a Rotax 900 series engine; in 2017, at the end of a cross-country flight, an airplane powered with the same series engine experienced a total loss of engine power, and the pilot performed a forced landing during which the airplane sustained substantial damage. Examination of that engine revealed the presence of a broken valve spring retainer that had resulted in the loss of power. Additionally, it was discovered that the valve spring retainer displayed evidence of metal fatigue.

During 2019 and 2020, in addition to this accident, four more cases of broken valve spring retainers on the Rotax 900 engine series occurred in the United States. All the engines had differing hours of operation. Extensive metallurgical examination of the engine components from these five engines revealed that they met their specifications, and the fractured surfaces on the valve spring retainers revealed the presence of fatigue with pronounced vibration stripes, which was the same pattern that was observed on the valve spring retainer from the 2017 accident.

Review of the engine manufacturer’s published guidance revealed that air could be introduced into the oil lubrication system through several means, including exceedance of the recommended maximum bank angle of 40º, poorly or insufficiently vented hydraulic valve tappets, lack of proper oil system purging, spinning the propeller in the reverse direction from normal rotation, or opening portions of the oil system during maintenance or servicing.

502,why does the electric fuel pump fail when taking off,"Improper maintenance practices on the fuel system causing fuel starvation and a total loss of engine power.
 According to the pilot of the experimental, amateur-built airplane, he was taking the airplane out for a test flight after making some adjustments to the propeller blade angles. During the initial climb, the engine lost power, restarted on its own and lost power again. The pilot turned back to the airport, but the airplane could not reach the runway and he conducted a forced landing off-field, which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane. 
Examination of the airplane by a certified mechanic revealed that the fuel pump was weak on pressure and the electric fuel pump was installed incorrectly between the engine driven pump and the carburetor. The fuel flow meter was installed using pipe fittings connected to flare fittings. All fittings were finger tight. These discrepancies were consistent with improper maintenance practices on the fuel system and likely resulted in a reduction in fuel flow during the initial climb after takeoff, and a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.

During the initial climb, the engine lost power, restarted on its own and lost power again. The pilot turned back to the airport, but the airplane could not reach the runway and he conducted a forced landing off-field, which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane. 
Examination of the airplane by a certified mechanic revealed that the fuel pump was weak on pressure and the electric fuel pump was installed incorrectly between the engine driven pump and the carburetor. The fuel flow meter was installed using pipe fittings connected to flare fittings. All fittings were finger tight. These discrepancies were consistent with improper maintenance practices on the fuel system and likely resulted in a reduction in fuel flow during the initial climb after takeoff, and a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.

506,what was the visibility at the time of the plane accident,"The pilot's continued visual flight rules flight into reduced visibility, including likely flat light and/or white out conditions, which resulted in a controlled flight into terrain. Contributing to the accident were the operator’s inadequate operational control procedures, which permitted the pilot to depart into conditions that were below the minimums specified by their operating procedures.
 The commercial pilot departed under a special visual flight rules (VFR) clearance with four passengers on a VFR scheduled passenger flight. The airplane was reported overdue about an hour later when it had not reached its destination and was subsequently located about 35 nautical miles from the departure airport. There was no radar or other flight tracking information available for the accident flight, and the airplane’s flight track before the accident could not be determined; however, the wreckage was located along a direct course between the departure and destination and on a heading consistent with the intended direction of flight. The airplane was highly fragmented and the wreckage was distributed along a nearly 400-ft-long debris path. Examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any evidence of mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. 
The weather about the time of departure included 1 ¼ miles visibility, a runway visual range of 2,200 ft to better than 6,000 ft, unknown precipitation and mist, and an overcast ceiling at 600 ft above ground level (agl). The observation closest to the accident time indicated 3 miles visibility, mist, and an overcast ceiling at 500 ft agl. Between the departure time and the accident time, instrument flight rules or low instrument flight rules conditions prevailed at the departure airport. In the hour after the accident, both the departure and intended destination airports reported low instrument flight conditions with visibility as low as ½ statute mile in light snow, mist, and freezing fog, and cloud ceilings as low as 400 ft agl.
An atmospheric sounding depicted a stable atmosphere with cloud bases around 700 ft agl. A frontal inversion was collocated between the lifted condensation level, around 700 ft agl, and 3,000 ft mean sea level. The wind profile suggested the potential for low-level turbulence based on the low-level wind maximum and the strong vertical shear near the inversion and a 77% probability of moderate to severe turbulence at 700 ft due to the strong vertical wind shear. It is also likely that light to moderate rime icing conditions were present in clouds and precipitation.
The pilot had been recently hired by the operator and had completed initial operating experience requirements the week before the accident. Interviews with the director of operations, general manager, and the flight follower who assigned the accident flight indicated that company policy required a minimum of 2 statute miles visibility and a cloud ceiling of at least 500 ft agl. Pilots were required to complete a flight risk assessment form before each flight, which was to be approved or disapproved by the director of operations or their delegate before the flight was released. No risk assessment form was located for the accident flight, and who approved the flight to depart could not be determined.
Based on the available information, a lack of operational control permitted the pilot to depart into weather conditions that were below the minimums specified by company operating procedures. It is likely that, while en route, the pilot encountered adverse weather including low visibility, precipitation, and turbulence. Such conditions, in addition to the snow-covered terrain and overcast and/or low visibility likely present at the time of the accident, would have been conducive to flat light or white-out conditions. In these conditions pilots can experience illusions that can lead to unrecognized descents because of the difficulty discriminating between terrain and sky to identify a visible horizon. With the low ceilings likely en route, the pilot would have been flying at altitudes that would have precluded recognition and recovery from an inadvertent descent.

Contributing to the accident were the operator’s inadequate operational control procedures, which permitted the pilot to depart into conditions that were below the minimums specified by their operating procedures.
 The commercial pilot departed under a special visual flight rules (VFR) clearance with four passengers on a VFR scheduled passenger flight. The airplane was reported overdue about an hour later when it had not reached its destination and was subsequently located about 35 nautical miles from the departure airport. There was no radar or other flight tracking information available for the accident flight, and the airplane’s flight track before the accident could not be determined; however, the wreckage was located along a direct course between the departure and destination and on a heading consistent with the intended direction of flight. The airplane was highly fragmented and the wreckage was distributed along a nearly 400-ft-long debris path. Examination of the airplane and engine did not reveal any evidence of mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. 
The weather about the time of departure included 1 ¼ miles visibility, a runway visual range of 2,200 ft to better than 6,000 ft, unknown precipitation and mist, and an overcast ceiling at 600 ft above ground level (agl). The observation closest to the accident time indicated 3 miles visibility, mist, and an overcast ceiling at 500 ft agl. Between the departure time and the accident time, instrument flight rules or low instrument flight rules conditions prevailed at the departure airport. In the hour after the accident, both the departure and intended destination airports reported low instrument flight conditions with visibility as low as ½ statute mile in light snow, mist, and freezing fog, and cloud ceilings as low as 400 ft agl.
An atmospheric sounding depicted a stable atmosphere with cloud bases around 700 ft agl. A frontal inversion was collocated between the lifted condensation level, around 700 ft agl, and 3,000 ft mean sea level. The wind profile suggested the potential for low-level turbulence based on the low-level wind maximum and the strong vertical shear near the inversion and a 77% probability of moderate to severe turbulence at 700 ft due to the strong vertical wind shear. It is also likely that light to moderate rime icing conditions were present in clouds and precipitation.
The pilot had been recently hired by the operator and had completed initial operating experience requirements the week before the accident. Interviews with the director of operations, general manager, and the flight follower who assigned the accident flight indicated that company policy required a minimum of 2 statute miles visibility and a cloud ceiling of at least 500 ft agl. Pilots were required to complete a flight risk assessment form before each flight, which was to be approved or disapproved by the director of operations or their delegate before the flight was released. No risk assessment form was located for the accident flight, and who approved the flight to depart could not be determined.
Based on the available information, a lack of operational control permitted the pilot to depart into weather conditions that were below the minimums specified by company operating procedures. It is likely that, while en route, the pilot encountered adverse weather including low visibility, precipitation, and turbulence. Such conditions, in addition to the snow-covered terrain and overcast and/or low visibility likely present at the time of the accident, would have been conducive to flat light or white-out conditions. In these conditions pilots can experience illusions that can lead to unrecognized descents because of the difficulty discriminating between terrain and sky to identify a visible horizon. With the low ceilings likely en route, the pilot would have been flying at altitudes that would have precluded recognition and recovery from an inadvertent descent.
The direction, distribution and fragmentation of the wreckage was consistent with a controlled flight into terrain event.

The observation closest to the accident time indicated 3 miles visibility, mist, and an overcast ceiling at 500 ft agl. Between the departure time and the accident time, instrument flight rules or low instrument flight rules conditions prevailed at the departure airport. In the hour after the accident, both the departure and intended destination airports reported low instrument flight conditions with visibility as low as ½ statute mile in light snow, mist, and freezing fog, and cloud ceilings as low as 400 ft agl.
An atmospheric sounding depicted a stable atmosphere with cloud bases around 700 ft agl. A frontal inversion was collocated between the lifted condensation level, around 700 ft agl, and 3,000 ft mean sea level. The wind profile suggested the potential for low-level turbulence based on the low-level wind maximum and the strong vertical shear near the inversion and a 77% probability of moderate to severe turbulence at 700 ft due to the strong vertical wind shear. It is also likely that light to moderate rime icing conditions were present in clouds and precipitation.
The pilot had been recently hired by the operator and had completed initial operating experience requirements the week before the accident. Interviews with the director of operations, general manager, and the flight follower who assigned the accident flight indicated that company policy required a minimum of 2 statute miles visibility and a cloud ceiling of at least 500 ft agl. Pilots were required to complete a flight risk assessment form before each flight, which was to be approved or disapproved by the director of operations or their delegate before the flight was released. No risk assessment form was located for the accident flight, and who approved the flight to depart could not be determined.
Based on the available information, a lack of operational control permitted the pilot to depart into weather conditions that were below the minimums specified by company operating procedures. It is likely that, while en route, the pilot encountered adverse weather including low visibility, precipitation, and turbulence. Such conditions, in addition to the snow-covered terrain and overcast and/or low visibility likely present at the time of the accident, would have been conducive to flat light or white-out conditions. In these conditions pilots can experience illusions that can lead to unrecognized descents because of the difficulty discriminating between terrain and sky to identify a visible horizon. With the low ceilings likely en route, the pilot would have been flying at altitudes that would have precluded recognition and recovery from an inadvertent descent.
The direction, distribution and fragmentation of the wreckage was consistent with a controlled flight into terrain event.

518,what medication was found in pilot's blood before crash,"The pilot’s loss of control of the motorized glider, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and collision with a residential home and postimpact fire. The reason for the loss of control could not be determined due to the condition of the wreckage.
 The pilot of the motor glider performed a preflight inspection, departed the airport, and remained in the local area conducting maneuvers. Witnesses observed the glider about a mile from the airport and reported hearing unusually loud noises coming from it and, subsequently, a laboring engine. The glider had the appearance of wobbling; the engine surged and sputtered, and the glider then made a sharp left turn and the nose dropped.
The glider's airframe ballistic parachute deployed shortly before the impact with a residential home and a postimpact fire ensued. It is likely that the glider entered an aerodynamic stall and an entry phase of a spin prior to impact.  It is also likely that, despite the pilot’s attempt to pull the airframe parachute, it was not deployed at a sufficient altitude to arrest the descent.
The airframe was destroyed by post-impact fire, which precluded an examination of the flight control system. Examination of the engine did not reveal any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
Toxicology testing detected three potentially impairing substances in the pilot’s specimens. The sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine was detected in his blood and not quantified by one laboratory and not detected in iliac blood by another laboratory. While diphenhydramine is known to cause sedation, the level detected in the pilot’s blood appears to be well below therapeutic levels. Although no absolute threshold for impairment exists, any psychomotor effects from such a low diphenhydramine level would likely have been insignificant. The motion sickness medication meclizine was also detected but not quantified in the pilot’s blood. While meclizine can cause drowsiness, it’s also likely that any effects would have been minor at low concentrations detected. Duloxetine was detected at therapeutic levels in the pilot’s blood. The medication and conditions for which it is prescribed can impair the mental or physical ability to perform complex tasks. However, based on the operational evidence, the pilot appeared to have been intentionally testing the glider and took actions, although too late, to deploy the parachute. Thus, it is unlikely that effects from the pilot’s use of diphenhydramine, duloxetine, and meclizine were factors in the accident.

540,what size wire do i have to spray a helicopter on,"The pilot’s failure to see and avoid a small diameter wire during low altitude agricultural spraying operations. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s insufficient property survey.  
 The pilot was applying insecticide to a farm field and the accident flight was the first time the pilot had sprayed the field.  Once he arrived at the site, 3 hours late, the pilot conducted two circular passes to survey the field, then landed, and the ground crew loaded the insecticide into the hopper. The pilot was not briefed of any hazards to operations prior to the flight by the ground crew or farmer. After takeoff, the pilot started applying the chemicals. 
The helicopter was performing the spraying operation and was flying on a northerly heading when it impacted a non-energized wire. The wire was mounted about 30 feet up a 40 ft pole that also contained a hunting stand and stretched about 250 ft across the field from west to east where it connected to a tree bordering the field. The wire had been installed at least 20 years earlier and was installed high enough that a tractor or combine had clearance to move beneath it during harvest. 
Clear daylight conditions existed at the time of the accident. The sun was at 39.85° above the horizon at an azimuth of 272.39° and was very close to being directly in line with the wire. It is possible that the sun’s position relative to the wire would have made the 5/16-inch wire more difficult to see as the shadow of the wire and pole would have been nearly directly under the wire rather than offset. 
The pilot, unfamiliar with the field, running late, and without the benefit of a detailed discussion with the landowner, relied solely on his brief visual surveillance of the field while operating the helicopter. Although the pilot likely observed the pole and hunting stand during his surveillance, it is likely that he did not see the wire due to its small diameter. Therefore, shortly after initiating the application of the insecticide, the pilot’s failure to see and avoid the wire resulted in the helicopter impacting the wire and the pilot’s subsequent loss of control and impact with terrain.

548,why would a helicopter tail rotor blade cause a fire,"An in-flight separation of a tail rotor blade due to fatigue cracking and overstress, which resulted in a loss of directional control and subsequent ground impact. 
 The pilot was performing an aerial application flight. No radar information was available for the flight. The support truck operator reported that the helicopter departed from the truck and flew toward a field. Shortly after the helicopter departed, the truck operator heard the pilot report over the radio that he was “going down.” A witness reported that the engine noise changed pitch and became loud before impact. A postcrash fire ensued. 

The helicopter struck several large trees and came to rest inverted at the base of a large tree. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operations. However, the tail rotor assembly was found fractured and separated from the tailboom with parts scattered in the initial part of the debris field. One tail rotor blade remained secured at the hub, and the other blade was fractured and separated.

The tension-torsion straps for that blade extended outward from the hub and were fractured and splayed. Metallurgical examination revealed that 10 of the 11 straps fractured from fatigue cracking followed by overstress. The fatigue cracking initiated at multiple locations along the bores in contact with the cylindrical plain bearing. Wear, in the form of smearing, gouging, spalling, and galling of the faying surfaces, led to the fatigue crack initiation. The fatigue cracks then propagated perpendicular to the area with the highest tensile stresses and at the thinnest locations along the bearing bore. No indications of corrosion were observed. Thus, the tail rotor blade separated during flight due to fatigue cracking and overstress.
 
According to the component replacement schedule, the tension-torsion strap bundles are to be replaced every 12,500 flight hours and were set to be removed in 1,383.3 flight hours from the time of the accident.

The helicopter struck several large trees and came to rest inverted at the base of a large tree. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operations. However, the tail rotor assembly was found fractured and separated from the tailboom with parts scattered in the initial part of the debris field. One tail rotor blade remained secured at the hub, and the other blade was fractured and separated.

The tension-torsion straps for that blade extended outward from the hub and were fractured and splayed. Metallurgical examination revealed that 10 of the 11 straps fractured from fatigue cracking followed by overstress. The fatigue cracking initiated at multiple locations along the bores in contact with the cylindrical plain bearing. Wear, in the form of smearing, gouging, spalling, and galling of the faying surfaces, led to the fatigue crack initiation. The fatigue cracks then propagated perpendicular to the area with the highest tensile stresses and at the thinnest locations along the bearing bore. No indications of corrosion were observed. Thus, the tail rotor blade separated during flight due to fatigue cracking and overstress.
 
According to the component replacement schedule, the tension-torsion strap bundles are to be replaced every 12,500 flight hours and were set to be removed in 1,383.3 flight hours from the time of the accident.

552,what is the altitude at which the airplane struck a tree?,"The pilot's failure to maintain the airplane’s speed during takeoff near the airplane’s maximum gross weight in high-density altitude conditions, which resulted in the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and led to an aerodynamic stall, loss of control, and subsequent impact with structures and terrain. 
 The pilot and five passengers departed on an instrument flight rules cross-country flight. A security camera located about midfield at the airport captured the airplane as it lifted off about 3,700 ft from the beginning of the 5,862-ft runway; the liftoff point was likely due to the effects of a 7- to 10knot tailwind. The airplane then began a series of shallow climbs and descents that continued until the airplane was no longer visible on the camera video. About 1 minute 15 seconds after takeoff, the video captured the airplane again as it descended at a steep angle into a residential neighborhood about 1.5miles southeast of the airport. The airplane struck a tree and three structures before it came to rest on its left side in a backyard of a private residence. A postaccident fire ensued, which consumed most of the wings, the cabin area of the fuselage, and a residence. GPS data revealed that the airplane did not exceed an altitude of 120 ft above ground level.    
Recorded engine data revealed consistent operation of the engine throughout the flight until about 15 seconds before the loss of data, when the exhaust gas temperatures and the fuel flow fluctuated likely because the pilot was adjusting the mixture lever. No mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane were found that would have precluded normal operations.
The density altitude about the time of the accident exceeded 7,200 ft mean sea level, and the airplane was close to its maximum gross weight. The effects of high-density altitude conditions and a heavy airplane weight on takeoff performance include increased takeoff roll distance and reduced rate of climb. Review of performance charts indicated that the airplane should have been able to climb at a rate around 500 ft per minute; however, the video evidence indicated that, after takeoff, the airplane had difficulty establishing climb performance. It is likely that, after losing ground effect and while experiencing degraded climb performance due to the high-density altitude, the pilot responded by repeatedly pitching the nose down to gain airspeed and then pitching the nose up to climb. The engine data showed that the pilot apparently manipulated the mixture lever to gain power; however, soon afterward, the airplane’s critical angle of attack was likely exceeded, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall, a loss of control, and an impact with structures and terrain.
A debris path of about 95 ft and minor damage to the spinner and front of the engine cowling suggested that the airplane’s descent was not consistent with a fully developed aerodynamic stall. However, multiple witness accounts were consistent with the onset of an aerodynamic stall, including one witness who reported that the airplane started to bank before it “fell from the sky.”

The engine data showed that the pilot apparently manipulated the mixture lever to gain power; however, soon afterward, the airplane’s critical angle of attack was likely exceeded, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall, a loss of control, and an impact with structures and terrain.
A debris path of about 95 ft and minor damage to the spinner and front of the engine cowling suggested that the airplane’s descent was not consistent with a fully developed aerodynamic stall. However, multiple witness accounts were consistent with the onset of an aerodynamic stall, including one witness who reported that the airplane started to bank before it “fell from the sky.”

 The pilot and five passengers departed on an instrument flight rules cross-country flight. A security camera located about midfield at the airport captured the airplane as it lifted off about 3,700 ft from the beginning of the 5,862-ft runway; the liftoff point was likely due to the effects of a 7- to 10knot tailwind. The airplane then began a series of shallow climbs and descents that continued until the airplane was no longer visible on the camera video. About 1 minute 15 seconds after takeoff, the video captured the airplane again as it descended at a steep angle into a residential neighborhood about 1.5miles southeast of the airport. The airplane struck a tree and three structures before it came to rest on its left side in a backyard of a private residence. A postaccident fire ensued, which consumed most of the wings, the cabin area of the fuselage, and a residence. GPS data revealed that the airplane did not exceed an altitude of 120 ft above ground level.

563,what was the altitude of the airplane when it crashed,"The pilot's failure to maintain the airplane’s speed during takeoff near the airplane’s maximum gross weight in high-density altitude conditions, which resulted in the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and led to an aerodynamic stall, loss of control, and subsequent impact with structures and terrain. 
 The pilot and five passengers departed on an instrument flight rules cross-country flight. A security camera located about midfield at the airport captured the airplane as it lifted off about 3,700 ft from the beginning of the 5,862-ft runway; the liftoff point was likely due to the effects of a 7- to 10knot tailwind. The airplane then began a series of shallow climbs and descents that continued until the airplane was no longer visible on the camera video. About 1 minute 15 seconds after takeoff, the video captured the airplane again as it descended at a steep angle into a residential neighborhood about 1.5miles southeast of the airport. The airplane struck a tree and three structures before it came to rest on its left side in a backyard of a private residence. A postaccident fire ensued, which consumed most of the wings, the cabin area of the fuselage, and a residence. GPS data revealed that the airplane did not exceed an altitude of 120 ft above ground level.    
Recorded engine data revealed consistent operation of the engine throughout the flight until about 15 seconds before the loss of data, when the exhaust gas temperatures and the fuel flow fluctuated likely because the pilot was adjusting the mixture lever. No mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane were found that would have precluded normal operations.
The density altitude about the time of the accident exceeded 7,200 ft mean sea level, and the airplane was close to its maximum gross weight. The effects of high-density altitude conditions and a heavy airplane weight on takeoff performance include increased takeoff roll distance and reduced rate of climb. Review of performance charts indicated that the airplane should have been able to climb at a rate around 500 ft per minute; however, the video evidence indicated that, after takeoff, the airplane had difficulty establishing climb performance. It is likely that, after losing ground effect and while experiencing degraded climb performance due to the high-density altitude, the pilot responded by repeatedly pitching the nose down to gain airspeed and then pitching the nose up to climb.

 The pilot and five passengers departed on an instrument flight rules cross-country flight. A security camera located about midfield at the airport captured the airplane as it lifted off about 3,700 ft from the beginning of the 5,862-ft runway; the liftoff point was likely due to the effects of a 7- to 10knot tailwind. The airplane then began a series of shallow climbs and descents that continued until the airplane was no longer visible on the camera video. About 1 minute 15 seconds after takeoff, the video captured the airplane again as it descended at a steep angle into a residential neighborhood about 1.5miles southeast of the airport. The airplane struck a tree and three structures before it came to rest on its left side in a backyard of a private residence. A postaccident fire ensued, which consumed most of the wings, the cabin area of the fuselage, and a residence. GPS data revealed that the airplane did not exceed an altitude of 120 ft above ground level.    
Recorded engine data revealed consistent operation of the engine throughout the flight until about 15 seconds before the loss of data, when the exhaust gas temperatures and the fuel flow fluctuated likely because the pilot was adjusting the mixture lever. No mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane were found that would have precluded normal operations.
The density altitude about the time of the accident exceeded 7,200 ft mean sea level, and the airplane was close to its maximum gross weight. The effects of high-density altitude conditions and a heavy airplane weight on takeoff performance include increased takeoff roll distance and reduced rate of climb. Review of performance charts indicated that the airplane should have been able to climb at a rate around 500 ft per minute; however, the video evidence indicated that, after takeoff, the airplane had difficulty establishing climb performance. It is likely that, after losing ground effect and while experiencing degraded climb performance due to the high-density altitude, the pilot responded by repeatedly pitching the nose down to gain airspeed and then pitching the nose up to climb. The engine data showed that the pilot apparently manipulated the mixture lever to gain power; however, soon afterward, the airplane’s critical angle of attack was likely exceeded, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall, a loss of control, and an impact with structures and terrain.
A debris path of about 95 ft and minor damage to the spinner and front of the engine cowling suggested that the airplane’s descent was not consistent with a fully developed aerodynamic stall. However, multiple witness accounts were consistent with the onset of an aerodynamic stall, including one witness who reported that the airplane started to bank before it “fell from the sky.”

About 1 minute 15 seconds after takeoff, the video captured the airplane again as it descended at a steep angle into a residential neighborhood about 1.5miles southeast of the airport. The airplane struck a tree and three structures before it came to rest on its left side in a backyard of a private residence. A postaccident fire ensued, which consumed most of the wings, the cabin area of the fuselage, and a residence. GPS data revealed that the airplane did not exceed an altitude of 120 ft above ground level.    
Recorded engine data revealed consistent operation of the engine throughout the flight until about 15 seconds before the loss of data, when the exhaust gas temperatures and the fuel flow fluctuated likely because the pilot was adjusting the mixture lever. No mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane were found that would have precluded normal operations.
The density altitude about the time of the accident exceeded 7,200 ft mean sea level, and the airplane was close to its maximum gross weight. The effects of high-density altitude conditions and a heavy airplane weight on takeoff performance include increased takeoff roll distance and reduced rate of climb. Review of performance charts indicated that the airplane should have been able to climb at a rate around 500 ft per minute; however, the video evidence indicated that, after takeoff, the airplane had difficulty establishing climb performance. It is likely that, after losing ground effect and while experiencing degraded climb performance due to the high-density altitude, the pilot responded by repeatedly pitching the nose down to gain airspeed and then pitching the nose up to climb. The engine data showed that the pilot apparently manipulated the mixture lever to gain power; however, soon afterward, the airplane’s critical angle of attack was likely exceeded, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall, a loss of control, and an impact with structures and terrain.
A debris path of about 95 ft and minor damage to the spinner and front of the engine cowling suggested that the airplane’s descent was not consistent with a fully developed aerodynamic stall. However, multiple witness accounts were consistent with the onset of an aerodynamic stall, including one witness who reported that the airplane started to bank before it “fell from the sky.” 
 The pilot's failure to maintain the airplane’s speed during takeoff near the airplane’s maximum gross weight in high-density altitude conditions, which resulted in the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and led to an aerodynamic stall, loss of control, and subsequent impact with structures and terrain.

576,which aircraft was in field when it crashed,"The noninstrument-rated pilot’s decision to depart in deteriorating weather conditions, which led to restricted visibility and the pilot’s loss of airplane control due to spatial disorientation. Contributing to the pilot’s poor decision-making was self-induced pressure.
 The pilot departed on a visual flight rules cross-country flight in daylight marginal visual flight rules conditions. Flight track and weather radar data indicated that, about 15 minutes after departure, the airplane made a 360° decreasing radius left turn after encountering increasing rain showers and possible cloud layers. After the turn, the ground track became erratic as the airplane descended and its groundspeed varied between 150 and 34 knots, before it struck trees and impacted a field.

All major components of the airplane were located in the vicinity of the main wreckage. Examination of the wreckage revealed no major malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation prior to the accident. 

The pilot requested a preflight weather briefing along the intended route of flight for both the afternoon of the accident and the following day from flight service. The briefer stated that the forecast conditions for the following day included thunderstorms, rain showers, low ceilings, and reduced visibility; and that forecast conditions for the accident day included a convective SIGMET warning of instrument metrological conditions, heavy precipitation, and severe turbulence. The briefer advised that although reported observations indicated visual flight rules conditions at the surface, thunderstorms and rain showers were already present in the area, and visual flight rules flight was not recommended. 

The pilot stated that he would probably depart that afternoon because weather would be worse the following day and shared that his own review of weather showed “everything is VFR as we speak.” The briefer confirmed no instrument conditions at the surface existed but cautioned that cloud layers were “getting pretty close” and areas along the route may drop to instrument conditions due to precipitation. The pilot said he could avoid the precipitation unless he encountered a solid line of thunderstorms. He added, “If I’m going VFR I’m going this afternoon, unless I got clouds that are getting low enough that I can’t fly… and I haven’t heard anything to tell me that.” 

In response the briefer offered a recent weather observation from Mobile Alabama (about 25 miles west of the intended route of flight) showing visibility of 1.5 miles in heavy rain and mist, and advised the pilot that areas along the route of flight experiencing rain showers or thunderstorms may have visibility or ceilings reduced to instrument meteorological conditions, as it did in Mobile. The pilot and briefer then discussed where the precipitation was occurring, and the location covered by the convective SIGMETs before concluding the call. 

In the pilot’s conversation with the briefer, he expressed a sense of urgency to depart for the flight to a destination 267 nm away under less-than-optimal conditions because conditions were forecast to be worse the next day; and evidence indicates that the pilot had a meeting near the destination the day after the accident. As a noninstrument-rated pilot, his decision to conduct a flight into deteriorating weather conditions that included heavy rain showers and likely cloud layers, would have made him vulnerable to the development of spatial disorientation as he encountered areas of restricted visibility. Flight track data in the final moments show altitude and airspeed variations, an erratic flightpath, and a decreasing radius 360° turn, which are characteristic of the known effects of spatial disorientation.

The briefer stated that the forecast conditions for the following day included thunderstorms, rain showers, low ceilings, and reduced visibility; and that forecast conditions for the accident day included a convective SIGMET warning of instrument metrological conditions, heavy precipitation, and severe turbulence. The briefer advised that although reported observations indicated visual flight rules conditions at the surface, thunderstorms and rain showers were already present in the area, and visual flight rules flight was not recommended. 

The pilot stated that he would probably depart that afternoon because weather would be worse the following day and shared that his own review of weather showed “everything is VFR as we speak.” The briefer confirmed no instrument conditions at the surface existed but cautioned that cloud layers were “getting pretty close” and areas along the route may drop to instrument conditions due to precipitation. The pilot said he could avoid the precipitation unless he encountered a solid line of thunderstorms. He added, “If I’m going VFR I’m going this afternoon, unless I got clouds that are getting low enough that I can’t fly… and I haven’t heard anything to tell me that.” 

In response the briefer offered a recent weather observation from Mobile Alabama (about 25 miles west of the intended route of flight) showing visibility of 1.5 miles in heavy rain and mist, and advised the pilot that areas along the route of flight experiencing rain showers or thunderstorms may have visibility or ceilings reduced to instrument meteorological conditions, as it did in Mobile. The pilot and briefer then discussed where the precipitation was occurring, and the location covered by the convective SIGMETs before concluding the call. 

In the pilot’s conversation with the briefer, he expressed a sense of urgency to depart for the flight to a destination 267 nm away under less-than-optimal conditions because conditions were forecast to be worse the next day; and evidence indicates that the pilot had a meeting near the destination the day after the accident. As a noninstrument-rated pilot, his decision to conduct a flight into deteriorating weather conditions that included heavy rain showers and likely cloud layers, would have made him vulnerable to the development of spatial disorientation as he encountered areas of restricted visibility. Flight track data in the final moments show altitude and airspeed variations, an erratic flightpath, and a decreasing radius 360° turn, which are characteristic of the known effects of spatial disorientation.

 The pilot departed on a visual flight rules cross-country flight in daylight marginal visual flight rules conditions. Flight track and weather radar data indicated that, about 15 minutes after departure, the airplane made a 360° decreasing radius left turn after encountering increasing rain showers and possible cloud layers.

 The student pilot was performing a power-off stall and recovery maneuver. The flight instructor was instructing the student through the maneuver as he was performing it. The student performed the maneuver steps correctly until the stall occurred. During the recovery, the student pitched the airplane’s nose down into a near vertical attitude and applied full power instead of pitching the airplane 10o nose down which was the proper recovery attitude, and the airplane entered an inverted spin. The flight instructor reported that she was caught off guard by the student’s actions during the recovery and immediately took control of the airplane. She attempted to recover the airplane from the spin but was unable to regain airplane control. The instructor then deployed the airframe parachute, and the airplane landed in an open field. Surface wind caught the parachute, causing the airplane to be dragged across the field. As a result, the empennage and wings sustained substantial damage.

588,what is the cause of erratic egt?,"A partial loss of engine power on takeoff due to an intermittently blocked fuel injector on the number 3 cylinder.
 The pilot performed a preflight inspection of the airplane with no anomalies noted; during the engine run-up, the engine backfired. The pilot continued the run-up procedures and did not have any other issues with the engine. After rotation, the pilot noticed that the tachometer did not indicate full engine rpm, and also noted that the engine was not producing power. Since the airspeed was slow, he attempted to decrease the pitch of the airplane; however, the airplane was already in an aerodynamic stall, which resulted in impact with the runway. The airplane departed the right side of the runway and impacted the visual approach light system lights, resulting in substantial damage to the right wing. 
A postaccident examination and test run of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A review of data extracted from the airplane’s engine data monitor data revealed that the number 3 cylinder began performing erratically beginning around 7 minutes after the recording began, likely as the airplane was being taxied, and continued through the run-up described by the pilot. This erratic behavior initially appeared as rapid increases and decreases in exhaust gas temperature (EGT) that differed dramatically from the behavior of the other 5 cylinders. Then, about 3 minutes after the erratic EGT temperatures began, the number 3 cylinder head temperature (CHT) began steadily decreasing, while the remaining 5 cylinders continued their gradual increase. The takeoff likely began about 11 minutes and 30 seconds after the data recording began, as the engine rpm increased to about 2,400 (which was less than the maximum 2,700 rpm that was observed during the three previous takeoffs that were recorded). 
Given this information, the most likely explanation for the observed EGT and CHT behaviors was that the number 3 cylinder fuel injector was being intermittently blocked. As the fuel mixture leaned due to the blockage, it produced the spikes observed in EGT, and the blockage eventually progressed to a point where the cylinder was no longer producing power, resulting in the observed gradual CHT cooling. Postaccident examination of the number 3 cylinder fuel injector showed that it was absent of debris and deposits; therefore, the nature and origin of the blockage could not be definitively determined.

Since the airspeed was slow, he attempted to decrease the pitch of the airplane; however, the airplane was already in an aerodynamic stall, which resulted in impact with the runway.

A postaccident examination and test run of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A review of data extracted from the airplane’s engine data monitor data revealed that the number 3 cylinder began performing erratically beginning around 7 minutes after the recording began, likely as the airplane was being taxied, and continued through the run-up described by the pilot. This erratic behavior initially appeared as rapid increases and decreases in exhaust gas temperature (EGT) that differed dramatically from the behavior of the other 5 cylinders. Then, about 3 minutes after the erratic EGT temperatures began, the number 3 cylinder head temperature (CHT) began steadily decreasing, while the remaining 5 cylinders continued their gradual increase. The takeoff likely began about 11 minutes and 30 seconds after the data recording began, as the engine rpm increased to about 2,400 (which was less than the maximum 2,700 rpm that was observed during the three previous takeoffs that were recorded). 
Given this information, the most likely explanation for the observed EGT and CHT behaviors was that the number 3 cylinder fuel injector was being intermittently blocked. As the fuel mixture leaned due to the blockage, it produced the spikes observed in EGT, and the blockage eventually progressed to a point where the cylinder was no longer producing power, resulting in the observed gradual CHT cooling. Postaccident examination of the number 3 cylinder fuel injector showed that it was absent of debris and deposits; therefore, the nature and origin of the blockage could not be definitively determined.

The takeoff likely began about 11 minutes and 30 seconds after the data recording began, as the engine rpm increased to about 2,400 (which was less than the maximum 2,700 rpm that was observed during the three previous takeoffs that were recorded). 
Given this information, the most likely explanation for the observed EGT and CHT behaviors was that the number 3 cylinder fuel injector was being intermittently blocked. As the fuel mixture leaned due to the blockage, it produced the spikes observed in EGT, and the blockage eventually progressed to a point where the cylinder was no longer producing power, resulting in the observed gradual CHT cooling. Postaccident examination of the number 3 cylinder fuel injector showed that it was absent of debris and deposits; therefore, the nature and origin of the blockage could not be definitively determined.

600,why are connecting rods broken,"A total loss of engine power due to the failure of the Nos. 1 and 3 connecting rods from lack of lubrication.
 While maneuvering during the instructional flight the flight instructor noticed that the engine oil pressure was “remarkably low”, and the engine oil temperature was “a bit high.” He took control of the airplane and flew toward nearby roadways in anticipation of a forced landing. The engine then began to run rough, vibrate, and lost partial power. Shortly thereafter, the engine vibrated “incredibly” and lost all power. The flight instructor was unable to restart the engine and performed a forced landing into vegetation. During landing, the airplane flipped over and sustained substantial damage to the wings and forward lower fuselage. 

Examination of the engine revealed that the Nos. 1 and 3 cylinder connecting rods were fractured near their crankshaft end. The remnants and fracture surfaces of the rods, as well as their respective journals on the crankshaft were discolored (blackened and bluish surfaces) and smeared, consistent with thermal stress/damage. The No.4 cylinder connecting rod remained attached to the crankshaft but would not rotate. The crankshaft end of the rod was discolored (black and rust colored), consistent with thermal stress. Bearing material was extruded between the rod and the crankshaft lobe. Holes were found in the crankcase near the base of the No.4 cylinder and on the bottom of each crankcase half. The damage and discoloration of the connecting rod and crankshaft components, as well as the reported loss of oil pressure, suggest a lack of engine lubrication. 

At the accident site, oil was found coating the bottom side of the fuselage, consistent with venting oil overboard during flight. However, it could not be determined if the oil exited through the breaches in the engine crankcase after the connecting rod failures, or, prior to the failures through some other path.  There were no obstructions found in any the visible oil passages in the crankshaft, and the engine oil pump was undamaged, contained no debris, and operated smoothly. It is possible that one or more of the connecting rod bearings spun inside its race, blocking the oil passage(s), which would have resulted in thermal damage to the rods and crankshaft. However, given the evidence available during the engine examination, the reason for the lack of lubrication could not be determined.

The No.4 cylinder connecting rod remained attached to the crankshaft but would not rotate. The crankshaft end of the rod was discolored (black and rust colored), consistent with thermal stress. Bearing material was extruded between the rod and the crankshaft lobe. Holes were found in the crankcase near the base of the No.4 cylinder and on the bottom of each crankcase half. The damage and discoloration of the connecting rod and crankshaft components, as well as the reported loss of oil pressure, suggest a lack of engine lubrication. 

At the accident site, oil was found coating the bottom side of the fuselage, consistent with venting oil overboard during flight. However, it could not be determined if the oil exited through the breaches in the engine crankcase after the connecting rod failures, or, prior to the failures through some other path.  There were no obstructions found in any the visible oil passages in the crankshaft, and the engine oil pump was undamaged, contained no debris, and operated smoothly. It is possible that one or more of the connecting rod bearings spun inside its race, blocking the oil passage(s), which would have resulted in thermal damage to the rods and crankshaft. However, given the evidence available during the engine examination, the reason for the lack of lubrication could not be determined.

605,what causes crankshaft to fail when flying,"A total loss of engine power due to the failure of the Nos. 1 and 3 connecting rods from lack of lubrication.
 While maneuvering during the instructional flight the flight instructor noticed that the engine oil pressure was “remarkably low”, and the engine oil temperature was “a bit high.” He took control of the airplane and flew toward nearby roadways in anticipation of a forced landing. The engine then began to run rough, vibrate, and lost partial power. Shortly thereafter, the engine vibrated “incredibly” and lost all power. The flight instructor was unable to restart the engine and performed a forced landing into vegetation. During landing, the airplane flipped over and sustained substantial damage to the wings and forward lower fuselage.

606,why is the nose landing gear failure,"The failure of the nose landing due to fatigue cracking.
 The pilots were performing an instructional flight and completed a normal approach to the destination runway. The main landing gear touched down on the runway surface first and as soon as the nose lowered, the nose landing gear collapsed. 
 
The nose landing gear fork assembly had collapsed when a pivot-axle welded to the arm in the nose landing gear welding assembly fractured. A metallurgical examination revealed the pivot-axle fracture surface exhibited two opposite facing fatigue cracks propagating inward on the pivot-axle due to reverse bending, consistent with repeated landing forces and cycles prior to the accident. The cracks propagated until the remaining pivot-axle cross section could not withstand the loads on the last landing cycle and succumbed to fracture from overstress.

The location of the crack’s origins required disassembly to detect. Therefore, it would not have been easily detected during routine maintenance. Following this accident, the manufacturer issued a mandatory service bulletin to routinely inspect the nose landing gear for cracks using dye penetrant.

 After landing, as the pilot was taxiing back to the runway for another takeoff, the right landing gear collapsed, and the right wing struck the runway resulting in substantial damage. 
Examination of the landing gear bolts revealed they failed due to reverse bending fatigue cracking. The size of the fatigue cracking area on the fracture surfaces versus the overstress area indicated the fatigue likely grew over time under low-to-moderate stress. The occurrence of the fatigue cracking on all the hex-head bolts and the similarities of the fatigue cracking areas on the fracture surfaces were consistent with some amount of movement on that side of the landing gear, which indicates there was likely an issue with preloading of the bolts.

620,how do you know when your magneto is off,"The pilot’s inadequate pretakeoff checks which resulted in the magneto switch (key) remaining in the OFF position during the takeoff sequence and initial climb and the right magneto grounding intermittently. 
 The pilot reported that it was the second flight of the day. After an uneventful first flight, the helicopter returned to the airport to refuel and pick up new passengers. The purpose of the flight was to hunt game. As the passengers were getting into the helicopter, a rifle was dropped on the dash of the helicopter which turned the alt switch, master switch, and clutch switch to off. The pilot immediately turned the switches back on and conducted a hover power and final systems check. The helicopter then took off uneventfully. About 120 ft above the ground, the engine sputtered once then lost complete power. The pilot performed a left turning autorotation to a field. During the descent, the pilot increased the throttle, but the engine did not respond. The helicopter impacted trees before it landed hard on a small mound of dirt and came to rest nose low. During the impact sequence, the main rotor blade contacted and severed the tail boom. The pilot never reported that he conducted the ‘starting engine and run up’ checklist before taking off. This was confirmed by an onboard video. The video also showed the ignition switch in OFF throughout the flight, the impact, and following the accident sequence.  

During a postaccident engine run, the engine started uneventfully, and a magneto check was completed. When the ignition switch was in the right magneto position the engine rpm stayed the same instead of decreasing, indicating the magneto was not properly grounding. In addition, the engine continued to run despite the ignition switch being in the off position, indicating the engine was operating on one magneto. The ignition switch key was jiggled, manipulated, and even removed from the ignition switch, but the engine continued to run.

In addition, the engine continued to run despite the ignition switch being in the off position, indicating the engine was operating on one magneto. The ignition switch key was jiggled, manipulated, and even removed from the ignition switch, but the engine continued to run. The engine was shut down and electrical continuity was established from the ignition switch to the magnetos. The magneto grounding wires were examined and appeared to be properly secured. The wiring was tested with a volt/ohm meter and functioned normally. The grounding wires were reinstalled, and the engine was restarted. It operated normally and several magneto checks were normal. The magnetos were removed for a functional bench test and disassembly; no anomalies were noted with either magneto. The ignition switch was also removed, disassembled, and examined. No anomalies were found.

Even though functional and disassembly tests did not indicate a problem with the magnetos themselves, the right magneto did not ground appropriately during the initial engine run. The anomaly was unable to be recreated after the magneto grounding wires were removed and reinstalled. 

Because the pilot did not perform all the required pretakeoff checks to ensure all the switches were in the correct positions prior to takeoff, the helicopter took off with the ignition switch in the OFF position. An undefined issue with the grounding wire caused the right magneto to not ground and allowed the helicopter to operate with the ignition in the “off” position. The magneto likely grounded during the initial climb, and since the ignition switch was in the OFF position, the engine shut down.

As the passengers were getting into the helicopter, a rifle was dropped on the dash of the helicopter which turned the alt switch, master switch, and clutch switch to off. The pilot immediately turned the switches back on and conducted a hover power and final systems check. The helicopter then took off uneventfully. About 120 ft above the ground, the engine sputtered once then lost complete power. The pilot performed a left turning autorotation to a field. During the descent, the pilot increased the throttle, but the engine did not respond. The helicopter impacted trees before it landed hard on a small mound of dirt and came to rest nose low. During the impact sequence, the main rotor blade contacted and severed the tail boom. The pilot never reported that he conducted the ‘starting engine and run up’ checklist before taking off. This was confirmed by an onboard video. The video also showed the ignition switch in OFF throughout the flight, the impact, and following the accident sequence.

628,what causes a plane to land in the wrong traffic pattern,"The pilot’s failure to properly configure the airplane’s fuel system, which resulted in a loss of engine power on the left engine due to fuel starvation. 
 The pilot described that at the conclusion of the positioning flight she amended her initial plan to enter the traffic pattern at the destination airport due to potential conflicts with other traffic, and instead completed an entry into a left downwind leg of the traffic pattern. The sequence of events left her “task saturated” and she failed to complete the before-landing checklist and properly configure the twin-engine airplane’s fuel system for landing by switching from the auxiliary to the main fuel tanks. While on final approach to the runway the airplane’s left engine lost power and the airplane began a “lazy Vmc roll to the left.” The pilot attempted to continue ahead toward the runway, but realized that the airplane would not be able to clear power lines, so she maneuvered for a forced landing, and the airplane subsequently impacted the ground.
The pilot reported there were no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Examination of the airplane at the accident site conformed that the left fuel selector was in the “Aux[iliary]” position. Published in the Pilot’s Operating Handbook and placarded between the fuel selectors was: “USE AUX TANKS AND CROSSFEED IN LEVEL FLIGHT ONLY.” Given this information, it is likely that the pilot’s failure to properly configure the airplane’s fuel system while maneuvering for landing resulted in a loss of engine power to the airplane’s left engine due to fuel starvation and the subsequent forced landing.

The flight continued to follow the lake shoreline and the pilot recalled circling once while waiting for the clearance. 

Prior to reaching “the mouth of the river”, the pilot made the decision to divert to another alternate airport, due to the visibility getting worse as they approached the airport. As the pilot began to make an approximate 20° right hand turn over the frozen, snow-covered lake, he noticed the airplane was losing altitude and remembers increasing power and pitch, around this point he “switched to instruments”. The passenger recalled looking to his right and remarked it was like looking at a “white sheet of paper” with the sky blending with the frozen lake. Moments later, the airplane impacted the snow-covered ice while in the turn to the right.

 The pilot stated he was flying about 700 ft above ground level (AGL), then noticed that the airplane had descended “well below 500 ft.” He could see a pump station ahead with powerlines crossing the waterway and stated, “I’m too low.” He was traveling about 170 kts when he pulled back to climb and heard a “thud.” The airplane continued flying, but the pilot had limited rudder control. He returned to the departure airport and landed uneventfully; however, he noticed that the rudder was missing from the airplane. He stated that he looked up the pump station address and drove over to find the rudder laying in the grass near the powerlines. The rudder had impacted the powerline and separated from the airplane, resulting in substantial damage. The pilot reported that the airplane had no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

736,what causes airplane to bounce,"The pilot’s poor pitch control during an aborted takeoff which resulted in a hard landing. 
 The pilot reported that while taxiing for a local night flight, he heard a slight noise that originated from the front of the airplane.  When the stopped the airplane short of the runway, the noise stopped. During the takeoff roll, a louder noise occurred and shortly after the airplane lifted off the ground, the pilot elected to abort the takeoff and pitched nose down. The airplane contacted the runway and bounced multiple times, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage. 

A postaccident examination conducted by maintenance personnel could not determine a reason for the noise. A flight instructor, who flew the airplane earlier in the day, reported that he heard a noise that he thought was coming from the nosewheel shimmy dampener. Except for the noise the pilot heard, he reported no other mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

"
774,how much altitude did helicopter go into when hailed by firefighter,"A flight control malfunction due to either a hydraulic hardover or a flight control stiffness event, which resulted in a loss of control. 
 The helicopter was on its fourth short external load flight to reposition supplies for ground firefighting crews using a 100-ft-long line when the accident occurred. The pilot had flown a similar route for each of his three previous uneventful flights that morning. When the helicopter reached a plateau, about halfway through the flight, witnesses observed it begin to fly erratically, transitioning into a brief high nose-up pitch attitude and then wobbling and banking in a series of irregular movements before stabilizing. A few seconds later, the helicopter wobbled and banked erratically again and then entered another high nose-up attitude before it descended rapidly towards the ground. Witness statements indicated that the helicopter either banked left or right while in a high nose-up attitude just before it descended and impacted the ground.

A meteorology study found that at the time of the accident, the density altitude was about 7,980 ft; the wind was from the west-southwest about 10 knots; and sky conditions were clear. Comparison of the helicopter’s flight track at the time of the accident and the reported wind conditions indicated the helicopter likely encountered a right quartering tailwind during the first upset and a left quartering tailwind during the second (final) upset. Although the helicopter was operating in high density altitude conditions with a low forward groundspeed, the pilot had completed three successful external load lifts from the same departure point to the same destination before the accident with no reported helicopter instability. Further, although dust devils were reported by witnesses on multiple days before the accident, there were no indications from witnesses that any were present at the time of the accident. Therefore, it is unlikely that meteorological conditions contributed to the inflight loss of control.

The left lateral servo was found at near full extension, and the right lateral servo was found slightly more than half extended. These positions closely corresponded to a cyclic position of full aft and either right or left and were consistent with the extreme nose-up position of the helicopter immediately before its vertical descent to the ground. The helicopter would normally be controlled by the pilot via small fine cyclic inputs that would rarely exceed half of the full deflection of the cyclic control stick. An intentional full aft and either right or left deflection of the cyclic control by the pilot would not be consistent with the type of operation being performed with an external load, which requires smooth moderate control inputs and adjustments. The control servo positions were consistent with the preimpact attitude of the helicopter and likely indicate that the flight controls were positioned in a full aft and an undetermined lateral cyclic position and fixed there until impact. 

Since it is unlikely the pilot intentionally manipulated the cyclic to produce the erratic movements displayed by the helicopter, these movements were likely the result of a hydraulic failure, flight control stiffness event, or hydraulic hardover. A light bulb analysis found that the HYD PRESSURE warning light filament was not stretched at the time of impact, which suggests that the hydraulic pressure had not dropped below 400 pounds per square inch and that the hydraulic control switch had not been turned off by the pilot; therefore, a hydraulic failure likely did not occur. A control stiffness or hydraulic hardover was likely as either could have been caused by a failure within the irreversible valve on either lateral servo. Either malfunction would have made it difficult for the pilot to operate the cyclic and maintain control of the helicopter. However, the investigation was unable to determine whether the loss of control was due to a hydraulic hardover or flight control stiffness event due to a lack of available evidence as the servo components were extensively damaged by impact and postcrash fire.

The left lateral servo was found at near full extension, and the right lateral servo was found slightly more than half extended. These positions closely corresponded to a cyclic position of full aft and either right or left and were consistent with the extreme nose-up position of the helicopter immediately before its vertical descent to the ground. The helicopter would normally be controlled by the pilot via small fine cyclic inputs that would rarely exceed half of the full deflection of the cyclic control stick. An intentional full aft and either right or left deflection of the cyclic control by the pilot would not be consistent with the type of operation being performed with an external load, which requires smooth moderate control inputs and adjustments. The control servo positions were consistent with the preimpact attitude of the helicopter and likely indicate that the flight controls were positioned in a full aft and an undetermined lateral cyclic position and fixed there until impact. 

Since it is unlikely the pilot intentionally manipulated the cyclic to produce the erratic movements displayed by the helicopter, these movements were likely the result of a hydraulic failure, flight control stiffness event, or hydraulic hardover. A light bulb analysis found that the HYD PRESSURE warning light filament was not stretched at the time of impact, which suggests that the hydraulic pressure had not dropped below 400 pounds per square inch and that the hydraulic control switch had not been turned off by the pilot; therefore, a hydraulic failure likely did not occur. A control stiffness or hydraulic hardover was likely as either could have been caused by a failure within the irreversible valve on either lateral servo. Either malfunction would have made it difficult for the pilot to operate the cyclic and maintain control of the helicopter. However, the investigation was unable to determine whether the loss of control was due to a hydraulic hardover or flight control stiffness event due to a lack of available evidence as the servo components were extensively damaged by impact and postcrash fire.

776,what was the condition that caused the chopper accident,"A flight control malfunction due to either a hydraulic hardover or a flight control stiffness event, which resulted in a loss of control. 
 The helicopter was on its fourth short external load flight to reposition supplies for ground firefighting crews using a 100-ft-long line when the accident occurred. The pilot had flown a similar route for each of his three previous uneventful flights that morning. When the helicopter reached a plateau, about halfway through the flight, witnesses observed it begin to fly erratically, transitioning into a brief high nose-up pitch attitude and then wobbling and banking in a series of irregular movements before stabilizing. A few seconds later, the helicopter wobbled and banked erratically again and then entered another high nose-up attitude before it descended rapidly towards the ground. Witness statements indicated that the helicopter either banked left or right while in a high nose-up attitude just before it descended and impacted the ground.

A meteorology study found that at the time of the accident, the density altitude was about 7,980 ft; the wind was from the west-southwest about 10 knots; and sky conditions were clear. Comparison of the helicopter’s flight track at the time of the accident and the reported wind conditions indicated the helicopter likely encountered a right quartering tailwind during the first upset and a left quartering tailwind during the second (final) upset. Although the helicopter was operating in high density altitude conditions with a low forward groundspeed, the pilot had completed three successful external load lifts from the same departure point to the same destination before the accident with no reported helicopter instability.

778,what was the cause of water leaks in an airplane fuel system?,"Contamination and corrosion within the fuel system that resulted in a blockage, starvation of fuel to the engine, and the total loss of engine power. 
 The pilot/owner and the instructor were conducting an instructional flight. The pilot reported finding no water contamination of the fuel during his preflight inspection of the airplane. They departed, performed airwork, and flew to an airport where several landings were performed. The flight then proceeded toward another airport, and during cruise flight at 1,100 ft mean sea level, the engine lost power. The pilot attempted to restore power but was unsuccessful. During the subsequent off-airport forced landing in soft terrain, the airplane nosed over during the landing roll. 

After the airplane was recovered, small amounts of water were found in samples taken from each fuel tank, the reservoir tank assembly, and the airframe fuel strainer. The fuel tanks were then drained and found to contain about 29 gallons of fuel; the drained fuel did not contain water or contaminants. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed severe contamination of the servo fuel injector inlet screen by ferrous material, as well as evidence of corrosion and water. Additionally, evidence of foreign debris contamination, water, and/or corrosion were found in the fuel strainer, the internal steel valves of the engine-driven fuel pump, and components of the fuel flow divider. No issues were otherwise noted with the engine powertrain, ignition, induction, or exhaust systems. During postaccident testing, leakage was noted from the right fuel cap. 

The most recent annual inspection was completed about 8 months before the accident. Following the first flight after the annual inspection, the pilot reported discrepancies to maintenance personnel regarding water in the fuel tanks, a rough running engine (which was later attributed to water ingestion), and a slow draining right fuel tank sump drain valve. The discrepancies were addressed by removing fuel tank sealant from the right-wing fuel tank drain valve boss ports and resealing the right inlet plate to the upper wing skin. According to the pilot, resealing the plate corrected the water intrusion issue.
Given this information it is likely that the fuel system had been exposed to water for a period that was long enough for significant amounts of corrosion to develop. Ultimately, this resulted in the accumulation of corrosion and debris throughout the fuel system that most likely resulted in a blockage of the fuel injector inlet screen and/or fuel flow divider, fuel starvation, and the total loss of engine power during the accident flight. While the blockage of the servo fuel injector inlet screen occurred over time, it likely did not exist at the time of the airplane’s last annual inspection. The undetected blockage of the right wing fuel tank sump drain valve boss likely existed at the time of the last annual inspection, and may have contributed to the long-term water exposure and on-going water contamination issues after the annual inspection was completed.

After the airplane was recovered, small amounts of water were found in samples taken from each fuel tank, the reservoir tank assembly, and the airframe fuel strainer. The fuel tanks were then drained and found to contain about 29 gallons of fuel; the drained fuel did not contain water or contaminants. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed severe contamination of the servo fuel injector inlet screen by ferrous material, as well as evidence of corrosion and water. Additionally, evidence of foreign debris contamination, water, and/or corrosion were found in the fuel strainer, the internal steel valves of the engine-driven fuel pump, and components of the fuel flow divider. No issues were otherwise noted with the engine powertrain, ignition, induction, or exhaust systems. During postaccident testing, leakage was noted from the right fuel cap. 

The most recent annual inspection was completed about 8 months before the accident. Following the first flight after the annual inspection, the pilot reported discrepancies to maintenance personnel regarding water in the fuel tanks, a rough running engine (which was later attributed to water ingestion), and a slow draining right fuel tank sump drain valve. The discrepancies were addressed by removing fuel tank sealant from the right-wing fuel tank drain valve boss ports and resealing the right inlet plate to the upper wing skin. According to the pilot, resealing the plate corrected the water intrusion issue.
Given this information it is likely that the fuel system had been exposed to water for a period that was long enough for significant amounts of corrosion to develop. Ultimately, this resulted in the accumulation of corrosion and debris throughout the fuel system that most likely resulted in a blockage of the fuel injector inlet screen and/or fuel flow divider, fuel starvation, and the total loss of engine power during the accident flight. While the blockage of the servo fuel injector inlet screen occurred over time, it likely did not exist at the time of the airplane’s last annual inspection. The undetected blockage of the right wing fuel tank sump drain valve boss likely existed at the time of the last annual inspection, and may have contributed to the long-term water exposure and on-going water contamination issues after the annual inspection was completed.

786,which plane had engine failure and did not make a forced landing,"A total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s improper fuel planning and failure to see and avoid the communications tower support guy wire.  
 The pilot and pilot-rated passenger departed from Strawberry Valley Estates Airport (UT24), Alton, Utah, on a cross-country flight. The airplane flew in a direction that was consistent with a heading toward their planned destination, Cedar City Regional Airport (CDC), Cedar City, Utah. As the airplane neared its destination, witnesses heard the pilot make a distress call indicating that the airplane was out of gas and that he was trying to make a forced landing in a field. Other witnesses observed the airplane descending and then impacting terrain. Shortly thereafter, a nearby communications tower collapsed. 

Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane’s main fuel tanks held 20 gallons each with a total of 39.5 gallons of usable fuel. According to a friend of the pilot, the airplane was fueled at North Las Vegas Airport (VGT), Las Vegas, Nevada, on the day before the accident. The airplane then departed VGT and flew two flights with a total time of about 1 hour 55 minutes. On the day of the accident, the airplane departed UT24, which was about 30 miles (and about 20 minutes of flying time) from the last known point of contact from the previous day. The accident flight’s duration was about 31 minutes. The airplane’s distance traveled since fueling was consistent with consuming the usable fuel in the main fuel tanks. Thus, the airplane’s fuel load at the time of departure from UT24 was insufficient to complete the planned flight to CDC, and a total loss of engine power ensued. 

Additionally, examination of the airplane wreckage at the accident site revealed a support guy wire from the communications tower wrapped around the front of the airplane. Thus, while attempting the forced landing, the pilot failed to see and avoid the communications tower and subsequently struck the guy wire.

The accident flight’s duration was about 31 minutes. The airplane’s distance traveled since fueling was consistent with consuming the usable fuel in the main fuel tanks. Thus, the airplane’s fuel load at the time of departure from UT24 was insufficient to complete the planned flight to CDC, and a total loss of engine power ensued. 

Additionally, examination of the airplane wreckage at the accident site revealed a support guy wire from the communications tower wrapped around the front of the airplane. Thus, while attempting the forced landing, the pilot failed to see and avoid the communications tower and subsequently struck the guy wire.

789,what was the cause of the crash in cedar city,"A total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s improper fuel planning and failure to see and avoid the communications tower support guy wire.  
 The pilot and pilot-rated passenger departed from Strawberry Valley Estates Airport (UT24), Alton, Utah, on a cross-country flight. The airplane flew in a direction that was consistent with a heading toward their planned destination, Cedar City Regional Airport (CDC), Cedar City, Utah. As the airplane neared its destination, witnesses heard the pilot make a distress call indicating that the airplane was out of gas and that he was trying to make a forced landing in a field. Other witnesses observed the airplane descending and then impacting terrain. Shortly thereafter, a nearby communications tower collapsed. 

Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane’s main fuel tanks held 20 gallons each with a total of 39.5 gallons of usable fuel. According to a friend of the pilot, the airplane was fueled at North Las Vegas Airport (VGT), Las Vegas, Nevada, on the day before the accident. The airplane then departed VGT and flew two flights with a total time of about 1 hour 55 minutes.

790,when to check for carburetor icing,"A total loss of engine power due to carburetor ice that was not detected by the pilot.
 The commercial pilot departed on a banner tow flight and after takeoff, as part of his procedures, briefly checked two times for carburetor ice. Prior to beginning a descent, he applied carburetor heat a third time, but before he had time to adjust the throttle, the engine lost total power. Unable to restore power he maneuvered over water and dropped the banner as to avoid injury to any persons or property then maneuvered for a forced landing on a road. After touchdown on the road, the airplane collided with a fence and went down a slight embankment before coming to rest upright.
Postaccident examination and operational test run of the engine, as well as the carburetor heat system, revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
The weather conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to the formation of carburetor icing at glide (idle) and cruise engine power settings.

798,what happened if the pilot tried to climb while the plane sank,"The pilot’s failure to maintain positive control of the airplane in mountainous terrain during dark night conditions as a result of spatial disorientation which led to a loss of control and subsequent impact with terrain. 
 The instrument-rated pilot departed on an instrument flight rules (IFR) cross-country flight in dark night conditions. While enroute, the pilot cancelled his IFR clearance and reported to the air traffic controller that he was proceeding to another airport. Shortly thereafter, the pilot requested an IFR clearance to the original destination airport, then corrected himself and asked for an IFR clearance to the second airport. Shortly thereafter, the pilot declared an emergency and reported pitot system icing. The controller asked if the pilot could climb and maintain terrain clearance. The pilot replied that he thought he was climbing and asked the controller to verify the airplane’s altitude. However, recorded data showed the airplane in a rapidly steepening descending left turn in the vicinity of the accident site. The wreckage was located the following morning; however, due to the remote location of the site, it was not recovered or examined.   
The pilot reported loss of the pitot system due to icing which would have affected the accuracy and response of the airspeed indicator. However, the airplane was flying at altitudes below those forecast to support structural icing. The pilot’s subsequent request to ATC to verify his altitude and statement that he thought he was climbing while data showed the airplane was descending reflects confusion. Several minutes before the pilot’s declaration of emergency the airplane’s track was inconsistent with a direct route or the intended route to the destination airport, showing a series of left and right turns with reversing track changes of about 90 degrees. The distance over which these turns occurred is inconsistent with avoidance of precipitation depicted on a portable display or deviating around clouds to maintain VFR which would have been impossible to do so under dark night conditions over an area of sparse cultural lighting.
The track changes prior to the declaration of emergency, the pilot’s reported confusion about the airplane’s vertical trajectory, and resultant loss of control in a descending turn are consistent with the known effects of spatial disorientation. Because the airplane was not recovered there is insufficient evidence whether this was due to a breakdown in the pilot’s scan under the forecasted turbulent conditions or whether failure of vacuum instruments providing attitude and directional information was involved.

Because the airplane was not recovered there is insufficient evidence whether this was due to a breakdown in the pilot’s scan under the forecasted turbulent conditions or whether failure of vacuum instruments providing attitude and directional information was involved. 
"
801,what problem would if a pilot lost his pitot system,"The pilot’s failure to maintain positive control of the airplane in mountainous terrain during dark night conditions as a result of spatial disorientation which led to a loss of control and subsequent impact with terrain. 
 The instrument-rated pilot departed on an instrument flight rules (IFR) cross-country flight in dark night conditions. While enroute, the pilot cancelled his IFR clearance and reported to the air traffic controller that he was proceeding to another airport. Shortly thereafter, the pilot requested an IFR clearance to the original destination airport, then corrected himself and asked for an IFR clearance to the second airport. Shortly thereafter, the pilot declared an emergency and reported pitot system icing. The controller asked if the pilot could climb and maintain terrain clearance. The pilot replied that he thought he was climbing and asked the controller to verify the airplane’s altitude. However, recorded data showed the airplane in a rapidly steepening descending left turn in the vicinity of the accident site. The wreckage was located the following morning; however, due to the remote location of the site, it was not recovered or examined.   
The pilot reported loss of the pitot system due to icing which would have affected the accuracy and response of the airspeed indicator. However, the airplane was flying at altitudes below those forecast to support structural icing. The pilot’s subsequent request to ATC to verify his altitude and statement that he thought he was climbing while data showed the airplane was descending reflects confusion. Several minutes before the pilot’s declaration of emergency the airplane’s track was inconsistent with a direct route or the intended route to the destination airport, showing a series of left and right turns with reversing track changes of about 90 degrees. The distance over which these turns occurred is inconsistent with avoidance of precipitation depicted on a portable display or deviating around clouds to maintain VFR which would have been impossible to do so under dark night conditions over an area of sparse cultural lighting.

802,what is the cause of engine failure in plane,"The pilot’s decision to takeoff with a known mechanical engine anomaly, and the failure of the No. 2-cylinder exhaust valve, which resulted in a total loss of engine power during the initial climb and subsequent impact with terrain. 
 The pilot reported that during the first cross-country flight after an annual inspection, he experienced a rough running engine. He noted that when the engine roughness began, the airplane’s airspeed decreased by 23 knots, and the No. 2 cylinder head temperature decreased from 1,350° F to 650° F. He decided to continue flight at the slower airspeed. The engine roughness once again returned, and the pilot elected to land as soon as practical and have a mechanic look at the engine. However, there were no mechanics available, so the pilot decided to refuel and takeoff. The first takeoff attempt was unsuccessful because the pilot felt a slight hesitation in the engine power during the takeoff roll, and he aborted the takeoff. During the second takeoff attempt, at 250 ft agl, the engine lost power. The airplane descended to the ground, impacted a sand berm, and nosed over. It sustained substantial damage to the right wing and wing left strut 
A postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the No. 2-cylinder exhaust valve failed. The No. 2 cylinder exhaust valve was missing about 45 percent of the valve head and foreign object compression signatures were sustained to the No. 2 piston and cylinder head. The missing exhaust valve head was not present in the No. 2 cylinder. Additionally, the No. 5 cylinder piston and cylinder head sustained foreign object compression signatures. The No. 5 cylinder intake valve exhibited material deformation around the valve seat. 
The engine total time was 2,180.1 hours when the annual inspection was completed. The engine had acquired 3 hours since the last annual. The engine was overhauled after acquiring 909 hours. At the time of the accident, the engine had amassed 1,274.1 hours since major overhaul. It is likely that the initial engine roughness and partial loss of engine power, followed by the total loss of engine power during takeoff was due to the failure of the exhaust valve.

806,"which of the following is a chemical characteristic of a drug that has the ability to adversely affect judgments, risk taking behavior, and impulsivity?","The student pilot’s decision to conduct a flight during night instrument meteorological conditions and his loss of airplane control due to spatial disorientation. Contributing to the accident was the student pilot’s use of an amphetamine and his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
 The non-instrument-rated student pilot departed for a flight with a passenger during night instrument meteorological conditions. The flight track showed that the airplane flew along an irregular flightpath before the airplane entered a spiraling descent and impacted terrain. The airplane was destroyed during the accident. Examination of the wreckage revealed no anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. 
The night instrument meteorological conditions were conducive to the development of spatial disorientation. The lack of visual references likely caused the pilot to become spatially disoriented, as evidenced by the airplane’s spiraling descent. Thus, the pilot’s spatial disorientation led to his loss of control of the airplane. 
Postaccident interviews with the student pilot’s flight instructors revealed that (1) he had been instructed not to fly solo without first discussing weather conditions and notices to air missions with a flight instructor, (2) he had been told that he was not allowed to fly with passengers, and (3) he had been specifically instructed not to fly on the day of the accident due to the expected poor weather conditions. However, the student pilot disregarded these instructions and conducted the flight.
The student pilot held a third-class medical certificate without limitations. At his medical certification examination about 6 months before the accident, the student pilot reported no medications and no medical concerns. Postaccident interviews revealed that the student pilot had a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and was treated with medication that metabolized to amphetamine. 
Toxicology testing detected amphetamine in the student pilot’s specimens. Both amphetamine and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can negatively impact judgment and increase risktaking behavior and impulsivity. The student pilot’s decision to conduct a flight without the skills and experience to operate the airplane safely in night instrument conditions was inappropriate and demonstrated impulsivity and risk-taking behavior. Thus, the effects of the student pilot’s use of amphetamine and his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were factors in this accident. Cetirizine (a sedating antihistamine) was detected in the student pilot’s urine but not in his blood; thus, his cetirizine use was not a factor in this accident.

Postaccident interviews with the student pilot’s flight instructors revealed that (1) he had been instructed not to fly solo without first discussing weather conditions and notices to air missions with a flight instructor, (2) he had been told that he was not allowed to fly with passengers, and (3) he had been specifically instructed not to fly on the day of the accident due to the expected poor weather conditions. However, the student pilot disregarded these instructions and conducted the flight.
The student pilot held a third-class medical certificate without limitations. At his medical certification examination about 6 months before the accident, the student pilot reported no medications and no medical concerns. Postaccident interviews revealed that the student pilot had a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and was treated with medication that metabolized to amphetamine. 
Toxicology testing detected amphetamine in the student pilot’s specimens. Both amphetamine and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can negatively impact judgment and increase risktaking behavior and impulsivity. The student pilot’s decision to conduct a flight without the skills and experience to operate the airplane safely in night instrument conditions was inappropriate and demonstrated impulsivity and risk-taking behavior. Thus, the effects of the student pilot’s use of amphetamine and his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were factors in this accident. Cetirizine (a sedating antihistamine) was detected in the student pilot’s urine but not in his blood; thus, his cetirizine use was not a factor in this accident.

814,what is the name of the runway that the flight crew landed on,"The flight crew’s failure to verify the correct runway for landing, which resulted in a landing on a snow contaminated runway and resulting damage to the airplane. The illumination of the lights associated with the closed runway contributed to the accident. 
 Both pilots reported that, as they approached the airport, they saw runway lights and set up for a visual approach to that runway. They believed the runway they saw was runway 36, but it was in fact runway 32, which had been closed due to snow. A notice to airman had been published to that effect. In addition, the airport’s automated weather observing system recording was appended with the runway closure information. The pilots continued the approach and landed on runway 32. The airplane struck a snow berm at the edge of the intersection with runway 36, the landing gear broke from the airplane, and the airplane slid to a stop. The lower fuselage, wings and ventral strakes sustained substantial damage.
Runway 32 was closed due to a large amount of snow that was in the process of being cleared. About 4 inches of snow remained. The runway lights were on at the time of the accident to aid the snowplow operators in determining the location of the runway edge; however, there were no plows on runway 32 at the time of the accident. The lights for runway 36 may not have been visible due to the snow berms along the runway edge obstructing their view from the side.
Based on the available information, the flight crew inadvertently selected the wrong runway for landing and did not identify the error because they failed to compare the intended runway heading with the final approach course. Contributing to the accident was the fact that the runway 32 lights were left on.

816,what was the a helicopter accident in oahu,"An impact with ocean waters for reasons that could not be determined based on the available information. 
 The pilot, the sole occupant, was making a personal cross-country flight in the helicopter. According to flight tracking data, the helicopter departed and proceeded on course for about 1 hour 33 minutes. The flight track ended when the helicopter was about 70 nautical miles (nm) from its destination, over open ocean water, at an altitude of 394 ft mean sea level, and at a groundspeed of 132 knots.  When the helicopter failed to arrive at its destination, family and friends contacted the Federal Aviation Administration and an extensive search was launched. During the search and rescue (SAR) operation, an inflated yellow pop-out float believed to be from the accident helicopter was located on the ocean surface. The search continued with additional SAR assets; however, minimal debris believed to be from the helicopter was observed in the water, and the search was suspended. Days after the accident, debris was discovered on the shore of an island about 42 nm north from the accident site and identified to be from the helicopter. Most of the helicopter was not located, and it is presumed to have sunk in the ocean waters. The pilot was not located, and an autopsy and toxicology test could not be performed. 
Weather satellite imagery indicated that as the helicopter approached the vicinity of the accident site, it was likely operating in visual meteorological conditions beneath scattered-to-broken cloud cover. A weather station near the accident site reported wind gusting to 27 knots, which could have led to low-level wind shear conditions.

The flight track ended when the helicopter was about 70 nautical miles (nm) from its destination, over open ocean water, at an altitude of 394 ft mean sea level, and at a groundspeed of 132 knots.  When the helicopter failed to arrive at its destination, family and friends contacted the Federal Aviation Administration and an extensive search was launched. During the search and rescue (SAR) operation, an inflated yellow pop-out float believed to be from the accident helicopter was located on the ocean surface. The search continued with additional SAR assets; however, minimal debris believed to be from the helicopter was observed in the water, and the search was suspended. Days after the accident, debris was discovered on the shore of an island about 42 nm north from the accident site and identified to be from the helicopter. Most of the helicopter was not located, and it is presumed to have sunk in the ocean waters. The pilot was not located, and an autopsy and toxicology test could not be performed. 
Weather satellite imagery indicated that as the helicopter approached the vicinity of the accident site, it was likely operating in visual meteorological conditions beneath scattered-to-broken cloud cover. A weather station near the accident site reported wind gusting to 27 knots, which could have led to low-level wind shear conditions.

821,when an airplane has a towbar attached,"The pilot’s failure to remove the towbar from the nose landing gear before takeoff, which resulted in a sustained adverse yaw condition, and his failure to adequately monitor the fuel system while circling the airport, which resulted in fuel starvation and loss of power to the right engine. 
 The pilot departed on a local flight with the towbar attached to the nose landing gear. When the pilot rotated the airplane for takeoff, he felt the left rudder pedal “slam to the floor,” and he could not depress the right rudder pedal, which resulted in a sustained adverse yaw condition. The airplane climbed and drifted left of the runway, so the pilot continued the climb to pattern altitude. During the climb, he saw the towbar attached to the nosewheel through a mirror on the left engine nacelle. The pilot circled the airport about 30 minutes while assistance arrived. During the last circle, as he was descending, the right engine lost power. The pilot recalled that the right fuel gauge showed “low,” and the left fuel gauge was about 1/2 full. The pilot began to crossfeed fuel to the right engine, but he was unsuccessful in getting the right engine to restart. The pilot was unable to maintain airspeed and altitude and was having difficulty maintaining directional control of the airplane, so he elected to land the airplane in an open field. The airplane sustained damage to the fuselage and right wing during the landing.
 
Although the airplane manual states that the crossfeed is to be used in level flight only, the pilot reported that fuel was being fed to the right fuel tank as evidenced by the fuel gauge indication increasing. The pilot reported the airplane’s altitude was a couple hundred feet above the ground when he turned the crossfeed on and this may have prevented him from having adequate time to restart the engine as he was occupied with trying to land the airplane.

During the climb, he saw the towbar attached to the nosewheel through a mirror on the left engine nacelle. The pilot circled the airport about 30 minutes while assistance arrived. During the last circle, as he was descending, the right engine lost power. The pilot recalled that the right fuel gauge showed “low,” and the left fuel gauge was about 1/2 full. The pilot began to crossfeed fuel to the right engine, but he was unsuccessful in getting the right engine to restart.

841,unanticipated yaws helicopter,"The pilot's inadequate pedal application during a transition to hover, which resulted in a loss of yaw control and a subsequent impact with terrain. 
 The pilot was flying over his wheat fields as the wind was from the south at 10 knots. The pilot transitioned to a hover close to the ground and experienced a sudden unanticipated yaw to the left. The helicopter completed more than one full rotation to the left, then landed hard in the field and sustained substantial damage to the main rotor blades and fuselage. Examination of the helicopter and flight control system did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
The helicopter manufacturer had previously issued a safety notice for unanticipated yaw, which stated in part, “A pilot's failure to apply proper pedal inputs in response to strong or gusty winds during hover or low-speed flight may result in an unanticipated yaw…To avoid unanticipated yaw, pilots should be aware of conditions (a left crosswind, for example) that may require large or rapid pedal inputs.” 
Given that the postaccident examination of the helicopter did not reveal any preimpact anomalies and the 10-knot wind at the time of the accident, it is likely that the pilot did not apply adequate pedal input to avoid the loss of yaw control while transitioning to a hover.

845,when did the airplane wing and tail split?,"The pilot’s improper decision to continue flight in an area of moderate-to-heavy icing conditions, which resulted in exceedance of the airplane’s anti-icing system capabilities, a degradation of aircraft performance, and subsequent aerodynamic stall. 

 The pilot was conducting an instrument flight rules cross-country flight and climbing to a planned altitude of 23,000 ft mean sea level (msl). According to air traffic control data, as the airplane climbed through 18,600 ft msl, its groundspeed was 171 knots, and a gradual reduction in groundspeed began. After reaching an altitude of about 20,200 ft msl, the airplane began a descent on a southeast heading. Just before the descent began, the airplane’s groundspeed had decreased to 145 knots. About 2 minutes after the descent began, the airplane turned right to a northeast heading on which it continued for about 30 seconds. The flightpath then became erratic before the data ended. The pilot made no distress calls and did not respond to repeated calls from the controller.

The main wreckage of the airplane was located in densely forested terrain at an elevation of about 930 ft about 1,000 ft south of the last radar return. The outboard portion of the right wing, right aileron, right horizontal stabilizer, and right elevator were not located with the main wreckage and, despite ground and aerial searches with a small unmanned aircraft system, were not found. Examination of the wreckage indicated that the missing wing and tail sections separated in flight due to overload. Examination of the recovered airframe and engine did not reveal evidence of any pre-existing mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.

Weather forecasts indicated that the accident site was in an area where moderate icing conditions up to 25,000 ft msl, embedded thunderstorms, and 2-inch hail were forecasted. Review of preflight weather information received by the pilot indicated that he was aware of the conditions forecast on the route of flight before initiating the flight. Meteorological data revealed that the airplane likely entered icing conditions that ranged from light to heavy as it climbed through 14,000 ft msl about 23 minutes after takeoff and remained in icing conditions for the remaining 16-minute duration of the flight. Freezing drizzle conditions were likely present along the flightpath. 
Although the airplane was equipped for flight in icing conditions, the pilot’s operating handbook contained a warning about flight into severe icing conditions, which stated that flight in freezing drizzle could result in ice build-up on protected surfaces exceeding the capability of the ice protection system. The airplane’s gradual loss of groundspeed as it climbed was consistent with ice accumulating on the airplane. It is likely that during the 16 minutes the airplane was operating in icing conditions, the capability of the ice protection system was exceeded, which resulted in a degradation of aircraft performance and subsequent aerodynamic stall. During the ensuing uncontrolled descent, the structural capability of the airplane was exceeded, which resulted in an inflight break up. 

A review of the pilot’s records revealed multiple certificate application failures for reasons that included inadequate knowledge of cross-country flight planning, aircraft performance, and stalls. Review of the pilot’s airman knowledge written tests found areas answered incorrectly over multiple exams included meteorology, aircraft performance, aeronautical decisionmaking, and stalls.

The ethanol identified in the pilot’s cavity blood was most likely the result of postmortem production. Therefore, effects from ethanol did not play any role in this accident.

The cargo was documented as it was removed from the airplane and remained secure until after it was weighed. Based upon the weight of the cargo, passengers, airplane, and fuel from the filed flight plan, at the time of departure, the airplane would have been about 361 lbs over maximum gross weight. According to the FAA Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, an overloaded airplane “may exhibit unexpected and unusually poor flight characteristics,” which include reduced maneuverability and an increased stall speed.

 The pilot’s improper decision to continue flight in an area of moderate-to-heavy icing conditions, which resulted in exceedance of the airplane’s anti-icing system capabilities, a degradation of aircraft performance, and subsequent aerodynamic stall. 

. The pilot was conducting an instrument flight rules cross-country flight and climbing to a planned altitude of 23,000 ft mean sea level (msl). According to air traffic control data, as the airplane climbed through 18,600 ft msl, its groundspeed was 171 knots, and a gradual reduction in groundspeed began. After reaching an altitude of about 20,200 ft msl, the airplane began a descent on a southeast heading. Just before the descent began, the airplane’s groundspeed had decreased to 145 knots. About 2 minutes after the descent began, the airplane turned right to a northeast heading on which it continued for about 30 seconds. The flightpath then became erratic before the data ended. The pilot made no distress calls and did not respond to repeated calls from the controller.

The main wreckage of the airplane was located in densely forested terrain at an elevation of about 930 ft about 1,000 ft south of the last radar return. The outboard portion of the right wing, right aileron, right horizontal stabilizer, and right elevator were not located with the main wreckage and, despite ground and aerial searches with a small unmanned aircraft system, were not found. Examination of the wreckage indicated that the missing wing and tail sections separated in flight due to overload. Examination of the recovered airframe and engine did not reveal evidence of any pre-existing mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.

Weather forecasts indicated that the accident site was in an area where moderate icing conditions up to 25,000 ft msl, embedded thunderstorms, and 2-inch hail were forecasted. Review of preflight weather information received by the pilot indicated that he was aware of the conditions forecast on the route of flight before initiating the flight. Meteorological data revealed that the airplane likely entered icing conditions that ranged from light to heavy as it climbed through 14,000 ft msl about 23 minutes after takeoff and remained in icing conditions for the remaining 16-minute duration of the flight. Freezing drizzle conditions were likely present along the flightpath. 
Although the airplane was equipped for flight in icing conditions, the pilot’s operating handbook contained a warning about flight into severe icing conditions, which stated that flight in freezing drizzle could result in ice build-up on protected surfaces exceeding the capability of the ice protection system. The airplane’s gradual loss of groundspeed as it climbed was consistent with ice accumulating on the airplane. It is likely that during the 16 minutes the airplane was operating in icing conditions, the capability of the ice protection system was exceeded, which resulted in a degradation of aircraft performance and subsequent aerodynamic stall. During the ensuing uncontrolled descent, the structural capability of the airplane was exceeded, which resulted in an inflight break up. 

A review of the pilot’s records revealed multiple certificate application failures for reasons that included inadequate knowledge of cross-country flight planning, aircraft performance, and stalls. Review of the pilot’s airman knowledge written tests found areas answered incorrectly over multiple exams included meteorology, aircraft performance, aeronautical decisionmaking, and stalls.

The ethanol identified in the pilot’s cavity blood was most likely the result of postmortem production. Therefore, effects from ethanol did not play any role in this accident.

The cargo was documented as it was removed from the airplane and remained secure until after it was weighed. Based upon the weight of the cargo, passengers, airplane, and fuel from the filed flight plan, at the time of departure, the airplane would have been about 361 lbs over maximum gross weight.

855,what causes fires in a airplane,"Maintenance personnel’s inadequate inspection of the airplane, which failed to detect and correct chafed electrical wiring and a degraded fuel bladder with holes, which resulted in ignition of fuel vapor and a right wing explosion.

 The pilot heard a loud bang while starting the right engine and noticed flames exiting the right wing. An airport surveillance camera captured a wing explosion that lasted about 1 second, which substantially damaged the right wing. 

Examination revealed that the right wing outboard aft fuel bladder was brittle, with several holes due to age-related oxidation, and electrical wiring to the navigation lights was chafed in two locations, with evidence of electrical arcing. Review of maintenance records indicated that the airplane was inspected about 50 hours before the accident; the inspection included checking the fuel tanks for leakage, and electrical wiring for chafing. Based on the condition of the fuel bladder and wiring, it is likely that the most recent inspection was inadequate.
 
About 2 years before the accident, the airplane’s left wing exploded due to ignition of fuel vapor. Following the most recent wing explosion accident, the operator instituted several maintenance protocols to aid in detection of a fuel leak, including top-off of the fuel system in conjunction with the wing inspection procedure checklist or unscheduled fuel system maintenance.

 Maintenance personnel’s inadequate inspection of the airplane, which failed to detect and correct chafed electrical wiring and a degraded fuel bladder with holes, which resulted in ignition of fuel vapor and a right wing explosion.

. The pilot heard a loud bang while starting the right engine and noticed flames exiting the right wing. An airport surveillance camera captured a wing explosion that lasted about 1 second, which substantially damaged the right wing. 

Examination revealed that the right wing outboard aft fuel bladder was brittle, with several holes due to age-related oxidation, and electrical wiring to the navigation lights was chafed in two locations, with evidence of electrical arcing. Review of maintenance records indicated that the airplane was inspected about 50 hours before the accident; the inspection included checking the fuel tanks for leakage, and electrical wiring for chafing. Based on the condition of the fuel bladder and wiring, it is likely that the most recent inspection was inadequate.

858,who crashed into the barbed wire in tn,"The pilot’s lack of experience in the gyroplane and his decision to takeoff with a tailwind. As a result, the gyroplane did not generate enough lift to takeoff before it struck a barbed wire fence. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s failure to wear a seatbelt, which would have reduced his level of injury. 
 A witness reported that the pilot purchased the gyroplane in January 2020 and has been undergoing flight lessons. Two days before the accident was the pilot’s first solo flight. On the day of the accident, the witness observed the gyroplane positioned heading to the north on a 300-yard, private, field. The wind was gusting from the south, which was a tailwind. The pilot added full engine power and the gyroplane started its takeoff roll toward the north. The gyroplane never lifted off the ground and impacted a barbed wire fence at the end of the field. The witness proceeded toward the accident site, and he observed that the pilot was ejected from the gyroplane. The gyroplane came to rest upright with the engine still running. After calling for help, he turned the engine off via cockpit controls.
 
The pilot’s flight instructor reported that the pilot had about 20 total hours of flight training over the course of about a year. He would fly a few hours at a time with large gaps in-between. The pilot traveled a long distance to obtain the instruction and about 3 months prior to the accident, he elected to move the gyroplane closer to his home despite the instructor informing him he was not ready for solo flight. It is unknown if the pilot obtained additional flight instruction as advised. 

On scene examination of the airframe did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operations. A large hole was noted in the forward windscreen; the seatbelts remained secured to the airframe, and they were not clasped. Since the pilot was ejected, it is likely he was not wearing a seatbelt. 

The nearest weather reporting station was about 7 nautical miles northwest of the accident site. At the time of the accident, wind was from 160° at 8 knots, gusting to 17 knots, which would have been a tailwind. The AutoGyro Cavalon Pilot Operating Handbook states under Environmental Limitations “Maximum tailwind component for take-off and landing…5 knots.”

The pilot’s toxicology results showed that he had used methamphetamine. His high methamphetamine blood level was consistent with methamphetamine abuse although the level does not indicate if he was experiencing early drug effects (possibly feeling alert, euphoric, and invulnerable, with a tendency to make high-risk decisions) or later effects (possibly feeling restless, disorganized, uncoordinated, and craving more drug). Toxicology results also showed that the pilot had used THC, although it is impossible to infer specific impairing effects from the measured levels of THC and its metabolites, or to predict how THC and methamphetamine effects may have interacted. 

Given the pilot’s overall lack of experience, along with his decision to take off with a tailwind, it is likely he did not possess the necessary skill or experience to safely conduct solo flight. Therefore, it was impossible to determine whether impairment of his handling of the aircraft from drug effects contributed to the accident.

860,what happened when the helicopter turned around and hit a tree,"The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a tree after encountering brownout conditions and a loss of visual reference during the approach to land.  
 The pilot of the helicopter stated that, while maneuvering around the area looking for a suitable landing site, a dirt turnout alongside a road was selected. A tree was noted on the edge of the turnout. An approach was initiated to the site and expected brownout was encountered. About 5 ft above ground, the pilot heard the crewmember in the back of the helicopter call out “hold.” The pilot arrested the descent and came to a hover. Within seconds the asphalt roadway reference was obscured by the brownout and he lost visual reference. He announced, “lost visual” and started to climb, which was his last recollection before regaining consciousness.
The crewmember in the back of the helicopter reported that the helicopter approached the landing zone angled, to the south toward a tree. About 7 to 10 ft above the ground, he noticed that the helicopter was drifting forward, and he called out twice, “You are drifting forward, hold.” The helicopter continued to drift and subsequently, struck a tree and rolled onto its left side. The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and main rotor system.
The pilot reported there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.

878,what was wrong when the airplane overran runway,"The flight crew’s failure to attain a proper touchdown point during landing, which resulted in an overrun of the runway and collision with terrain.
 The pilot-in-command (PIC) of the business jet described that at the conclusion of the flight the second-in-command (SIC) would conduct the landing. The SIC briefed the approach and the PIC agreed. The tower cleared the airplane for the visual approach to runway 22 (4,552-ft-long), noting winds were 300° at 18 knots, gusting to 26 knots. The PIC told the SIC that if he did not feel comfortable with the approach to landing, he should voice his concern, and initiate a go-around or transfer control of the airplane to the PIC. The PIC also briefed the procedure for taking control of the airplane should any unsafe conditions be observed.
The PIC further described that after turning final, the landing checklist was completed, and the airplane was established on a stabilized approach. The SIC noted that he would fly at a slightly higher speed due to varying winds and gusts. Just before touchdown, the airplane “encountered a gust of wind that resulted in a ground effect float.” The airplane then touched down “at Ref speed” and on what the PIC perceived to be the first third of the runway. Due to the float and wind gust upon touchdown, the PIC called for the controls with the intent to initiate a go-around or to bring the airplane to a stop. The PIC then decided not to commence a go-around due to the limited amount of remaining runway available, low airspeed, and time to initiate takeoff power. The PIC realized that the airplane would not come to a stop on the remaining runway, even with maximum braking applied, and the airplane overran the runway and came to a stop in a brook beyond the departure end. The forward portion of the fuselage was substantially damaged during the runway excursion. The PIC reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Review of airport surveillance camera footage showed that the airplane touched down beyond the midpoint of the runway.

The PIC further described that after turning final, the landing checklist was completed, and the airplane was established on a stabilized approach. The SIC noted that he would fly at a slightly higher speed due to varying winds and gusts. Just before touchdown, the airplane “encountered a gust of wind that resulted in a ground effect float.” The airplane then touched down “at Ref speed” and on what the PIC perceived to be the first third of the runway. Due to the float and wind gust upon touchdown, the PIC called for the controls with the intent to initiate a go-around or to bring the airplane to a stop. The PIC then decided not to commence a go-around due to the limited amount of remaining runway available, low airspeed, and time to initiate takeoff power. The PIC realized that the airplane would not come to a stop on the remaining runway, even with maximum braking applied, and the airplane overran the runway and came to a stop in a brook beyond the departure end.

940,what effect does sinking air have on airplanes,"The pilot's encounter with sinking air conditions that resulted in a loss of lift and a subsequent loss of control. 
 The flight instructor reported that after demonstrating maneuvers he noticed that the glider had quickly descended to pattern altitude, so he proceeded into the traffic pattern. He slowed the glider to minimum sink airspeed and then turned onto the base leg about 200 to 250 ft above ground level. During the base leg turn, the glider continued to turn and descend, and the flight instructor was unable to maintain control. The glider impacted terrain short of the runway and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and both wings. The flight instructor reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the glider that would have precluded normal operation. The flight instructor reported that there was sinking air in the flight area.

970,afp plane ground loop accident,"The pilot’s failure to maintain directional control during a landing attempt, which resulted in a ground loop and collision with terrain. Contributing to the accident was the absence of an airspeed indicator due to an alternator failure. 
 The pilot reported that, he experienced an alternator failure approximately 47 minutes from his destination airport. He switched to a backup battery, but within 2 minutes the entire electrical system shut down, which included a loss of his airspeed and altitude indicators. When he reached the airport, he intentionally flew fast to provide a buffer against stalling the airplane as he was in high density altitude conditions. While over the runway at about 5 ft above ground level, he overflew the runway at the same altitude to bleed off excess airspeed. As the airplane decelerated the pilot was unable to determine when the airplane would touchdown due to the loss of his airspeed indicator. According to the pilot, the right main landing gear touched down first followed by the left main landing gear, at which point the airplane began to ground loop. The left elevator impacted a runway light, which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane. The pilot report no other preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

The pilot made a forced landing to treetops in a heavily forested area.
During the on-site examination, a coat of oil was observed on the cowling and one of the wings. Damage was also observed to the engine. The engine examination revealed that a second-stage power turbine blade exhibited fatigue signatures, and molten debris was identified throughout the engine. The debris was subsequently identified as environmental particles, but the source of the debris was not determined from the available evidence for this investigation. The loss of engine power was likely due to the accumulation of foreign melted environmental debris on the engine’s hot section components, which resulted in the first- and second-stage power turbine blades fracturing from tensile overload.

1042,which of the following was not a factor in the collision with the tree,"The pilot’s failure to maintain clearance from a tree while maneuvering at a low altitude. 
 **This report was modified on September 15, 2022. Please see the public docket for this accident to view the original report.**

A witness reported that the airplane overflew the area, about 500 ft above ground level, before it descended and leveled out. The airplane was in a wings-level attitude when the left wing struck a lone tree that was about 60–70 ft tall. The surrounding trees in the area were about 30–50 ft tall. The airplane continued for about 500 feet before it impacted a forested area and came to rest nose-down against a tree. The witness further reported that the engine was running at the time of the accident.
Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Toxicology testing detected a low concentration of the opiate morphine in the pilot-rated passenger’s urine specimen but not in the blood specimen, which suggests use was not recent and any sedating effects would not be present. Therefore, the effects of the pilot-rated passenger’s use of morphine were not a factor in the accident.
It is likely that the pilot did not see the tree that was taller than the surrounding trees while maneuvering at low altitude.

1046,which aircraft did not have enough fuel to take off,"The total loss of engine power shortly after takeoff as a result of the private pilot’s failure to ensure the fuel selector was in the appropriate position and the certified flight instructor’s exceedance of the airplane’s critical angle of attack at the time of the engine power loss, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of airplane control. 
 Witnesses observed the airplane takeoff, and one witness noted its nose-high attitude during takeoff. They then heard the engine lose power. The airplane subsequently pitched down and began a rotation to the right before impacting the ground just north of the runway. 
First responders reported that the fuel selector valve was found in the OFF position when they arrived at the accident site, and they also noted fuel leaking from the airplane. Further examination of the airplane revealed the fuel selector indicator plate displayed a red witness mark adjacent to the fuel selector pointer under one of the OFF-indicator marks, which is an indication the selector was in the OFF position at the time of impact. No evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures were identified that would have precluded normal operation. Because the engine lost power during takeoff, it is possible that there was enough residual fuel in the fuel lines to start the engine and taxi to the runway, even with the selector in the OFF position.
The private pilot was seated in the front seat and the certified flight instructor was seated in the rear seat. The fuel selector was located on the left cabin wall closest to the private pilot; it is likely the private pilot failed to check the position before takeoff. 
When the airplane departed, it was about 21 pounds over the maximum takeoff weight. An increase in the airplane’s weight would have an adverse effect on stability and controllability. Because the airplane was already in a nose-high attitude when the engine lost power, the airplane likely stalled. The increased weight and low altitude when the power loss occurred prevented the pilots from recovering. 
Postmortem toxicology testing detected quinine in the certified flight instructor’s blood and urine at a level that was not quantified; therefore, the amount detected was likely from a tonic drink containing quinine rather than ingestion of the drug and would not have been impairing.

The private pilot was seated in the front seat and the certified flight instructor was seated in the rear seat. The fuel selector was located on the left cabin wall closest to the private pilot; it is likely the private pilot failed to check the position before takeoff. 
When the airplane departed, it was about 21 pounds over the maximum takeoff weight. An increase in the airplane’s weight would have an adverse effect on stability and controllability. Because the airplane was already in a nose-high attitude when the engine lost power, the airplane likely stalled. The increased weight and low altitude when the power loss occurred prevented the pilots from recovering. 
Postmortem toxicology testing detected quinine in the certified flight instructor’s blood and urine at a level that was not quantified; therefore, the amount detected was likely from a tonic drink containing quinine rather than ingestion of the drug and would not have been impairing.

1050,why did my jet lose power,"The total loss of engine power shortly after takeoff as a result of the private pilot’s failure to ensure the fuel selector was in the appropriate position and the certified flight instructor’s exceedance of the airplane’s critical angle of attack at the time of the engine power loss, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of airplane control. 
 Witnesses observed the airplane takeoff, and one witness noted its nose-high attitude during takeoff. They then heard the engine lose power. The airplane subsequently pitched down and began a rotation to the right before impacting the ground just north of the runway. 
First responders reported that the fuel selector valve was found in the OFF position when they arrived at the accident site, and they also noted fuel leaking from the airplane. Further examination of the airplane revealed the fuel selector indicator plate displayed a red witness mark adjacent to the fuel selector pointer under one of the OFF-indicator marks, which is an indication the selector was in the OFF position at the time of impact.

1052,what substance could have been in pilot's blood,"The pilot’s decision to perform a flight while impaired by the effects of alcohol and cocaine, and his failure to maintain terrain clearance during the flight. 
 The noninstrument-rated pilot departed after midnight in dark night conditions. After takeoff, the airplane maneuvered in the vicinity of the airport for 3 minutes before impacting trees on the bank of a river. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot did not hold a current Federal Aviation Administration medical certificate; his most recent medical certificate was issued 4 years before the accident (at which time he reported no previous flight experience). The pilot’s total and recent flight experience could not be confirmed.
Postmortem toxicological testing revealed ethanol in the pilot’s blood, vitreous, and urine. The testing also revealed cocaine, benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite), cocaethylene (a substance that forms when cocaine is metabolized in the presence of ethanol), and ecgonine methyl ester (cocaine metabolite) in the pilot’s blood and urine.  
The levels of ethanol in the pilot’s postmortem blood, vitreous, and urine fit a pattern consistent with ethanol consumption. At the time of the pilot’s death, he had a blood ethanol level more than five times the regulatory limit for conducting a flight, which would be expected to produce marked impairment. 
Unlike the high measured levels of ethanol, the measured levels of cocaine and its metabolites in the pilot’s blood were low. However, postmortem cocaine levels do not directly predict impairing effects, and the effects of cocaine (a central nervous system stimulant) and ethanol (a central nervous system depressant) are not additive. Accordingly, cocaine’s effects on the pilot at the time of the accident flight and how such effects may have interacted with those of ethanol, are unknown. However, the pilot’s decision to perform the flight on a dark night, after consuming alcohol and cocaine, and his failure to maintain terrain clearance are evidence of impaired judgment and performance consistent with known effects of ethanol and cocaine.

1056,when did helicopter engines start getting hot,"The total loss of engine power due to a surge; the reason for the surge could not be determined based on available information. Contributing to the helicopter damage was the total loss of power while the pilot was transitioning through an altitude and airspeed combination that did not allow for a stabilized autorotation. 
 On the day of the accident, the pilot made a series of personal flights that totaled about 1 hour 15 minutes of flying time. During the last flight, he noticed that the engine was operating about 50° higher than it normally did. Immediately after the pilot lowered the collective to descend for a landing, the engine lost total power. When the helicopter was about 25 ft above ground level and at a speed of 10 to 15 knots, the pilot entered an autorotation to land. The combination of altitude and airspeed did not allow the pilot to establish a stabilized autorotation, and the helicopter landed hard, which resulted in a postaccident fire that consumed most of the helicopter. 
 
Postaccident examination of the engine and transmission revealed no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The airframe was thermally destroyed and could not be thoroughly examined, and the engine did not undergo a full tear down. A witness described hearing “three or four pops” and a loud noise, indicating that the engine had surged before it lost total power.

The pilot purchased the helicopter in 2009. A mechanic maintained the helicopter in accordance with an annual maintenance schedule that was similar to the manufacturer’s periodic maintenance schedule and addressed all the manufacturer’s maintenance requirements, including criteria for engine cleaning. The mechanic performed an engine compressor wash and rinse once a year as part of the annual inspection and not according to the number of hours that the helicopter had been flown. He used a non-approved cleaner and non-de-mineralized drinking water and did not run the engine after rinsing it. According to the manufacturer both the infrequent engine cleaning and the use of non-demineralized water could result in higher exhaust temperatures. The last engine wash occurred in July 1019. 

According to the maintenance logbook, the pilot had accrued about 167.8 flight hours in the helicopter from 2011 to 2019. This amount of time throughout the 9-year timeframe likely resulted in multiple downtime periods that exceeded 72 hours and would have required an engine cleaning. 
The helicopter manufacturer published a service letter about engine condition follow-up checks for aging engines, which included the accident engine. According to the mechanic, the owner had performed at least two of the engine aging follow-up checks in the service letter, but there was no documentation of the results of the checks. The absence of these surveillance data precluded a determination of the engine’s condition before the accident. The manufacturer provided other causes for engine performance degradation including erosion of the air ducts, ingestion of foreign objects, vibrations with rubs leading to an abnormal increase of functional clearances, and unbalance caused by the accumulation of foreign objects. None of these examples were cited in the engine examination report. The cause of the engine surge could not be determined with the available evidence from this investigation.

Postaccident examination of the engine and transmission revealed no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The airframe was thermally destroyed and could not be thoroughly examined, and the engine did not undergo a full tear down. A witness described hearing “three or four pops” and a loud noise, indicating that the engine had surged before it lost total power.

The pilot purchased the helicopter in 2009. A mechanic maintained the helicopter in accordance with an annual maintenance schedule that was similar to the manufacturer’s periodic maintenance schedule and addressed all the manufacturer’s maintenance requirements, including criteria for engine cleaning. The mechanic performed an engine compressor wash and rinse once a year as part of the annual inspection and not according to the number of hours that the helicopter had been flown. He used a non-approved cleaner and non-de-mineralized drinking water and did not run the engine after rinsing it. According to the manufacturer both the infrequent engine cleaning and the use of non-demineralized water could result in higher exhaust temperatures. The last engine wash occurred in July 1019. 

According to the maintenance logbook, the pilot had accrued about 167.8 flight hours in the helicopter from 2011 to 2019. This amount of time throughout the 9-year timeframe likely resulted in multiple downtime periods that exceeded 72 hours and would have required an engine cleaning. 
The helicopter manufacturer published a service letter about engine condition follow-up checks for aging engines, which included the accident engine. According to the mechanic, the owner had performed at least two of the engine aging follow-up checks in the service letter, but there was no documentation of the results of the checks. The absence of these surveillance data precluded a determination of the engine’s condition before the accident. The manufacturer provided other causes for engine performance degradation including erosion of the air ducts, ingestion of foreign objects, vibrations with rubs leading to an abnormal increase of functional clearances, and unbalance caused by the accumulation of foreign objects. None of these examples were cited in the engine examination report. The cause of the engine surge could not be determined with the available evidence from this investigation.

The absence of these surveillance data precluded a determination of the engine’s condition before the accident. The manufacturer provided other causes for engine performance degradation including erosion of the air ducts, ingestion of foreign objects, vibrations with rubs leading to an abnormal increase of functional clearances, and unbalance caused by the accumulation of foreign objects. None of these examples were cited in the engine examination report. The cause of the engine surge could not be determined with the available evidence from this investigation.
 The total loss of engine power due to a surge; the reason for the surge could not be determined based on available information. Contributing to the helicopter damage was the total loss of power while the pilot was transitioning through an altitude and airspeed combination that did not allow for a stabilized autorotation. 
. On the day of the accident, the pilot made a series of personal flights that totaled about 1 hour 15 minutes of flying time. During the last flight, he noticed that the engine was operating about 50° higher than it normally did. Immediately after the pilot lowered the collective to descend for a landing, the engine lost total power. When the helicopter was about 25 ft above ground level and at a speed of 10 to 15 knots, the pilot entered an autorotation to land. The combination of altitude and airspeed did not allow the pilot to establish a stabilized autorotation, and the helicopter landed hard, which resulted in a postaccident fire that consumed most of the helicopter. 
 
Postaccident examination of the engine and transmission revealed no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The airframe was thermally destroyed and could not be thoroughly examined, and the engine did not undergo a full tear down. A witness described hearing “three or four pops” and a loud noise, indicating that the engine had surged before it lost total power.

The pilot purchased the helicopter in 2009. A mechanic maintained the helicopter in accordance with an annual maintenance schedule that was similar to the manufacturer’s periodic maintenance schedule and addressed all the manufacturer’s maintenance requirements, including criteria for engine cleaning. The mechanic performed an engine compressor wash and rinse once a year as part of the annual inspection and not according to the number of hours that the helicopter had been flown. He used a non-approved cleaner and non-de-mineralized drinking water and did not run the engine after rinsing it. According to the manufacturer both the infrequent engine cleaning and the use of non-demineralized water could result in higher exhaust temperatures. The last engine wash occurred in July 1019. 

According to the maintenance logbook, the pilot had accrued about 167.8 flight hours in the helicopter from 2011 to 2019. This amount of time throughout the 9-year timeframe likely resulted in multiple downtime periods that exceeded 72 hours and would have required an engine cleaning.

1064,how did the chopper accident happen,"The pilot’s inadequate fuel planning, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s failure to recognize the illumination of the low-fuel caution light.
 The pilot was performing an external load flight in the helicopter and stated he checked ""fuel status and aircraft systems"" before hovering a load into position out of ground effect. At that time, the fuel gauge indicated between 65 and 70 lbs of fuel remained, and he estimated he had about 10 to 15 minutes of operational time remaining to complete the load. The pilot was focused on hovering the helicopter to maintain a 4-ft load height during load delivery when the engine lost power. He maneuvered the helicopter into the wind and away from the ground crew for the forced landing and made a full collective application before entering trees. The helicopter came to rest upright with substantial damage to the fuselage and tailboom.
Examination at the accident site found no fuel in the helicopter’s fuel system. When power was applied to the helicopter at the accident site, the fuel gauge indicated 40 lbs, and the low-fuel caution light illuminated. 
Following recovery, the helicopter was serviced with fuel, and the fuel system worked as designed with no leaks. The engine was started and run with no anomalies noted. The fuel quantity indicator showed 40 lbs above the actual quantity throughout fueling and defueling testing. It could not be determined if the 40-pound discrepancy was due to an out-of-calibration condition pre-accident or to impact forces. The low-fuel caution light, which operated independently of the fuel quantity indicating system, extinguished and illuminated properly during testing. It is likely the light illuminated during the accident flight but was not seen by the pilot due to his attention being outside the helicopter while hovering and maneuvering the load into position. 
Examination of aircraft and fueling records revealed that the fuel consumption rate of the helicopter over the 4 hours before the accident was about 38 gallons per hour, which was consistent with the helicopter’s mission profiles during that time period of both cruise flight and hover out-of-ground-effect external load operations. The accident is consistent with the pilot inadequately planning for the fuel required to complete the flight, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.

1068,what would cause an aircraft fuel pump to fail,"The seizure of the airplane’s engine-driven fuel pump due to internal contamination, which led to a total loss of engine power. The source of the contamination could not be determined based on available evidence.
 The airplane’s engine lost power during cruise flight, and the pilot executed a forced landing to a wooded area. A postimpact fire ensued, and the airplane was destroyed. 

Postaccident examination revealed that the engine-driven fuel pump drive shaft had fractured. No other anomalies were found. Further examination of the pump revealed internal corrosion and smeared material on the ends of the pump rotor vanes. The internal bypass spring was missing, but wear marks indicated that the spring had been in place sometime during the life of the pump. The investigation could not determine whether the spring had been removed or was destroyed and consumed internally. Heat discoloration observed on the rotor shaft was consistent with frictional heating of the shaft. 
 
Disassembly of the engine-driven fuel pump revealed that the ends of the rotor vanes that interfaced with the pump sidewalls showed evidence of smeared material, transfer marks, and other oxidized particles, which were consistent with ferrous wear debris. Such contamination of the internal pump components likely resulted in increased friction, frictional heating, and the eventual seizure of the pump, which led to the total loss of engine power during the accident flight.

 The airplane’s engine lost power during cruise flight, and the pilot executed a forced landing to a wooded area. A postimpact fire ensued, and the airplane was destroyed. 

Postaccident examination revealed that the engine-driven fuel pump drive shaft had fractured. No other anomalies were found. Further examination of the pump revealed internal corrosion and smeared material on the ends of the pump rotor vanes. The internal bypass spring was missing, but wear marks indicated that the spring had been in place sometime during the life of the pump. The investigation could not determine whether the spring had been removed or was destroyed and consumed internally. Heat discoloration observed on the rotor shaft was consistent with frictional heating of the shaft. 
 
Disassembly of the engine-driven fuel pump revealed that the ends of the rotor vanes that interfaced with the pump sidewalls showed evidence of smeared material, transfer marks, and other oxidized particles, which were consistent with ferrous wear debris. Such contamination of the internal pump components likely resulted in increased friction, frictional heating, and the eventual seizure of the pump, which led to the total loss of engine power during the accident flight. The investigation was unable to determine the source of the contamination based on available evidence.

The engine driven fuel pump was subject to a Mandatory Service Bulletin. The service bulletin introduced pump design enhancements to improve relief valve housing sealing characteristics. These enhancements included actions to ensure that valve cover screws are tightened to correct torque values. The materials examination of the pump showed the gaskets were consistent with unmodified original components indicating the accident fuel pump had not been modified in accordance with the service bulletin. Had the service bulletin been complied with a visual inspection would have revealed gasket protrusion observed between the valve and the pump housing. This would have led to maintenance or replacement of the pump.

Maintenance records were destroyed in the airplane when the accident occurred and hence were not available to substantiate if the service bulletin had been complied with.

1084,"when emergency happens in airplane, which fuel tank do you use","The total loss of power in the right engine due to fuel starvation. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s failure to follow the manufacturer-recommended procedure after the loss of power in the right engine.  
 The pilot stated that after an uneventful takeoff with a full fuel load, he proceeded to his destination. After the climb, he positioned the fuel selectors to the auxiliary tanks for about 45 minutes and then switched them back to the main fuel tank position. About 3 hours and 15 minutes into the flight, the right engine surged twice and subsequently quit producing power. He briefly tried switching to the auxiliary fuel tank, but the engine failed to restart. The pilot did not try the cross-feed selection. The pilot notified air traffic control that he was making an off-airport emergency landing because he was unable to maintain altitude and there were no nearby airports. The airplane touched down on desert terrain and during the landing roll, the right wing collided with a fence. 

There was no fuel in the right main tank, minimal fuel in the right auxiliary tank, and fuel was found in the right fuel selector bowl. There was no evidence of leakage or blockage in the right fuel system. The left fuel tanks contained fuel.

1088,when airplane losing power,"The pilot's failure to ensure that sufficient fuel was onboard for nonlevel flight, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.
 During cruise flight, the airplane’s engine lost total power, which resulted in the pilot making an off-field emergency landing on a highway. During the landing, the airplane struck two automobiles and was substantially damaged. 

After the accident, when the wings were removed for transport, 4 to 6 gallons of fuel were drained from the left-wing tank, and the right-wing tank was empty. Except for some fuel damping on the left-wing fuel tank feed hose and fuel staining, both of which were consistent with removal of the wing, no anomalies were noted during the examination of the fuel system. A test run of the engine was accomplished with no anomalies noted. Examination of the engine and data from the installed engine data monitor did not reveal evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions of the engine that would have precluded normal operation. 

Review of the airplane owner’s manual indicated that fuel was supplied to the engine from two rubberized bladder type fuel cells (fuel tanks). Each fuel cell had a single fuel line located in the aft inboard section of the fuel cell. Fuel flowed via gravity from each of these fuel lines through the fuel selector valve and fuel strainer to the carburetor. The manual stated that 1.5 gallons of fuel per fuel tank were unusable and that, when not in level flight, an additional 3.5 gallons of fuel per fuel tank were unusable. This information (the location of the fuel lines in the aft inboard sections of the fuel tanks and the additional unusable fuel when not in level flight) indicated that the engine was susceptible to fuel starvation if the airplane was in a nose-low attitude with insufficient fuel in the fuel tanks. 

According to the chief pilot of the skydiving company that used the airplane for its skydiving operations, the pilot told him that when the engine lost power, the airplane was in a nose low attitude and that the engine was “surging” (losing and regaining power). The chief pilot stated that “surging is a characteristic of fuel starvation as the fuel is being unported and then recovered as the fuel sloshes around in the tank.” The chief pilot expressed the opinion that if the pilot had “pitched the aircraft up to level flight the engine would have had enough fuel to [reach] the nearest airport about 7 miles away.”

Given that the amount of fuel recovered from the airplane (4 to 6 gallons) was less than the total unusable fuel when not in level flight (10 gallons) and that the engine operated with no discrepancies following the accident, it is likely that the loss of engine power occurred when the pilot flew the airplane in a nose low attitude with little fuel onboard, which resulted in fuel starvation.

The chief pilot stated that “surging is a characteristic of fuel starvation as the fuel is being unported and then recovered as the fuel sloshes around in the tank.” The chief pilot expressed the opinion that if the pilot had “pitched the aircraft up to level flight the engine would have had enough fuel to [reach] the nearest airport about 7 miles away.”

Given that the amount of fuel recovered from the airplane (4 to 6 gallons) was less than the total unusable fuel when not in level flight (10 gallons) and that the engine operated with no discrepancies following the accident, it is likely that the loss of engine power occurred when the pilot flew the airplane in a nose low attitude with little fuel onboard, which resulted in fuel starvation.

1089,what was the fuel starvation on an airplane,"The pilot's failure to ensure that sufficient fuel was onboard for nonlevel flight, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.
 During cruise flight, the airplane’s engine lost total power, which resulted in the pilot making an off-field emergency landing on a highway. During the landing, the airplane struck two automobiles and was substantially damaged. 

After the accident, when the wings were removed for transport, 4 to 6 gallons of fuel were drained from the left-wing tank, and the right-wing tank was empty. Except for some fuel damping on the left-wing fuel tank feed hose and fuel staining, both of which were consistent with removal of the wing, no anomalies were noted during the examination of the fuel system. A test run of the engine was accomplished with no anomalies noted. Examination of the engine and data from the installed engine data monitor did not reveal evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions of the engine that would have precluded normal operation. 

Review of the airplane owner’s manual indicated that fuel was supplied to the engine from two rubberized bladder type fuel cells (fuel tanks). Each fuel cell had a single fuel line located in the aft inboard section of the fuel cell. Fuel flowed via gravity from each of these fuel lines through the fuel selector valve and fuel strainer to the carburetor. The manual stated that 1.5 gallons of fuel per fuel tank were unusable and that, when not in level flight, an additional 3.5 gallons of fuel per fuel tank were unusable.

Given that the amount of fuel recovered from the airplane (4 to 6 gallons) was less than the total unusable fuel when not in level flight (10 gallons) and that the engine operated with no discrepancies following the accident, it is likely that the loss of engine power occurred when the pilot flew the airplane in a nose low attitude with little fuel onboard, which resulted in fuel starvation.


 The pilot's failure to ensure that sufficient fuel was onboard for nonlevel flight, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.
. During cruise flight, the airplane’s engine lost total power, which resulted in the pilot making an off-field emergency landing on a highway. During the landing, the airplane struck two automobiles and was substantially damaged. 

After the accident, when the wings were removed for transport, 4 to 6 gallons of fuel were drained from the left-wing tank, and the right-wing tank was empty. Except for some fuel damping on the left-wing fuel tank feed hose and fuel staining, both of which were consistent with removal of the wing, no anomalies were noted during the examination of the fuel system. A test run of the engine was accomplished with no anomalies noted. Examination of the engine and data from the installed engine data monitor did not reveal evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions of the engine that would have precluded normal operation. 

Review of the airplane owner’s manual indicated that fuel was supplied to the engine from two rubberized bladder type fuel cells (fuel tanks). Each fuel cell had a single fuel line located in the aft inboard section of the fuel cell. Fuel flowed via gravity from each of these fuel lines through the fuel selector valve and fuel strainer to the carburetor. The manual stated that 1.5 gallons of fuel per fuel tank were unusable and that, when not in level flight, an additional 3.5 gallons of fuel per fuel tank were unusable. This information (the location of the fuel lines in the aft inboard sections of the fuel tanks and the additional unusable fuel when not in level flight) indicated that the engine was susceptible to fuel starvation if the airplane was in a nose-low attitude with insufficient fuel in the fuel tanks.

1100,when gyro takes off what is the airspeed,"The pilot’s decision to continue the takeoff when the gyroplane’s actual performance failed to match that predicted in his performance planning. Contributing to the accident was the gyrocopter’s insufficient performance for reasons that could not be determined.
 The pilot conducted an intersection takeoff with the gyroplane loaded near its maximum gross weight. The pilot stated he lifted off at 45 knots and accelerated ""in ground effect"" in an attempt to reach his planned climb speed of 55 knots, but the gyroplane would not accelerate past 48 knots. Data from an onboard GPS navigation device revealed that, in calm winds, the gyroplane reached a maximum groundspeed of 40 knots. 
Although the gyrocopter was only about 10 ft above the ground (agl) where, based on the pilot’s performance planning, it should have been 50 ft agl, and sufficient runway and turf overrun were available to abort the takeoff, the pilot chose to continue the takeoff. As the gyroplane approached the airport boundary, it was neither climbing nor accelerating. Due to obstacles beyond the airport’s boundary, the pilot performed a forced landing between the airport boundary fence and the road. The gyroplane landed hard and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
Despite the pilot having completed detailed weight and balance and performance-planning calculations, the pilot continued the takeoff when the gyroplane failed to achieve its predicted performance by large margins. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical deficiencies with the gyroplane that would have precluded normal operation. Examination of the wreckage and a postaccident engine run revealed no anomalies with the gyrocopter. The reason the gyrocopter did not perform as expected could not be determined based on available evidence.

Data from an onboard GPS navigation device revealed that, in calm winds, the gyroplane reached a maximum groundspeed of 40 knots. 
Although the gyrocopter was only about 10 ft above the ground (agl) where, based on the pilot’s performance planning, it should have been 50 ft agl, and sufficient runway and turf overrun were available to abort the takeoff, the pilot chose to continue the takeoff. As the gyroplane approached the airport boundary, it was neither climbing nor accelerating. Due to obstacles beyond the airport’s boundary, the pilot performed a forced landing between the airport boundary fence and the road. The gyroplane landed hard and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
Despite the pilot having completed detailed weight and balance and performance-planning calculations, the pilot continued the takeoff when the gyroplane failed to achieve its predicted performance by large margins. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical deficiencies with the gyroplane that would have precluded normal operation. Examination of the wreckage and a postaccident engine run revealed no anomalies with the gyrocopter. The reason the gyrocopter did not perform as expected could not be determined based on available evidence. 
 The pilot’s decision to continue the takeoff when the gyroplane’s actual performance failed to match that predicted in his performance planning. Contributing to the accident was the gyrocopter’s insufficient performance for reasons that could not be determined.

1114,what problem can result in a right propeller feathering,"The reported partial loss of right engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on available evidence. 
 During an instructional flight, the pilot receiving instruction performed several landings at several airports before proceeding to the home base airport where he executed two touch-and go landings and remained in the airport traffic pattern. When abeam the approach end of the landing runway while on the downwind leg of the airport traffic pattern with the landing gear extended and 10° of flaps extended, the receiving instruction began to descend while turning onto the base leg of the airport traffic pattern. The flight instructor stated that at time he heard an engine sputter and verified the engine controls were in the proper position. He heard the engine sputter again and ""felt the [airplane] jerk"" and stated, ""my controls."" He maintained airspeed and verified the engine controls were full forward, retracted the flaps but decided to leave the landing gear extended due to the altitude and proximity to the airport. He verified the malfunction to be the right engine and felt it was developing some power, but with less output than the left. He briefly pitched nose down, then nose up, and when he noticed a high descent rate, he feathered the right propeller and placed the right mixture control to idle cutoff. He maneuvered for a forced landing on a street but collided with and remained suspended in the roof of a house. 

Postaccident examination of both engines, their systems, left propeller, and left propeller governor revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. There was no evidence or preimpact failure or malfunction of either fuel supply system.
While the flight instructor reported he moved the right propeller control to the feather position near the end of the flight, the right propeller blades were on the start locks and not feathered. Functional testing of the right propeller and operational testing of the right propeller governor revealed no preimpact failure or malfunction. Therefore, there was no mechanical reason why the right propeller blades would not feather if commanded before the engine rpm became too low and engaged the propeller start locks.

When abeam the approach end of the landing runway while on the downwind leg of the airport traffic pattern with the landing gear extended and 10° of flaps extended, the receiving instruction began to descend while turning onto the base leg of the airport traffic pattern. The flight instructor stated that at time he heard an engine sputter and verified the engine controls were in the proper position. He heard the engine sputter again and ""felt the [airplane] jerk"" and stated, ""my controls."" He maintained airspeed and verified the engine controls were full forward, retracted the flaps but decided to leave the landing gear extended due to the altitude and proximity to the airport. He verified the malfunction to be the right engine and felt it was developing some power, but with less output than the left. He briefly pitched nose down, then nose up, and when he noticed a high descent rate, he feathered the right propeller and placed the right mixture control to idle cutoff. He maneuvered for a forced landing on a street but collided with and remained suspended in the roof of a house. 

Postaccident examination of both engines, their systems, left propeller, and left propeller governor revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. There was no evidence or preimpact failure or malfunction of either fuel supply system.
While the flight instructor reported he moved the right propeller control to the feather position near the end of the flight, the right propeller blades were on the start locks and not feathered. Functional testing of the right propeller and operational testing of the right propeller governor revealed no preimpact failure or malfunction. Therefore, there was no mechanical reason why the right propeller blades would not feather if commanded before the engine rpm became too low and engaged the propeller start locks.

1120,what causes an airplane to lose power,"A total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the fuel exhaustion was the fatigue fracture of an electrical wire in the tank unit or fuel transmitter, which likely resulted in an inaccurate fuel quantity indication.
 The pilot-in-command seated in the right seat was providing familiarization in the multi-engine airplane to the left seat pilot during a flight to a nearby airport for fuel. Shortly after takeoff, one of the pilots reported an engine problem and advised that they were diverting to a nearby airport. A witness along the route of flight reported hearing the engines accelerating and decelerating and then popping sounds; several witnesses near the accident site reported hearing no engine sounds. The airplane impacted a building and terrain about 10 minutes after takeoff. Very minimal fuel leakage on the ground was noted and only 23 ounces of aviation fuel were collected from the airplane’s five fuel tanks. No evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction was noted for either engine or propeller; the damage to both propellers was consistent with low-to-no power at impact.

Since the pilot could not have visually verified the fuel level in the center fuel tank because of the low quantity of fuel prior to the flight, he would have had to rely on fuel consumption calculations since fueling based on flight time and the airplane’s fuel quantity indicating system. Although the fuel quantity indications at engine start and impact could not be determined postaccident from the available evidence, if the fuel quantity reading at the start of the flight was accurate based on the amount of fuel required for engine start, taxi, run-up, takeoff, and then only to fly the accident flight duration of 10 minutes, it would have been reading between 8 and 10 gallons. It is unlikely that the pilot, who was a chief pilot of a cargo operation and tasked with familiarizing company pilots in the airplane, would have knowingly initiated the flight with an insufficient fuel load for the intended flight or with the fuel gauge accurately registering the actual fuel load that was on-board.

Examination of the tank unit, or fuel quantity transmitter, revealed that the resistance between pins A and B, which were the ends of the resistor element inside the housing, fell within specification. When monitoring the potentiometer pin C, there was no resistance, indicating an open circuit between the wiper and the resistor element. X-ray imaging revealed that the conductor of electrical wire was fractured between the end of the lugs at the wiper and for pin C. Bypassing the fractured conductor, the resistive readings followed the position of the float arm consistent with normal operation. Visual examination of the wire insulation revealed no evidence of shorting, burning or damage. Examination of the fractured electrical conductor by the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed that many of the individual wires exhibited intergranular fracture surface features with fatigue striations in various directions on some individual grains. 

It is likely that the many fatigue fractured conductor strands of the electrical wire inside the accident tank unit or fuel transmitter resulted in the fuel gauge indicating that the tanks contained more fuel than the amount that was actually on board, which resulted in inadequate fuel for the intended flight and a subsequent total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. The inaccurate fuel indication would also be consistent with the pilot’s decision to decline additional fuel before departing on the accident flight.

While the estimated fuel remaining since fueling (between 15 and 51 gallons) was substantially more than the actual amount on board at the start of the accident flight (between 8 and 10 gallons), the difference could have been caused by either not allowing the fuel to settle during fueling, and/or the operational use of the airplane. Ultimately, the fuel supply was likely completely exhausted during the flight, which resulted in the subsequent loss of power to both engines.
Given the circumstances of the accident, the effects from the right seat pilot’s use of cetirizine and the identified ethanol in the left seat pilot, which was likely from sources other than ingestion, did not contribute to this accident.

1124,what was the pilot's first reaction when he saw his fuel tank light,"A total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the fuel exhaustion was the fatigue fracture of an electrical wire in the tank unit or fuel transmitter, which likely resulted in an inaccurate fuel quantity indication.
 The pilot-in-command seated in the right seat was providing familiarization in the multi-engine airplane to the left seat pilot during a flight to a nearby airport for fuel. Shortly after takeoff, one of the pilots reported an engine problem and advised that they were diverting to a nearby airport. A witness along the route of flight reported hearing the engines accelerating and decelerating and then popping sounds; several witnesses near the accident site reported hearing no engine sounds. The airplane impacted a building and terrain about 10 minutes after takeoff. Very minimal fuel leakage on the ground was noted and only 23 ounces of aviation fuel were collected from the airplane’s five fuel tanks. No evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction was noted for either engine or propeller; the damage to both propellers was consistent with low-to-no power at impact.

Since the pilot could not have visually verified the fuel level in the center fuel tank because of the low quantity of fuel prior to the flight, he would have had to rely on fuel consumption calculations since fueling based on flight time and the airplane’s fuel quantity indicating system. Although the fuel quantity indications at engine start and impact could not be determined postaccident from the available evidence, if the fuel quantity reading at the start of the flight was accurate based on the amount of fuel required for engine start, taxi, run-up, takeoff, and then only to fly the accident flight duration of 10 minutes, it would have been reading between 8 and 10 gallons. It is unlikely that the pilot, who was a chief pilot of a cargo operation and tasked with familiarizing company pilots in the airplane, would have knowingly initiated the flight with an insufficient fuel load for the intended flight or with the fuel gauge accurately registering the actual fuel load that was on-board.

Examination of the tank unit, or fuel quantity transmitter, revealed that the resistance between pins A and B, which were the ends of the resistor element inside the housing, fell within specification. When monitoring the potentiometer pin C, there was no resistance, indicating an open circuit between the wiper and the resistor element. X-ray imaging revealed that the conductor of electrical wire was fractured between the end of the lugs at the wiper and for pin C. Bypassing the fractured conductor, the resistive readings followed the position of the float arm consistent with normal operation. Visual examination of the wire insulation revealed no evidence of shorting, burning or damage. Examination of the fractured electrical conductor by the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed that many of the individual wires exhibited intergranular fracture surface features with fatigue striations in various directions on some individual grains. 

It is likely that the many fatigue fractured conductor strands of the electrical wire inside the accident tank unit or fuel transmitter resulted in the fuel gauge indicating that the tanks contained more fuel than the amount that was actually on board, which resulted in inadequate fuel for the intended flight and a subsequent total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. The inaccurate fuel indication would also be consistent with the pilot’s decision to decline additional fuel before departing on the accident flight.

While the estimated fuel remaining since fueling (between 15 and 51 gallons) was substantially more than the actual amount on board at the start of the accident flight (between 8 and 10 gallons), the difference could have been caused by either not allowing the fuel to settle during fueling, and/or the operational use of the airplane. Ultimately, the fuel supply was likely completely exhausted during the flight, which resulted in the subsequent loss of power to both engines.

It is unlikely that the pilot, who was a chief pilot of a cargo operation and tasked with familiarizing company pilots in the airplane, would have knowingly initiated the flight with an insufficient fuel load for the intended flight or with the fuel gauge accurately registering the actual fuel load that was on-board.

Examination of the tank unit, or fuel quantity transmitter, revealed that the resistance between pins A and B, which were the ends of the resistor element inside the housing, fell within specification. When monitoring the potentiometer pin C, there was no resistance, indicating an open circuit between the wiper and the resistor element. X-ray imaging revealed that the conductor of electrical wire was fractured between the end of the lugs at the wiper and for pin C. Bypassing the fractured conductor, the resistive readings followed the position of the float arm consistent with normal operation. Visual examination of the wire insulation revealed no evidence of shorting, burning or damage. Examination of the fractured electrical conductor by the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed that many of the individual wires exhibited intergranular fracture surface features with fatigue striations in various directions on some individual grains. 

It is likely that the many fatigue fractured conductor strands of the electrical wire inside the accident tank unit or fuel transmitter resulted in the fuel gauge indicating that the tanks contained more fuel than the amount that was actually on board, which resulted in inadequate fuel for the intended flight and a subsequent total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. The inaccurate fuel indication would also be consistent with the pilot’s decision to decline additional fuel before departing on the accident flight.

While the estimated fuel remaining since fueling (between 15 and 51 gallons) was substantially more than the actual amount on board at the start of the accident flight (between 8 and 10 gallons), the difference could have been caused by either not allowing the fuel to settle during fueling, and/or the operational use of the airplane. Ultimately, the fuel supply was likely completely exhausted during the flight, which resulted in the subsequent loss of power to both engines.
Given the circumstances of the accident, the effects from the right seat pilot’s use of cetirizine and the identified ethanol in the left seat pilot, which was likely from sources other than ingestion, did not contribute to this accident.

 The pilot-in-command seated in the right seat was providing familiarization in the multi-engine airplane to the left seat pilot during a flight to a nearby airport for fuel. Shortly after takeoff, one of the pilots reported an engine problem and advised that they were diverting to a nearby airport. A witness along the route of flight reported hearing the engines accelerating and decelerating and then popping sounds; several witnesses near the accident site reported hearing no engine sounds. The airplane impacted a building and terrain about 10 minutes after takeoff. Very minimal fuel leakage on the ground was noted and only 23 ounces of aviation fuel were collected from the airplane’s five fuel tanks. No evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction was noted for either engine or propeller; the damage to both propellers was consistent with low-to-no power at impact.

 During the preflight inspection of the airplane, the flight instructor used the sight gauges inside the airplane to estimate that there was a total of approximately 10 to 11 gallons of fuel on board between the two wing fuel tanks. The flight instructor and the pilot receiving instruction departed and conducted maneuvers, simulated losses of engine power, and performed at least eight takeoffs and landings over the course of about 50 minutes. During a simulated loss of engine power in the airport traffic pattern, after descending to 300 ft above the ground, the pilot receiving instruction attempted to perform a go-around. The engine did not respond as expected and they performed a forced landing to a grassy area bordering the runway. During the landing attempt, the airplane impacted a taxiway marker and trees bordering the airport, resulting in substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage. The amount of fuel onboard at the time of the accident and its distribution was not determined; however, a postaccident test run of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. 
During a postaccident interview, the flight instructor estimated that the airplane’s fuel consumption was about 6 gallons per hour (gph). Review of fuel consumption data from the engine and airframe manufacturer showed that the engine could be expected to consume between 6.5 and 7.3 gallons per hour at higher power settings, and that the fuel consumption could be as much as 9.5 gallons per hour when producing full power. These fuel consumption rates did not account for fuel consumed during taxi, run up, and takeoff. 
Given the quantity of fuel onboard at the time of departure, the duration of the flight, the likely fuel consumption rate of the engine, and that the engine was successfully test run after the accident, it is likely that the loss of engine power was the result of an interruption of fuel flow to the engine; however, whether the fuel supply was completely exhausted or only the fuel in one of the tanks was exhausted could not be determined based on the available information.

These fuel consumption rates did not account for fuel consumed during taxi, run up, and takeoff. 
Given the quantity of fuel onboard at the time of departure, the duration of the flight, the likely fuel consumption rate of the engine, and that the engine was successfully test run after the accident, it is likely that the loss of engine power was the result of an interruption of fuel flow to the engine; however, whether the fuel supply was completely exhausted or only the fuel in one of the tanks was exhausted could not be determined based on the available information.

. During the preflight inspection of the airplane, the flight instructor used the sight gauges inside the airplane to estimate that there was a total of approximately 10 to 11 gallons of fuel on board between the two wing fuel tanks. The flight instructor and the pilot receiving instruction departed and conducted maneuvers, simulated losses of engine power, and performed at least eight takeoffs and landings over the course of about 50 minutes. During a simulated loss of engine power in the airport traffic pattern, after descending to 300 ft above the ground, the pilot receiving instruction attempted to perform a go-around. The engine did not respond as expected and they performed a forced landing to a grassy area bordering the runway. During the landing attempt, the airplane impacted a taxiway marker and trees bordering the airport, resulting in substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage. The amount of fuel onboard at the time of the accident and its distribution was not determined; however, a postaccident test run of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.

1136,airplane crashed because pilot was missing trim,"The pilot’s decision to depart despite a known mechanical trim malfunction and with a high-density altitude and the airplane at or above its maximum gross weight.
 The pilot reported that, during a flight on the day before the accident, a trim anomaly caused the airplane to enter a nose-down pitch attitude and descend. The pilot had to manually reset the trim position about every 8 seconds to maintain level flight and prevent the airplane from prematurely descending. After landing, the pilot had a discussion with a mechanic to troubleshoot the mechanical issue, and no anomalies were identified.
Before the accident takeoff, one of the two passengers had the airplane fueled with 20 gallons of fuel, for total fuel of 30 gallons. The pilot thought that the airplane was fueled with 12 gallons, for a total fuel of 22 gallons. This miscommunication between the pilot and passenger resulted in the airplane being fueled more than the pilot expected, which likely resulted in the airplane being near or slightly over the maximum allowable gross weight at the time of takeoff. 
The pilot performed a short-field takeoff during the accident flight. The pilot reported that, when the airplane reached an altitude of about 500 ft above ground level, he experienced an “abnormal heaviness” in the control wheel that was consistent with the pitch trim anomaly during the flight on the day before. The airplane would not climb any further, so the pilot made a left turn back to the runway, during which the airplane descended and subsequently collided with terrain. 

Postaccident examination of the trim actuator revealed an anomaly of the O-rings, which prevented the hydraulic pressure from maintaining the desired trim position. Consequently, the trim surface could move without command and could thus not hold the required takeoff position. 

In addition, the density altitude at the time of the accident takeoff was about 8,600 ft mean sea level, and the airplane was close to its maximum allowable gross weight. The effects of highdensity altitude conditions and a heavy airplane weight on takeoff performance include increased takeoff roll distance and reduced rate of climb. It is likely that while the pilot was dealing with a high-density altitude takeoff which may have affected the performance of the engine, he did not adequately monitor the trim that was not holding its required takeoff position and that he knew was malfunctioning before departure.

The airplane would not climb any further, so the pilot made a left turn back to the runway, during which the airplane descended and subsequently collided with terrain. 

Postaccident examination of the trim actuator revealed an anomaly of the O-rings, which prevented the hydraulic pressure from maintaining the desired trim position. Consequently, the trim surface could move without command and could thus not hold the required takeoff position. 

In addition, the density altitude at the time of the accident takeoff was about 8,600 ft mean sea level, and the airplane was close to its maximum allowable gross weight. The effects of highdensity altitude conditions and a heavy airplane weight on takeoff performance include increased takeoff roll distance and reduced rate of climb. It is likely that while the pilot was dealing with a high-density altitude takeoff which may have affected the performance of the engine, he did not adequately monitor the trim that was not holding its required takeoff position and that he knew was malfunctioning before departure. 
 The pilot’s decision to depart despite a known mechanical trim malfunction and with a high-density altitude and the airplane at or above its maximum gross weight.
. The pilot reported that, during a flight on the day before the accident, a trim anomaly caused the airplane to enter a nose-down pitch attitude and descend. The pilot had to manually reset the trim position about every 8 seconds to maintain level flight and prevent the airplane from prematurely descending. After landing, the pilot had a discussion with a mechanic to troubleshoot the mechanical issue, and no anomalies were identified.
Before the accident takeoff, one of the two passengers had the airplane fueled with 20 gallons of fuel, for total fuel of 30 gallons. The pilot thought that the airplane was fueled with 12 gallons, for a total fuel of 22 gallons. This miscommunication between the pilot and passenger resulted in the airplane being fueled more than the pilot expected, which likely resulted in the airplane being near or slightly over the maximum allowable gross weight at the time of takeoff.

1146,why did a plane's engine suddenly lose its power,"A total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available evidence.  
 The pilot/owner had recently purchased the experimental amateur-built airplane following a nearly decade long period of disuse. After spending several weeks inspecting the airplane and addressing minor maintenance issues, he flew the airplane for about 6 hours and noted no issues with the engine. Several days before the accident he changed the engine oil and removed about 1/2 teaspoon of carbon deposits and “sludge” from the oil screen. On the day of the accident, the pilot flew the airplane offshore and was performing maneuvers when the engine suddenly lost all power and the propeller stopped rotating. The pilot then performed a forced landing to a beach during which the and the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, resulting in substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer.
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that there was substantial oil streaking along the underside of the fuselage and that the propeller was not free to rotate without the application of additional leverage. Additionally, while the quantity of engine oil that remained was insufficient to sustain engine operation, the oil drained from the engine was absent of ferrous metal or other contaminates. Disassembly of the engine revealed that the oil pressure relief valve spring was corroded, pitted, and broken. Additionally, while internal engine components displayed signatures consistent with inadequate lubrication, no failures or damage that would have resulted in sudden engine stoppage were observed.

Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that there was substantial oil streaking along the underside of the fuselage and that the propeller was not free to rotate without the application of additional leverage. Additionally, while the quantity of engine oil that remained was insufficient to sustain engine operation, the oil drained from the engine was absent of ferrous metal or other contaminates. Disassembly of the engine revealed that the oil pressure relief valve spring was corroded, pitted, and broken. Additionally, while internal engine components displayed signatures consistent with inadequate lubrication, no failures or damage that would have resulted in sudden engine stoppage were observed.

1154,what causes engine power to be lost when i shut off accelerator and throttle,"A total loss of engine power during cruise flight due to a disconnected carburetor mixture control cable which allowed the carburetor mixture lever to migrate to the cut-off position during flight.
 The flight instructor stated that he and the pilot fueled the airplane, departed, and flew for about 1.5 hours when, while cruising at 3,500 ft, the engine “started to sputter.” He checked the magnetos, adjusted the mixture, switched fuel tanks, and pumped the primer and throttle. When he pumped the primer, the engine would “run for about 5 seconds then quit,” and the propeller continued to windmill. Unable to restore power to the engine, he elected to execute a forced landing to a field. During the landing rollout, the airplane impacted a berm resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that although the cockpit mixture knob was set to full rich, the carburetor mixture control cable was disconnected at the carburetor and the carburetor mixture lever on the carburetor was in idle cutoff position. The hardware that would have attached these components was not located. Given this information, it is likely that hardware holding the mixture control cable to the mixture control arm loosened and departed during flight, allowing the disconnected mixture control arm to migrate to the cut-off position, resulting in a total loss of engine power. Since both the accelerator pump and the primer system bypass the carburetor and delivers some fuel directly to the engine even when the mixture control is in the “cutoff” position, this would explain why the instructor reported momentary bursts of power when he pumped the primer or throttle.

1160,what medications were in the plane when it crashed,"The pilot's loss of airplane control while maneuvering at a low altitude. 
 While flying to his private, home airfield, the pilot overflew at low altitude an area of land owned by his family. Witnesses described the first “pass” over a nearby pond as “low” at an estimated 60 ft above the ground. One witness described the low-altitude flight as being a typical “fly by” maneuver that the pilot would perform upon returning home. After the first pass, the pilot performed a left circling turn and another pass over the pond. During the second pass, a witness reported that the altitude was about 50 ft above the ground, and as the airplane flew between groups of trees, the right wing was pointed “almost straight up in the air” before the airplane descended and impacted the ground. The description of the right wing pointing upward is consistent with an extreme left roll attitude and is likely indicative of a loss of control that was possibly a result of intentional maneuvering as part of the “fly-by” or due to a sudden maneuver to avoid an obstacle (such as trees). 

A postaccident examination of the airframe revealed no preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Water and impact damage prevented a thorough examination of the engine; however, a witnesses described the engine noise as “steady” prior to impact. That, along with the twisting damage exhibited by both propeller blades, suggest that the engine was likely operating at the time of the accident. 

The pilot’s toxicological test results were positive for antidepressant and allergy medications. The antidepressant was not detected in blood and therefore was likely below therapeutic levels. While there were no medical records available to evaluate the severity of the pilot’s depression and when he was diagnosed, by the accounts provided, the pilot was not exhibiting any unusual behavior; while the low fly-by homecoming was not a safe procedure, it was the pilot’s usual habit when returning to his home airfield. The concentration of allergy medication was not listed in the test results, suggesting that the levels were below therapeutic levels. 

While the pilot appears to have taken two medications that can have impairing effects and may have had a psychological condition that could decrease performance, given the circumstances of this accident and the concentrations of the medications detected, it is unlikely that effects from the pilot’s use of citalopram and cetirizine or his depression were factors in the accident.

"
1162,what was the cause of an airplane accident,"The pilot’s improper preflight fuel planning, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s decision to continue to the destination following the loss of engine power to the first engine.
 The pilot of the on-demand passenger flight about 10 to 15 miles from the destination when the twin-engine airplane’s left engine stopped producing power. The pilot opened the fuel cross-feed valve, switched on both fuel boost pumps, and restored power to the left engine. The pilot continued to the original destination rather than land at a closer airport because he believed that the right engine fuel gauge indicated adequate fuel to complete the flight. When the airplane was on a left base leg for landing, both engines lost total power.
The pilot made a forced landing on the grass between the runway and a taxiway, during which the airplane was substantially damaged. Postaccident examination of the airplane found that all of the fuel tanks were intact and empty of useable fuel. When the fuel system was tested, no leaks or other mechanical deficiencies were observed that would have precluded normal operation at the time of the accident.
The airplane’s inboard fuel tanks had most recently been topped off 3 days before the accident (the outboard tanks were kept empty for weight reasons), after which the pilot performed a round trip passenger flight. Before the accident flight, the pilot did not visually check the fuel level in fuel tanks as prescribed by the preflight checklist. He stated that the fuel gauges, which he did not believe were accurate, indicated that the inboard tanks were more than half full. Based on his previous experience with the airplane’s typical fuel consumption, he estimated that he had about 2 hours of fuel remaining onboard the airplane to complete the planned round-trip flight, plus a 30-minute reserve. Following the accident, the pilot stated that he was “stubbornly overconfident” that there was enough fuel to complete the flight and, based on his extensive experience flying the airplane, he calculated a fuel consumption of 40 gallons per hour (gph); but he admitted that he should have calculated a fuel consumption of 50 gph. 
Based on the lack of fuel in the fuel tanks after the accident, as well as the confirmed postaccident integrity of the fuel system, it is likely that the pilot’s failure to verify the quantity of fuel onboard the airplane prior to the flight and his miscalculation of the airplane’s fuel consumption rate resulted in fuel exhaustion and the subsequent total loss of engine power. The accident likely also could have been avoided if the pilot landed immediately after the first loss of engine power rather than continuing to the originally planned destination.
Based on available medical and operational evidence, it is unlikely that the pilot’s diagnosed tremors or other medical conditions contributed to the accident. There was no evidence that the pilot’s use of medications or alcohol contributed to the accident; however, available evidence was limited and did not include postaccident toxicology results.

Following the accident, the pilot stated that he was “stubbornly overconfident” that there was enough fuel to complete the flight and, based on his extensive experience flying the airplane, he calculated a fuel consumption of 40 gallons per hour (gph); but he admitted that he should have calculated a fuel consumption of 50 gph. 
Based on the lack of fuel in the fuel tanks after the accident, as well as the confirmed postaccident integrity of the fuel system, it is likely that the pilot’s failure to verify the quantity of fuel onboard the airplane prior to the flight and his miscalculation of the airplane’s fuel consumption rate resulted in fuel exhaustion and the subsequent total loss of engine power. The accident likely also could have been avoided if the pilot landed immediately after the first loss of engine power rather than continuing to the originally planned destination.
Based on available medical and operational evidence, it is unlikely that the pilot’s diagnosed tremors or other medical conditions contributed to the accident. There was no evidence that the pilot’s use of medications or alcohol contributed to the accident; however, available evidence was limited and did not include postaccident toxicology results.

1169,what was the pilot s reaction to the fuel tank full,"The pilot’s improper preflight fuel planning, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s decision to continue to the destination following the loss of engine power to the first engine.
 The pilot of the on-demand passenger flight about 10 to 15 miles from the destination when the twin-engine airplane’s left engine stopped producing power. The pilot opened the fuel cross-feed valve, switched on both fuel boost pumps, and restored power to the left engine. The pilot continued to the original destination rather than land at a closer airport because he believed that the right engine fuel gauge indicated adequate fuel to complete the flight. When the airplane was on a left base leg for landing, both engines lost total power.
The pilot made a forced landing on the grass between the runway and a taxiway, during which the airplane was substantially damaged. Postaccident examination of the airplane found that all of the fuel tanks were intact and empty of useable fuel. When the fuel system was tested, no leaks or other mechanical deficiencies were observed that would have precluded normal operation at the time of the accident.
The airplane’s inboard fuel tanks had most recently been topped off 3 days before the accident (the outboard tanks were kept empty for weight reasons), after which the pilot performed a round trip passenger flight. Before the accident flight, the pilot did not visually check the fuel level in fuel tanks as prescribed by the preflight checklist. He stated that the fuel gauges, which he did not believe were accurate, indicated that the inboard tanks were more than half full. Based on his previous experience with the airplane’s typical fuel consumption, he estimated that he had about 2 hours of fuel remaining onboard the airplane to complete the planned round-trip flight, plus a 30-minute reserve. Following the accident, the pilot stated that he was “stubbornly overconfident” that there was enough fuel to complete the flight and, based on his extensive experience flying the airplane, he calculated a fuel consumption of 40 gallons per hour (gph); but he admitted that he should have calculated a fuel consumption of 50 gph. 
Based on the lack of fuel in the fuel tanks after the accident, as well as the confirmed postaccident integrity of the fuel system, it is likely that the pilot’s failure to verify the quantity of fuel onboard the airplane prior to the flight and his miscalculation of the airplane’s fuel consumption rate resulted in fuel exhaustion and the subsequent total loss of engine power. The accident likely also could have been avoided if the pilot landed immediately after the first loss of engine power rather than continuing to the originally planned destination.

1170,what was the color of the fuel that was in the aircraft,"The total loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on the available information.
 The pilot of the experimental, amateur-built airplane reported that he remained in the airport traffic pattern after departure and, while turning from base to final during landing, the engine lost total power. The airplane impacted terrain short of the runway and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. The pilot provided conflicting statements regarding which fuel tank was selected at the time of the accident, and also drained fuel from the tanks before the airplane was examined; therefore, the amount of fuel onboard at the time of the accident was not determined. 
Examination of the fuel system confirmed continuity from each tank to the fuel selector. The exterior of the gascolator exhibited a green film that saturated the fuel line from the gascolator to the engine-driven fuel pump. The fuel line from the gascolator to the carburetor was disconnected and purged. With the fuel selector in the right tank position, no fuel could be extracted from the fuel line. With the fuel selector in the left tank position, about 1 pint of a lime green-colored substance was purged from the fuel line. Examination of the throttle body also revealed the presence of the lime green substance. The liquid was consistent with 100LL aviation fuel; however, the lead content was higher than specification, which may have been the result of a lead-scavenging additive that the pilot used. The reason for its abnormal color could not be determined with the sample amount available.
The wreckage was released to the pilot, who reported that he tested the ignition system and suggested that a coil selector anomaly may have resulted in the loss of power. However, his test was incomplete and unconfirmed. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined based on available evidence.

1172,can fuel pressure affect power of airplane,"A partial loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. 
 The pilot reported that before takeoff for the personal flight, he performed an engine run-up, which included a check of the magnetos, carburetor heat, fuel pressure, oil pressure, and oil temperature. After takeoff, at an altitude of about 500 ft mean sea level (msl), he checked the instruments, which “looked good,” and the airplane was climbing about 500 ft per minute. About 600 ft msl, the airplane “didn’t feel right,” and he noticed a “significant loss of power.” He then lowered the nose to gain speed; however, the airplane did not gain speed and started to descend. He selected a location for an off-airport landing. The airplane landed in a wooded area of 4- to 8-ft-tall pine trees and sustained substantial damage to both wings. 

The weather conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to the accumulation of carburetor ice at glide power settings. However, the pilot applied the carburetor heat during the engine run-up just before takeoff, which should have either melted any minor ice that may have accumulated on the ground or resulted in a rough running engine, which the pilot did not report. The application of carburetor heat during the run-up combined with the high power setting during takeoff and initial climb reduced the likelihood of carburetor ice.

The most significant finding of a postaccident examination of the engine included that there was a hole in the left exhaust riser, and an accumulation of soot in the carburetor heat muff and tubing, airbox, and carburetor throat. This was indicative of exhaust gases leaking into the carburetor heat and engine induction systems. However, the pilot did note any anomalies during the engine runup and test of carburetor heat function and did not report activating the carburetor heat during the accident takeoff or subsequent forced landing. Given this information, it could not be definitively determined what role the exhaust leak played in the loss of engine power during the accident flight.

After takeoff, at an altitude of about 500 ft mean sea level (msl), he checked the instruments, which “looked good,” and the airplane was climbing about 500 ft per minute. About 600 ft msl, the airplane “didn’t feel right,” and he noticed a “significant loss of power.” He then lowered the nose to gain speed; however, the airplane did not gain speed and started to descend. He selected a location for an off-airport landing. The airplane landed in a wooded area of 4- to 8-ft-tall pine trees and sustained substantial damage to both wings. 

The weather conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to the accumulation of carburetor ice at glide power settings. However, the pilot applied the carburetor heat during the engine run-up just before takeoff, which should have either melted any minor ice that may have accumulated on the ground or resulted in a rough running engine, which the pilot did not report. The application of carburetor heat during the run-up combined with the high power setting during takeoff and initial climb reduced the likelihood of carburetor ice.

The most significant finding of a postaccident examination of the engine included that there was a hole in the left exhaust riser, and an accumulation of soot in the carburetor heat muff and tubing, airbox, and carburetor throat. This was indicative of exhaust gases leaking into the carburetor heat and engine induction systems. However, the pilot did note any anomalies during the engine runup and test of carburetor heat function and did not report activating the carburetor heat during the accident takeoff or subsequent forced landing. Given this information, it could not be definitively determined what role the exhaust leak played in the loss of engine power during the accident flight.

Based on available evidence, the reason for the partial loss of engine power could not be determined.

1180,how did the accessory gear in the plane cause the power loss,"The total loss of engine power due to an accessory drive gear that backed out impeding the other gears.
 Shortly after takeoff, the airplane’s engine experienced a total loss of power. Unable to restore engine power and at low altitude, the pilot performed a forced landing to a field. Examination of the engine found the accessory drive gears would not rotate when the propeller was turned. The reason the gears would not rotate was not located during that examination. After the airplane was released, a salvage facility performed a complete teardown of the engine and informed the pilot’s mechanic that one of the accessory drive gears appeared to have backed out which impeded the other gears. While likely this was the cause of the engine power loss, no further information and could not be obtained.

1184,why did the cyprus cbr helicopter burn out,"A partial loss of engine power due to a leak in the fuel cell outlet valve.
 While conducting wildlife damage management operations at low altitude over hilly terrain, the pilot of the helicopter noted a loss of main rotor rpm. To regain main rotor rpm, he reduced the engine power demand by descending into a draw; however, the helicopter impacted terrain, rolled over, and came to rest on its left side. Two days before the accident flight, the pilot experienced a similar loss of main rotor rpm; however, he was able to safely land the helicopter. The pilot was unable to replicate the loss of main rotor rpm and continued the flight. The pilot believed that the event was an isolated anomaly and did not notify maintenance personnel. 
Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed an air leak located in the fuel cell outlet valve near the firewall. Subsequent examination of the fuel cell outlet valve revealed circumferential scratch marks around the barrel of the pipe. Damage due to cross-threading was observed on the first two threads. When the O-ring was removed, metal chips were located embedded throughout the O-ring. A review of the maintenance records indicated that the fuel system components were inspected during the 100-hour inspection, along with correspondence from the maintenance facility that a vacuum check of the fuel system was conducted during that inspection, with no anomalies noted. No entries were found in the maintenance records of any work done to the fuel outlet valve. The approved maintenance manual for the helicopter contained multiple warnings that air in the fuel system will cause a power reduction or flame out. It could not be determined when, or how, the fuel cell outlet valve developed a leak.

Two days before the accident flight, the pilot experienced a similar loss of main rotor rpm; however, he was able to safely land the helicopter. The pilot was unable to replicate the loss of main rotor rpm and continued the flight. The pilot believed that the event was an isolated anomaly and did not notify maintenance personnel. 
Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed an air leak located in the fuel cell outlet valve near the firewall. Subsequent examination of the fuel cell outlet valve revealed circumferential scratch marks around the barrel of the pipe. Damage due to cross-threading was observed on the first two threads. When the O-ring was removed, metal chips were located embedded throughout the O-ring. A review of the maintenance records indicated that the fuel system components were inspected during the 100-hour inspection, along with correspondence from the maintenance facility that a vacuum check of the fuel system was conducted during that inspection, with no anomalies noted. No entries were found in the maintenance records of any work done to the fuel outlet valve. The approved maintenance manual for the helicopter contained multiple warnings that air in the fuel system will cause a power reduction or flame out. It could not be determined when, or how, the fuel cell outlet valve developed a leak.

1192,what is the purpose of the ram air breather tube on the airplane,"The inadequate maintenance/inspection of the airplane, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to oil starvation.  

 The pilot stated that, during climb from the departure airport, the engine made a loud growling noise, lost power, and began producing smoke. The pilot then performed a forced landing on a road, during which the airplane nosed over and impacted terrain. 

Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed a hole in the crankcase and a failure of two cylinders consistent with oil starvation. The majority of oil residue was located below and aft of the oil breather tube, which was to alleviate normal crankcase pressures. The crankcase nose seal exhibited an oil leak that would have also allowed ram air pressure to pressurize the crankcase above normal pressures and force engine oil out through the oil breather tube resulting in oil starvation/exhaustion. Oil leakage from the crankcase breather tube would have been progressive and not instantaneous. The oil leakage from the crankcase nose seal and breather tube should have been identified by those performing maintenance and/or preflight inspections of the airplane after seeing decreased oil levels, oil residue external to the engine, and seepage from the crankcase nose seal.

1212,what type of fuel did a pilot use during the accident,"A total loss of engine power during cruise flight due to a fatigue crack in the No. 3 cylinder connecting rod shaft resulting from either preignition or detonation, which resulted in a forced landing and impact with terrain.  
 The pilot receiving instruction and flight instructor had planned a local instructional flight on the day of the accident. Shortly into the flight after they reached their cruise flight altitude, they experienced a total loss of engine power. The airplane was substantially damaged during a forced landing in a field. 

Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the connecting rod shaft for the No. 3 cylinder had fractured due to fatigue cracking. The buildup of combustion deposits suggested the event was caused by either preignition or detonation or both, which would have been the result of the use of a lower grade fuel or operating the engine at high power settings with an excessively lean mixture. 

Although a trace amount of automotive fuel was detected in the fuel line to the carburetor, fuel records indicate that the pilot had been using 100LL consistently. The operating fuel used by the previous owner is unknown; however, the previous owner implied that he used 100LL during conversations with the current owner. The pilot’s leaning practices showed that he regularly leaned the mixture to reach best rpm and enrichened three turns.

1220,what is the ground speed of an airplane when it hits ice,"The pilot’s improper decision to continue flight in an area of moderate-to-heavy icing conditions, which resulted in exceedance of the airplane’s anti-icing system capabilities, a degradation of aircraft performance, and subsequent aerodynamic stall. 

 The pilot was conducting an instrument flight rules cross-country flight and climbing to a planned altitude of 23,000 ft mean sea level (msl). According to air traffic control data, as the airplane climbed through 18,600 ft msl, its groundspeed was 171 knots, and a gradual reduction in groundspeed began. After reaching an altitude of about 20,200 ft msl, the airplane began a descent on a southeast heading. Just before the descent began, the airplane’s groundspeed had decreased to 145 knots. About 2 minutes after the descent began, the airplane turned right to a northeast heading on which it continued for about 30 seconds. The flightpath then became erratic before the data ended. The pilot made no distress calls and did not respond to repeated calls from the controller.

The main wreckage of the airplane was located in densely forested terrain at an elevation of about 930 ft about 1,000 ft south of the last radar return. The outboard portion of the right wing, right aileron, right horizontal stabilizer, and right elevator were not located with the main wreckage and, despite ground and aerial searches with a small unmanned aircraft system, were not found. Examination of the wreckage indicated that the missing wing and tail sections separated in flight due to overload. Examination of the recovered airframe and engine did not reveal evidence of any pre-existing mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.

Weather forecasts indicated that the accident site was in an area where moderate icing conditions up to 25,000 ft msl, embedded thunderstorms, and 2-inch hail were forecasted. Review of preflight weather information received by the pilot indicated that he was aware of the conditions forecast on the route of flight before initiating the flight. Meteorological data revealed that the airplane likely entered icing conditions that ranged from light to heavy as it climbed through 14,000 ft msl about 23 minutes after takeoff and remained in icing conditions for the remaining 16-minute duration of the flight. Freezing drizzle conditions were likely present along the flightpath. 
Although the airplane was equipped for flight in icing conditions, the pilot’s operating handbook contained a warning about flight into severe icing conditions, which stated that flight in freezing drizzle could result in ice build-up on protected surfaces exceeding the capability of the ice protection system. The airplane’s gradual loss of groundspeed as it climbed was consistent with ice accumulating on the airplane. It is likely that during the 16 minutes the airplane was operating in icing conditions, the capability of the ice protection system was exceeded, which resulted in a degradation of aircraft performance and subsequent aerodynamic stall. During the ensuing uncontrolled descent, the structural capability of the airplane was exceeded, which resulted in an inflight break up. 

A review of the pilot’s records revealed multiple certificate application failures for reasons that included inadequate knowledge of cross-country flight planning, aircraft performance, and stalls. Review of the pilot’s airman knowledge written tests found areas answered incorrectly over multiple exams included meteorology, aircraft performance, aeronautical decisionmaking, and stalls.

The ethanol identified in the pilot’s cavity blood was most likely the result of postmortem production. Therefore, effects from ethanol did not play any role in this accident.

The cargo was documented as it was removed from the airplane and remained secure until after it was weighed. Based upon the weight of the cargo, passengers, airplane, and fuel from the filed flight plan, at the time of departure, the airplane would have been about 361 lbs over maximum gross weight. According to the FAA Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, an overloaded airplane “may exhibit unexpected and unusually poor flight characteristics,” which include reduced maneuverability and an increased stall speed.

. The pilot was conducting an instrument flight rules cross-country flight and climbing to a planned altitude of 23,000 ft mean sea level (msl). According to air traffic control data, as the airplane climbed through 18,600 ft msl, its groundspeed was 171 knots, and a gradual reduction in groundspeed began. After reaching an altitude of about 20,200 ft msl, the airplane began a descent on a southeast heading. Just before the descent began, the airplane’s groundspeed had decreased to 145 knots. About 2 minutes after the descent began, the airplane turned right to a northeast heading on which it continued for about 30 seconds. The flightpath then became erratic before the data ended.

1226,what types of clouds are in the misty fjords,"The pilot’s decision to continue visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), which resulted in controlled flight into terrain. Contributing to the accident was the FAA’s reliance on voluntary compliance with the Ketchikan Operator’s Letter of Agreement. 
 The accident flight was the pilot’s second passenger sightseeing flight of the day that overflew 
remote inland fjords, coastal waterways, and mountainous, tree-covered terrain in the Misty Fjords National Monument. Limited information was available about the airplane’s flight track due to radar limitations, and the flight tracking information from the airplane only provided data in 1-minute intervals. The data indicated that the airplane was on the return leg of the flight and in the final minutes of flight, the pilot was flying on the right side of a valley. The airplane impacted mountainous terrain at 1,750 ft mean sea level (msl), about 250 ft below the summit.

Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of preaccident failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Damage to the propeller indicated that it was rotating and under power at the time of the accident. The orientation and distribution of the wreckage indicated that the airplane impacted a tree in a left-wing-low attitude, likely as the pilot was attempting to maneuver away from terrain. 

Review of weather information for the day of the accident revealed a conditionally unstable environment below 6,000 ft msl, which led to rain organizing in bands of shower activity. Satellite imagery depicted that one of these bands was moving northeastward across the accident site at the accident time. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) weather cameras and local weather observations also indicated that lower visibility and mountain obscuration conditions were progressing northward across the accident area with time. Based on photographs recovered from passenger cell phones along with FAA weather camera imagery, the accident flight encountered mountain obscuration conditions, rain shower activity, and reduced visibilities and cloud ceilings, resulting in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) before the impact with terrain. 

The pilot reviewed weather conditions before the first flight of the day; however, there was no indication that he obtained updated weather conditions or additional weather information before departing on the accident flight. Based on interviews, the accident pilot landed following the first flight of the day in lowering visibility, ceiling, and precipitation, and departed on the accident flight in precipitation, based on passenger photos. Therefore, the pilot had knowledge of the weather conditions that he could have encountered along the route of flight before departure.

The operator had adequate policies and procedures in place for pilots regarding inadvertent encounters with IMC; however, the pilot’s training records indicated that he was signed off for cue-based training that did not occur. Cue-based training is intended to help calibrate pilots’ weather assessment and foster an ability to accurately assess and respond appropriately to cues associated with deteriorating weather. Had the pilot completed the training, it might have helped improve his decision-making skills to either cancel the flight before departure or turn around earlier in the flight. The operator’s lack of safety management protocols resulted in the pilot not receiving the required cue-based training, allowed him to continue operating air tours with minimal remedial training following a previous accident, and allowed the accident airplane to operate without a valid FAA registration. 

The operator was signatory to a voluntary local air tour operator’s group letter of agreement that was developed to improve the overall safety of flight operations in the area of the Misty Fjords National Monument. Participation was voluntary and not regulated by the FAA, and the investigation noted multiple instances in which the LOA policies were ignored, including on the accident flight. For example, the accident flight did not follow the standard Misty Fjords route outlined in the LOA nor did it comply with the recommended altitudes for flights into and out of the Misty Fjords.

 The pilot’s decision to continue visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), which resulted in controlled flight into terrain. Contributing to the accident was the FAA’s reliance on voluntary compliance with the Ketchikan Operator’s Letter of Agreement. 
. The accident flight was the pilot’s second passenger sightseeing flight of the day that overflew 
remote inland fjords, coastal waterways, and mountainous, tree-covered terrain in the Misty Fjords National Monument. Limited information was available about the airplane’s flight track due to radar limitations, and the flight tracking information from the airplane only provided data in 1-minute intervals. The data indicated that the airplane was on the return leg of the flight and in the final minutes of flight, the pilot was flying on the right side of a valley. The airplane impacted mountainous terrain at 1,750 ft mean sea level (msl), about 250 ft below the summit.

Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of preaccident failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Damage to the propeller indicated that it was rotating and under power at the time of the accident. The orientation and distribution of the wreckage indicated that the airplane impacted a tree in a left-wing-low attitude, likely as the pilot was attempting to maneuver away from terrain. 

Review of weather information for the day of the accident revealed a conditionally unstable environment below 6,000 ft msl, which led to rain organizing in bands of shower activity. Satellite imagery depicted that one of these bands was moving northeastward across the accident site at the accident time. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) weather cameras and local weather observations also indicated that lower visibility and mountain obscuration conditions were progressing northward across the accident area with time. Based on photographs recovered from passenger cell phones along with FAA weather camera imagery, the accident flight encountered mountain obscuration conditions, rain shower activity, and reduced visibilities and cloud ceilings, resulting in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) before the impact with terrain. 

The pilot reviewed weather conditions before the first flight of the day; however, there was no indication that he obtained updated weather conditions or additional weather information before departing on the accident flight. Based on interviews, the accident pilot landed following the first flight of the day in lowering visibility, ceiling, and precipitation, and departed on the accident flight in precipitation, based on passenger photos. Therefore, the pilot had knowledge of the weather conditions that he could have encountered along the route of flight before departure.

The operator had adequate policies and procedures in place for pilots regarding inadvertent encounters with IMC; however, the pilot’s training records indicated that he was signed off for cue-based training that did not occur. Cue-based training is intended to help calibrate pilots’ weather assessment and foster an ability to accurately assess and respond appropriately to cues associated with deteriorating weather. Had the pilot completed the training, it might have helped improve his decision-making skills to either cancel the flight before departure or turn around earlier in the flight. The operator’s lack of safety management protocols resulted in the pilot not receiving the required cue-based training, allowed him to continue operating air tours with minimal remedial training following a previous accident, and allowed the accident airplane to operate without a valid FAA registration. 

The operator was signatory to a voluntary local air tour operator’s group letter of agreement that was developed to improve the overall safety of flight operations in the area of the Misty Fjords National Monument. Participation was voluntary and not regulated by the FAA, and the investigation noted multiple instances in which the LOA policies were ignored, including on the accident flight. For example, the accident flight did not follow the standard Misty Fjords route outlined in the LOA nor did it comply with the recommended altitudes for flights into and out of the Misty Fjords.

FAA inspectors providing oversight for the area reported that, when they addressed operators about disregarding the LOA, the operators would respond that the LOA was voluntary and that they did not need to follow the guidance. The FAA’s reliance on voluntary compliance initiatives in the local air tour industry failed to produce compliance with safety initiatives or to reduce accidents in the Ketchikan region.

1231,what flight went off the runway and hit the tree in the misty fjords,"The pilot’s decision to continue visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), which resulted in controlled flight into terrain. Contributing to the accident was the FAA’s reliance on voluntary compliance with the Ketchikan Operator’s Letter of Agreement. 
 The accident flight was the pilot’s second passenger sightseeing flight of the day that overflew 
remote inland fjords, coastal waterways, and mountainous, tree-covered terrain in the Misty Fjords National Monument. Limited information was available about the airplane’s flight track due to radar limitations, and the flight tracking information from the airplane only provided data in 1-minute intervals. The data indicated that the airplane was on the return leg of the flight and in the final minutes of flight, the pilot was flying on the right side of a valley. The airplane impacted mountainous terrain at 1,750 ft mean sea level (msl), about 250 ft below the summit.

Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of preaccident failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. Damage to the propeller indicated that it was rotating and under power at the time of the accident. The orientation and distribution of the wreckage indicated that the airplane impacted a tree in a left-wing-low attitude, likely as the pilot was attempting to maneuver away from terrain. 

Review of weather information for the day of the accident revealed a conditionally unstable environment below 6,000 ft msl, which led to rain organizing in bands of shower activity. Satellite imagery depicted that one of these bands was moving northeastward across the accident site at the accident time. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) weather cameras and local weather observations also indicated that lower visibility and mountain obscuration conditions were progressing northward across the accident area with time. Based on photographs recovered from passenger cell phones along with FAA weather camera imagery, the accident flight encountered mountain obscuration conditions, rain shower activity, and reduced visibilities and cloud ceilings, resulting in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) before the impact with terrain. 

The pilot reviewed weather conditions before the first flight of the day; however, there was no indication that he obtained updated weather conditions or additional weather information before departing on the accident flight. Based on interviews, the accident pilot landed following the first flight of the day in lowering visibility, ceiling, and precipitation, and departed on the accident flight in precipitation, based on passenger photos. Therefore, the pilot had knowledge of the weather conditions that he could have encountered along the route of flight before departure.

The operator had adequate policies and procedures in place for pilots regarding inadvertent encounters with IMC; however, the pilot’s training records indicated that he was signed off for cue-based training that did not occur. Cue-based training is intended to help calibrate pilots’ weather assessment and foster an ability to accurately assess and respond appropriately to cues associated with deteriorating weather. Had the pilot completed the training, it might have helped improve his decision-making skills to either cancel the flight before departure or turn around earlier in the flight. The operator’s lack of safety management protocols resulted in the pilot not receiving the required cue-based training, allowed him to continue operating air tours with minimal remedial training following a previous accident, and allowed the accident airplane to operate without a valid FAA registration. 

The operator was signatory to a voluntary local air tour operator’s group letter of agreement that was developed to improve the overall safety of flight operations in the area of the Misty Fjords National Monument. Participation was voluntary and not regulated by the FAA, and the investigation noted multiple instances in which the LOA policies were ignored, including on the accident flight.

 After a normal takeoff, the pilot encountered low clouds en route to his destination. He diverted to a nearby airport and avoided the clouds as he descended toward the airport. He entered a downwind for the runway and reduced the engine to a low power setting. After turning final, the pilot attempted to add power; however, the engine did not respond. He manipulated the throttle several times, but the engine did not increase from idle power. The pilot initiated a landing to a nearby field. The airplane touched down hard, the nose gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest. 

During an on-scene examination, the fuel selector was found positioned on the left tank. About 3 inches of fuel was observed in the right-wing fuel tank, and no visible fuel was noted in the left-wing fuel tank. During a discussion with the pilot, he reported that the airplane was on the right fuel tank when the loss of power occurred. 

After recovery, a temporary fuel tank was connected to the fuel line at the left-wing root to facilitate an engine run. The airplane started and operated uneventfully at various engine speeds with no anomalies noted. Since the engine operated normally postaccident, and fuel was present in the right fuel tank, it is likely the engine was starved of fuel during the accident flight, which resulted in a loss of engine power.

The airplane started and operated uneventfully at various engine speeds with no anomalies noted. Since the engine operated normally postaccident, and fuel was present in the right fuel tank, it is likely the engine was starved of fuel during the accident flight, which resulted in a loss of engine power.

1238,where is the fuel selector on an airplane,"A partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined based on available evidence. 
  
 After a normal takeoff, the pilot encountered low clouds en route to his destination. He diverted to a nearby airport and avoided the clouds as he descended toward the airport. He entered a downwind for the runway and reduced the engine to a low power setting. After turning final, the pilot attempted to add power; however, the engine did not respond. He manipulated the throttle several times, but the engine did not increase from idle power. The pilot initiated a landing to a nearby field. The airplane touched down hard, the nose gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest. 

During an on-scene examination, the fuel selector was found positioned on the left tank. About 3 inches of fuel was observed in the right-wing fuel tank, and no visible fuel was noted in the left-wing fuel tank. During a discussion with the pilot, he reported that the airplane was on the right fuel tank when the loss of power occurred.

One can deduce, however, that most incidents happen during some sort of dynamic operation. Hypergols tend to be very stable in a static configuration (as long as the compatibility characteristics have been well addressed). An effort should be made to allow for multiple “sets of eyes” to study hypergol system designs, procedures, system configurations, and training plans.). In several of the incidents advance warning (prior to any liquid or vapor release) was available to the technicians in the vicinity of the spill and/or the engineers that were monitoring from a remote location. The warning indications include off-nominal data (remote or local), off-nominal system characteristics, and/or local changes that occurred without human intervention. Some of these went unnoticed or were ignored during the operation, thus resulting in an incident. There was advance warning in 19 out of 38 total incidents (50% of the time). This percentage does not include spilled fuel as an advance warning of a fire (five occurrences). Depending on the local environment, there is a reasonable probability that if hydrazine (or one of its derivatives) is spilled, there will be a fire; therefore, the fuel spill itself could be considered an advance warning of a fuel fire. Roughly 42% of the documented fuel spills studied resulted in a fire or explosion. It could not be determined if there was an advanced warning for two of the incidents; therefore, they were not included in the above percentage along with the mentioned five fuel spills.

The lessons learned and the JPL approach should be considered a model for how NASA should work with vendors in the future. From the JPL-Deep Space Atomic Clock best practices that apply to these lessons: • Pre-Qualify vendors that have both a low-rate, R&D capability as well as a high-rate production side. o Fund the vendor to assess their current processes for applicability to new work. o Don't compete process development unless you have a huge flight quantity order. • View the vendor as a development partner. Their success is your success, and vice versa. • Use multiple vendors for process development to maximize potential for success. o This requires additional and focused team support for each vendor • Interface with the vendor at the detailed engineering level. Don't depend on high-level company contacts, especially for highly technical discussions. • Structure Sub-Contracts or PO's such that NASA owns the resulting development process. o This may seem to cost more, but it lessens the difficulty with cross-fertilization of knowledge between vendors and enables more flexibility later on in competing brazing services using the developed process. • Use specific, step-wise PO's or contract deliverables to work through the Non-recurring engineering (NRE) portion. o Predicate flight deliverables on success during NRE work. o This moves the risk to NASA, which is advantageous for small, specialized vendors. • Use ample runs of coupons to be evaluated by both vendor and NASA. • Execute tight team coordination between vendor and NASA (weekly) during NRE phases. • Interact with vendor's 3rd tier vendors to ensure the process will not be sub-sub-contracted. In summary, this team of SMEs uncovered a common thread throughout most of the projects assessed – the lack of brazing development can result in inadequate process results and substandard parts. Brazing is a very specific, potentially complex process that is also extremely useful to join materials. Brazing cannot and should not be viewed as the best, lowest cost process for all applications. Mechanical joints, welded joints, or the elimination of joints in addition to brazing must be considered in the design. As a side note, after addressing these aforementioned issues, it might be a misnomer to refer to this team as a ''tiger team\". It is recommended that this team of brazing SMEs be referred as the Brazing Investigation and Response Team (BIRT).

All SOHO procedures modified since launch should be identified and subjected to a thorough review of the changes made and their verification and validation status. The review should be led by ESA and supported by MMS, NASA, and the FOT. This review should be completed before the resumption of routine operations. If there is any doubt about a procedure, it should be re-validated. PROCEDURE IMPLEMENTATION NASA should perform an immediate comprehensive audit of all ISTP on-going flight operations activities to assess conformance to contractual requirements addressing areas such as leadership, configuration management, roles/responsibilities, anomaly handling, and general procedure implementation and validation. The activities pertinent to SOHO should include ESA in the review. ESA and NASA should review the decision authority for real-time divergence from agreed upon ground or spacecraft procedures. In the event that a problem is encountered during any procedure execution, the decision authority for the subsequent action must be clearly defined. Spacecraft safety must never be compromised. It is critical that NASA should review the relevance of selected metrics to determine adequacy for contractor performance evaluation. MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE AND PROCESS ESA and NASA should review the allocation of their responsibilities for the operation of the SOHO mission, as defined in the STSP MOU, Program Plan, and SOHO Mission Management Plan. Assessment should be made as to how these responsibilities have been undertaken by both parties. Changes should be proposed and implemented where appropriate. In particular, ESA's responsibilities for the technical integrity and safety of the spacecraft and science instrumentation and NASA's responsibilities for Ground Segment infrastructure and the conduct of the mission in accordance with the approved Flight Operations Plan should receive critical focus. This review should be preceded by internal reviews in both Agencies and completed prior to return to normal operations. It is anticipated that the review should result in an improved Mission Management Plan. ESA and NASA should re-assess staffing to ensure it is commensurate with the complexity and criticality of the SOHO mission and consistent with the updated Mission Management Plan. The staffing should be strengthened as required. Surge capability should exist to support non-routine and contingency operations. NASA should perform a risk-based analysis of operations plans to determine the level of insight/oversight appropriate for joint, cooperative, and PI missions with special attention to accountability. GROUND SYSTEMS All operational timelines should be planned and validated well before implementation with proper attention to risk assessment and contingency planning. The operations scripts (the string of procedures used by the FOT) for other than routine science operations should be put under configuration control and any change formally approved by ESA and NASA. Each time such a script is changed, the whole script should be validated. Flight operations should verify response to spacecraft configuration changes and critical commands to ensure proper execution. Flight operations should verify configuration prior to initiating critical spacecraft activity to ensure it is consistent with planned events. ESA/ESOC should lead an independent assessment of the capabilities of the NASA SOHO simulator and provide recommendations for suggested maintenance and enhancements. The FOT should review the current database to ensure that all critical parameters are flagged as out-of-limits (and preserved) if they violate values as defined in the ESA provided satellite users manual. If possible, automatic monitoring should be extended to all telemetry. An ESA and NASA board should review all outstanding Ground System Problem Reports and the plans to close them. ESA and NASA flight operations personnel should be conversant with both the ESA and NASA systems to the maximum extent possible to form a more synergistic, integrated team.", "label": [[622, 628, "REC"], [660, 685, "REC"], [687, 715, "REC"], [717, 758, "REC"], [760, 779, "REC"], [781, 817, "REC"], [819, 839, "REC"], [841, 884, "REC"], [904, 925, "REC"], [1260, 1326, "REC"], [1400, 1444, "REC"], [1459, 1505, "REC"], [1531, 1541, "REC"], [1543, 1567, "REC"], [1569, 1591, "REC"], [1593, 1609, "REC"], [1615, 1662, "REC"], [2005, 2048, "REC"], [2082, 2122, "REC"], [2126, 2182, "REC"], [3089, 3107, "REC"], [3125, 3172, "REC"], [3197, 3248, "REC"], [3254, 3297, "REC"], [3299, 3328, "REC"], [3445, 3497, "REC"], [3599, 3652, "REC"], [3692, 3745, "REC"], [4173, 4243, "REC"], [4675, 4731, "REC"], [3392, 3441, "REC"]], "Lesson ID": 664}

{"id": 16623, "data": "Finding: The procedures at Stennis Space Center (SSC) are designed to provide maximum flexibility and adaptability. Each procedure attempts to anticipate all possible situations which leads to very voluminous and complex procedures that are difficult to follow. Recommendation: Restructure and re-format the SSC procedures to reduce complexity, ambiguity and to enhance the probability of being understood by technicians and inspectors prior to performing the work. Consider individual planning for unique jobs with the aid of computers and include/adopt either the KSC or Canoga Park system or elements thereof. Finding: The initial release of a SSC procedure is formally controlled, however, subsequent modifications in the field are not, and the responsibility for establishing the options is unclear. The system relies on redlining and DNAing major sections by technicians, inspectors, engineering, and quality engineering to custom fit the procedure to the specific circumstances at hand. Technicians and inspectors routinely DNA and redline procedures. In some cases, the hardware is not subsequently under the control of the person selecting the DNA option. Recommendation: Procedures should be reviewed and approved by engineering for accuracy and revision as required for the identified task prior to release to the floor. Decisions affecting hardware configuration should be made by engineering in the course of the review; not left up to the floor technicians and inspectors. DNA/NA options to be exercised on the floor should be limited to those actions where results are immediately verifiable and obvious. DNA/NA options which require decisions where the results are not under the control of the affected line personnel should be disallowed, and if situation changes, new planning should be issued. A procedure deviation system for initiating deviations to correct errors/oversights would be helpful. Deviations should be reviewed prior to the use of a procedure. Redlines should be limited to minor pen and ink changes not affecting intent, e.g., typographical errors. Finding: Disciplined implementation of existing procedures was inadequate by floor technicians and quality assurance personnel. Technicians performed five procedural steps in the CCVA procedure (Rework #49) that, if properly accomplished, would have disclosed the missing hardware. The QA inspector stamped four of these five. Three other steps were performed in this procedure that would have possibly disclosed the deficiency. The procedure was clear in these areas and the careful accomplishment of these actions with all parties properly fulfilling their roles would have prevented this problem. Recommendation: Personnel performing operations must fully understand the importance of their tasks and consequences of incorrect action(s). They must understand the significance of their stamps on the planning whereby they certify and agree to the accomplishment/verification of the specific task(s). Technicians and inspectors should not stamp work they have not personally witnessed. Reinforcement of these responsibilities through additional training/orientation by supervision appears to be warranted to assure the proper level of discipline is in place. Finding: Performance in accordance with the current procedural system does not assure that the hardware configuration is under control through all phases of disassembly/reassembly. Recommendation: The procedural control of hardware configuration needs to be addressed and changes instituted to assure the hardware configuration is known and under control at all times. This should apply to the transfer of hardware status from one type of paper to another, to procedures controlling the hardware transfer, storage, issuance, and to the procedures for verifying configuration integrity. Finding: A major SSC planning document deficiency is the absence of a list of parts required to start the job and of parts to be left over after the job. Recommendation: Incorporate in planning a list of required parts and a list of parts to be left after the job. Finding: The existence and location of flight and test hardware on test stand A-1 appears to be uncontrolled. The uninstalled coupling was found on level 5. There was a line assembly on level 5 that belonged on level 8. On level 8, a shim was found that should have been left in building 3202. Recommendation: Institute a system that inventories and controls the location of test and flight hardware on all test stands. A preferred approach would be a centralized location rather than multiple locations. The parts crib should be a controlled access area with an individual responsible for inventory of incoming parts and issue to technicians. Parts should be segregated and identified in the crib in such a manner that they can be unambiguously located and retrieved for a particular job/engine. Finding: Flight engine 2032 was shipped from building 3202 to the A-1 test stand with a considerable amount of open work and a sizable box approximately 4 X 8 X 4 feet with loose parts. The exact configuration of the engine as shipped was not clearly defined and the absence of parts lists did not force reacting to an unaccounted left-over part like the coupling. Recommendation: Discontinue the practice of shipping flight engines with open work unless the work is related to high pressure pumps. Provide an inventory list of loose parts shipped with the engine and to be installed, and a list of parts to be removed from the engine and centrally collected prior to hot fire testing. Institute a system that reacts to parts left over and unaccounted for. If parts to be installed are shipped separately, they are to be identified on the inventory list not as being in the shipping box but as still to be delivered. A verification system should be in place at the engine position that provides assurance of hardware configuration. Finding: Technicians and inspectors interviewed did not know that the actuator which was to be installed was new and being installed for green run purposes. It appeared that the working people in general are not being briefed as to long term objectives. Recommendation: Establish an information system such that also technicians are aware of long term objectives and not just near term objectives of getting dates, paragraphs stamped off, and the paper closed. Finding: No clear identification of a responsible development engineer having full responsibility for the successful accomplishment of a given task. Recommendation: Assure the clear identification of a lead development engineer and full delineation of his responsibilities for each job. Finding: Integration of Government Agency and contractor procedures is inadequate as evidenced by the existence of conflicting instructions concerning mandatory inspection points. Recommendation: The Government Agency letter dated November 24, 1987, concerning a post activity closed paper review of DNA/NA operations having a Government Agency review within them should be rescinded.", "label": [[278, 322, "REC"], [326, 354, "REC"], [566, 591, "REC"], [475, 510, "REC"], [1181, 1223, "REC"], [1915, 1976, "REC"], [1978, 2004, "REC"], [2743, 2783, "REC"], [2788, 2823, "REC"], [2835, 2878, "REC"], [3020, 3069, "REC"], [3119, 3150, "REC"], [3538, 3598, "REC"], [4417, 4494, "REC"], [4547, 4567, "REC"]], "Lesson ID": 1340}

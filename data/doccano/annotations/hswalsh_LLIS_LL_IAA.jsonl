The IDC purge components were not designed to prevent overpressurization, which caused system failure. Instead of a Bepco enclosure pressure control valve, a Bepco control panel rapid-exchange valve was used to control GN2 system purge. This allowed the rapid release of overpressure, which in turn caused the system to fail. The IDC single-stage regulator was found to have vibrated open, causing the inlet pressure to increase (creep) to 50 psi. The nominal operational pressure setting is 10 psi. This increase in the inlet pressure setting allowed the system to become overpressurized and caused the system to fail. The IDC camera head enclosure lid was not sealed properly because of ground wire interference, which caused a differential in system pressure between enclosures. The bottom clip on the IDC camera battery, power supply, and power supply enclosure were seated but did not catch the enclosure door, which contributed to system purge leakage. NASA lab personnel completed measurement testing before the ICD was put into operational use. However, purge system operation and functional checkout were not performed, which prevented detection of system overpressurization before operational use. The current operational procedure, MDA Prototype Ice Detection Camera User Manual Rev 4.0, was not followed. Use of that operational procedure might have prevented the system overpressurization. A new local procedure for field use will be developed containing all operational steps, notes, cautions, and warnings. The procedure will include a section requiring that such equipment undergo purge and functional checkout in a NASA lab before use in the field. All operators will be trained on the use of the new procedure and the IDC.

Nonadherence to the implementation methods presented above could result in the following possible impacts: improper cleaning and processing of the aluminum container could result in contaminants reacting with the ammonia to form NCG, which will interfere with the flow of vapor and reduce the heat transfer effectiveness. Contaminants reacting with ammonia normally produce hydrogen, and the gas collects in the condenser region. As more and more of the condenser is blocked, the surface area available for heat rejection decreases, reducing the heat transfer effectiveness; ultimately, the heat pipe may cease to function.

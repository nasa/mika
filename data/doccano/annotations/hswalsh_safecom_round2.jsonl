{"id": 262, "data": "The xxx Creek Fire’s complexity is attracting interest from the various entities that have roles and responsibilities serving the public.  It's drawing additional interest from media and from the general public.  With the popularity and portability of UAS, drones are used by county law enforcement and fire districts.  The public launches them to gather footage, and the media routinely collects video for news coverage reporting current conditions.  There are many reasons to use drones.\r\nThe xxx Creek Fire, since the wind event, has been under very poor visibility which has grounded our manned aviation operation, however we have been collecting some intel from a fire controlled UAS.  A TFR has been over the fire steady with the exception of one afternoon where it was cancelled to facilitate an adjacent fire posting their new TFR.\r\nOnly one agency has asked permission to fly in our TFR on private lands to collect information to facilitate their mission.  Another similar agency has produced video footage and has expressed no interest in working with the fire aviation program to communicate or meet FAA rules.  I am finding many do not fully comprehend the complexity of a fire aviation program, airspace coordination and the communication with players such, as ATGS who direct operations and set priorities.  This lack of understanding can place our pilots, and manned and unmanned aircraft at risk.  Results could be catastrophic or shut our air operations down. \r\n As the UAS program continues grows, sanctioned and unsanctioned, UAS coordinators need to be more available to advise, coach valid users through the FAA approvals, and recommend how best to coordinate UAS airspace.  \r\nOn a complex fire, traditional air operation managers still have the load of the traditional aviation program and now this additional burden.  A lack of experience and understanding of UAS authorizations and operations makes it easy to say “no” rather than allowing the system to work and helping the UAS users to understand priorities, and learning how we can work together under tightly regulated access.\r\nRASM: This event is likely a reflection of similar events going on within this region and nationally.

In order to integrate UAS into a Fire Traffic Area within a Temporary Flight Restriction with other manned aviation, we must be able to communicate, coordinate and deconflict the airspace with the appropriate levels of authorization.  Without it, the results could lead to aviation mishaps or accidents.   UAS policy must align with our federal agencies and our cooperators, be understood and known to all UAS entities requesting to offer up assistance.  The utilization of an on-demand regional UAS coordinator will help to manage incoming request from our cooperators and disseminate timely information to the AOBD’s in order to coordinate and deconflict airspace.

On July 17, 2015 I contacted the FAA in Reno {Jim Richardson} and filed a report.  The FAA investigator took my statement contact information and will be receiving a narrative report via email. In addition Julie Stewart the USFS/BLM National Airspace Coordinator was notified and the encounter will be documented on the master list she is keeping.", "label": [[457, 485, "CAU"], [744, 759, "CON"], [1145, 1181, "CON"], [1472, 1486, "CON"], [984, 1012, "MOD"], [1572, 1588, "CON"], [1630, 1681, "CON"], [1690, 1718, "CON"]], "Tracking #": "15-0453", "Mission Type": "Fire, Helitack"}
{"id": 268, "data": "At run-up for a ISR mission for the Eldorado Fire, pilots noticed degraded rpm performance. A quick troubleshooting with new spark plugs, air filter and fuel filter did not fix the problem. \r\nIt was decided that we would replace the engine with the spare, as the low rpm engine was near the end of its life. After installing the new engine it would not start.  After troubleshooting it was found that the new engine had an incomplete wiring harness that was missing the appropriate terminal pins that activated the fuel injection system.   This was a manufacturer error.  BridgerAerospace flew in a new engine and installed on the evening of 9/20. A test flight was completed on 9/21. Aircraft is in service.\r\n\r\nThe low rpm engine was driven to be rebuilt in Oregon. It will be driven or flown to us most likely 9/22 or 9/23.\r\n\r\nThe incomplete wiring harness engine was flown to Tucson for a corrected repair. Estimated that we will have the engine on site as a spare on 9/22. \r\n\r\nKudos to Bridger Aerospace for using good risk management in a degraded rpm situation. Additionally it was impressive to have the aircraft back in service so quickly. They were able to work around a manufacturing defect and provide quick solutions to a difficult problem.", "label": [[66, 90, "MOD"], [221, 239, "CON"], [121, 164, "CON"], [100, 115, "CON"], [249, 254, "CON"], [282, 306, "CAU"], [367, 382, "CON"], [314, 339, "CON"], [423, 448, "CAU"], [458, 495, "CAU"], [551, 569, "CAU"], [589, 609, "CON"], [614, 623, "CON"], [650, 661, "CON"], [716, 755, "CON"], [778, 799, "CON"], [870, 885, "CON"], [833, 858, "CAU"], [1018, 1038, "CON"], [1044, 1056, "MOD"], [1180, 1200, "CAU"], [1166, 1177, "CON"], [1205, 1228, "CON"]], "Tracking #": "20-1197", "Mission Type": "Fire, Infrared Imagery"}

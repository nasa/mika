Ensure that all critical voltage regions are properly vented. Use insulation materials of high dielectric strength. Insulating materials with strength greater than 300 volts/mil and a relative dielectric constant less than 5 are preferred. For high voltages, use only connectors that have been tested to work in the critical pressure region. Also, use only soldering terminals rated for high voltage.

{"id": 270, "data": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Guideline Number GT-TE-2404 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: The Fizeau interferometer is used to measure the quality of optical components and systems. It provides a guide for the manufacturing of components, an aid for alignment, and a validation of system performance. Implementation Method: Description of Fizeau Interferometer The basic layout of a Fizeau interferometer is shown in Figure 1 (Reference 1.). A laser source is spatially filtered via a microscope objective and a pinhole. This pinhole is located at the focal point of a collimating lens. Between the pinhole and lens is a beam-splitter. The collimated beam encounters a slightly wedged glass plate. This is the heart of the interferometer. The surface adjacent to the collimating lens is of good optical quality. However, the next surface is of exceptional optical quality, l/20 peak to valley (PV) or better. This is the reference surface and part of the collimated beam is reflected by this surface. Part of the collimated beam continues on to interrogate the optic being tested. The return beam contains information on aberration introduced by the test optic. The two wavefronts recombine inside the interferometer. The beam-splitter diverts the combined beams toward a recording medium, either film or a TV (CCD or vidicon). An intermediate lens together with the collimating lens forms an image of the test surface onto the recording plane. An observer will see a sharp image of the test surface with an interference (or fringe) pattern running through it. [D] Application of Fizeau Interferometer 1. Testing a Flat Suppose the test object is a plane glass surface whose quality (flatness) we wish to inspect. We must first align the test surface to the interferometer. Most commercial Fizeau interferometers have an quotalign mode.quot This requires the user to center a bright dot (the reflected return) on a crosshair on some viewing screen. Suppose the test surface has a depression in it as illustrated in Figure 2. The flat wavefront from the interferometer is incident on the test surface and reflected back into the interferometer. Note that the reflected portion shown in Figure 2 has picked up twice the surface error inherent in the test surface. This aberrated wavefront returns through the reference plate to combine with the reflected reference. [D] Wherever two coherent wavefronts overlap they interfere with each other. The equation describing interference (Reference 2) is as follows: [D] To obtain good high contrast fringes requires that the reflection off the reference and off the test piece must be equivalent in intensity. Maximum fringe contrast occurs when I1 = I2 . For example, a bare glass test surface reflects 4%. To maximize fringe contrast the reference surface must also reflect 4%. If a 4% reference surface is used to test a mirror (with 90% plus reflectivity), then a very thin beam-splitter (e.g., a pellicle) can be used to reduce the intensity from the test optic. Alternatively, a reference surface having a much higher reflectivity can be used to improve fringe contrast. In the latter case, one will notice that the dark fringes become much thinner, like sharp pencil lines. A sample interferogram of a supposed quotflatquot mirror is shown in Figure 3. If the mirror were flat, equally spaced straight line fringes should be observed (depending on the relative tilt between the reference surface and the test surface). Obviously, the mirror is not very flat at all. Each fringe is a height contour as in a topographical map. (The metric or unit of measure in most Fizeau interferometers is the wavelength of the source. For example, the helium near laser wavelength is 0.6328 microns.) The height difference between each contour or fringe is 1 wave. If knowledge of the surface error or its departure from flatness is desired, we must interpret these fringes as representing half-wave contours! [D] In addition we must know whether the pattern seen in Figure 3 is a hill or a valley on the mirror surface. This can be determined by placing your finger on the front of the reference surface metal support ring (Figure 1) and pressing lightly toward the interferometer housing. If the fringe patterns collapse or contract, the pattern represents a hill or bump. If they expand, the pattern represents a valley. 2. Testing a Lens The setup for testing a lens is illustrated in Figure 4. The lens is carefully aligned to the Fizeau beam. The beam is focused by the lens to an image point. To return the beam back to the interferometer another auxiliary reference surface is needed. In this example a small concave spherical mirror is used. This sphere should be mounted so that X,Y, and Z translation degrees of freedom are available. The center of curvature of the sphere is then made coincident with the focal point of the lens. (Be careful–make sure that the focussed beam is not on the surface of the small retro sphere). The beam is reflected by the reference sphere and returned through the system. [D] The interferogram that is initially seen is likely to be an off-center bull's eye pattern. This means that the reference sphere's center of curvature is not axially coincident with the lens focal point. Use the tip and tilt adjustments on the Fizeau reference surface to center the bull's eye as shown in Figure 5(a), then use the axial translation on the concave sphere to move the interferogram into a best null condition (i.e., minimizing the number of fringes seen over the interferogram), Figure 5(b). Now use the adjustments on the reference flat to introduce tilt fringes as shown in Figure 5(c). It should be noted that the test system has significant spherical aberration. [D] An alternate setup for testing a lens is shown in Figure 6. Here the Fizeau reference surface is a sphere. It is a specially designed positive power lens where rays emerging from the last surface of the lens are normal to that surface. The test lens is aligned to the test beam and oriented so its rear focal point is coincident with the transmission spheres focal point. The beam emerges from the lens as collimated light. A flat auxiliary referencesurface is needed to retro-reflect the test beam back to the interferometer. [D] We note that transmission spheres come in a variety of F-numbers. Since your test lens has a certain F-number, pick a transmission sphere whose F-number provides a beam that either fills or overfills the test lens. Never pick a transmission sphere that underfills because then you are not testing the lens over its full aperture. Aberration content will appear lower than it actually is. Configurations for testing a wide variety of other systems are illustrated in Figure 7. [D] 3. Retrace Error The purpose of the reference sphere in Figure 4 is to return the incoming ray back upon itself so that it follows the same path on the second pass as it did on the first pass. This occurs exactly only when the incoming beam happens to be perfect, i.e. exhibits a spherical wavefront. As aberration accumulates on the first pass through the test system, the match to the reference sphere becomes less perfect. Path deviations appear on the return ray, which is now no longer coincident with the first pass ray. The optical path difference picked up by the second pass ray is not the same as the first pass ray. This is retrace error (also called ray-mapping error) (References 1, 3 and 4). As a consequence, it is no longer true that we can simply divide the results by two to obtain the single pass wavefront aberration from double pass fringe data. There are some visual clues to indicate if retrace error is significant. First, with the room darkened, check to see that the beam diameter of the light returning through the test optic on the second-pass is the same as that for the first pass after setting the null-fringe. Second, examine the irradiance distribution of this second-pass beam at the test optic. If the second-pass beam overfills or underfills the test optic aperture, and/or the intensity distribution is nonuniform, then retrace error is significant in the test setup. To minimize the effect of retrace error, a different retro optic is usually needed. If retrace error were significant in the case illustrated in Figure 4, then a longer radius of curvature retro sphere is needed and it should be convex instead of concave. This is shown in Figure 8. The longer radius convex surface reduces the angular disparity between the incident and reflected rays. It also reduces the lateral offset between the first and second pass rays at surfaces in the test optic. [D] 4. Collecting and Handling Data It is not the purpose of this guideline to describe methods used to analyze interferograms. That deserves a guideline of its own. However, we will describe the various data collection schemes and how they interface with the analysis software. There are basically three options available to the user: 1) digitizing tablet, 2) automatic fringe following; 3) uniform grid phase measuring. The simplest and least expensive means of selecting and inputting data to an analysis code is via a digitizing tablet. A hard copy of the interferogram is placed on the tablet. The user interfaces with the tablet (and the fringe analysis code) with a digitizing pen or mouse. The code first asks the user to define the pupil. Next, data points for each fringe are entered in proper sequence from low to high contour. Once this data file is entered into the computer, the fringe code can proceed with its analysis and determine aberration content. To avoid the toil of hand digitizing, software packages are commercially available that incorporate a fringe following routine. The interferogram is imaged onto a CCD. A frame-grabber captures the fringe pattern and formats it for the computer. This intensity digitized image is then operated on by the fringe following software. It automatically generates data centered along a fringe. However, the user still must define the fringe order. An alternative approach to fringe following is a phase measuring interferometer (PMI). This is a highly automated data acquisition system. The reference plate of the Fizeau is mounted in a fixture which is piezoelectrically driven, i.e. minute cyclic axial shifts are introduced. (This is equivalent to introducing a piston into the fringe pattern.) The pupil image (with fringes across it) is recorded on a CCD. The CCD is a uniform array of sensors. Each pixel monitors the variation in local irradiance as the reference plate is moved by the actuators. Data is acquired at every pixel for four or five discrete positions of the reference plate during its sweep. This enormous amount of data is fed into a computer where the analysis software calculates the local phase at each pixel. Fringe ordering is done automatically. Plus, the huge amount of data collected on a uniform grid offers a dramatic improvement in accuracy and repeatability. Also note that this method allows the user to analyze the quotnullquot interference pattern, something the first two techniques cannot do. For a particular test setup it is usually a good idea to take four separate interferograms with fringes tilt-biased top, bottom, right, and left respectively. Fringe codes usually have an option whereby several interferograms can be averaged. An interferogram from each fringe bias is entered into the code, and the ensemble average obtained. This average is a better estimate of aberration content than any single interferogram. When testing imaging systems it is a good practice to repeat the test setup at least three times. This is because misalignments in the setup can introduce unwanted aberrations (usually coma). For each setup obtain the four fringe biased data sets mentioned above and calculate the subaverage. Then average these subaverages. 5. Environmental Constraints Vibration, whether induced through the floor into the air-isolated optical table supporting the interferometer or coupled via acoustics, is a major weakness of interferometers. This mechanical noise makes the fringe pattern unstable; it dances around at high frequency. It is hard to do meaningful interferometry under such shaky circumstances. Hence it is very important when establishing a metrology lab to locate it in a quiet area. For example, you would not want to place it between a machine shop and an optical fabrication shop. At times it may even be necessary to come in at night, when everyone else is gone and all other machines are turned off, just to get stable fringes. Another source of trouble is air currents or turbulence from air vents, or thermals (from electronic equipment for example). The fringes don't dance as with mechanical vibration but actually change shape. They meander! When an interferogram is obtained under these circumstances you are not sure how much is the test piece and how much due to changes in the refractive index in the intervening air. Shrouding the work area can be a considerable help. For example, commercial foam board from office supply houses is a useful shrouding material. Also, with a PMI, frame averaging can sometimes reduce the problem considerably. 6. Mounting Sometimes an aberration attributed to a test optic is actually induced by the manner in which the optic is held in a mount. People are sometimes afraid that an optic might fall out, so they clamp it in (or down) good and tight. As a result, the interferogram may show significant aberration (usually astigmatism) even though the optic itself is of excellent quality. So be careful, you want to constrain the test optic with a minimum of force–snug enough so that it doesn't rattle around–but loose enough to avoid stress-induced deformation. Large optics (meter class) have an additional mounting difficulty. They are usually quite heavy and can deform under their own weight (Reference 5). The fringe pattern will show significant astigmatism. Astronomical primary mirrors are particularly susceptible to this. Elaborate fixturing is sometimes required to alleviate the problem. Technical Rationale: All optics to be used on spaceborne or space-related instruments should be tested to validate their performance as required by specification. The Fizeau interferometer is the primary tool in this optical validation process. It provides the standard against which other optics are compared. Therefore proper use of a Fizeau interferometer ensures that the resulting data can be employed as a pass/fail criteria on the component or system. References J.

{"id": 271, "data": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice Number PD-AP-1312, from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. The use of the team approach to fault-tree analysis permits a rapid, intensive, and thorough investigation of space hardware and software anomalies. This approach is specifically applicable when the solution of engineering problems is urgent and when they must be resolved expeditiously to prevent further delays in program schedules. The systematic, focused, highly participative methodology permits quick and accurate identification, recording, and solution of problems. The resulting benefits of the use of this methodology are reduction of analysis time, and precision in identifying and correcting deficiencies. The ultimate result is improved overall system reliability and safety. Implementation Method: Determination that a Team Approach to Fault-Tree Analysis is Required: In situations where program hardware or software anomalies are uncovered which could potentially reduce the possibility of mission success or cause harm to personnel, and where the pressure of schedules requires a rapid and accurate solution of problems, the team approach to fault-tree analysis should be strongly considered. Fault-trees are necessary when the system in question is complex and has many potential contributors to the problem so that the solution defies simple intuition, engineering judgement, or easy elimination of the events that contributed to the problem. The team approach to fault-tree analysis brings all disciplines to bear simultaneously in an interactive but controlled environment. A fault-tree is defined as, quota graphic depiction or model of the rationally conceivable sequences of events within a complex system that could lead ultimately to the observed failure or potential failure.quot It is a systematic approach to fault prevention achieved by postulating potential high level faults, and identifying the primary and secondary causes, down to the lowest piece-part, that could induce the high level fault. A typical arrangement of a fault-tree showing the potential types of quotgatesquot containing Boolean logic is shown on Figure 1. In situations of high urgency and cost or schedule sensitivity, it is often desirable to apply a team approach to development and use of the fault-tree methodology. [D] Fault-Tree Team Methodology: The keys to a successful team approach to a fault-tree analysis are: (1) selection of the right people to participate in the analysis; (2) interactive meetings of these people in a creative but focused environment; (3) thorough documentation of objectives, fault-tree structure, and action items; (4) parallel (but not redundant) participation by all team members; and (5) careful attention to general ground rules for effective team dynamics. All of the preceding must be backed up by a data base containing the hardware/software configuration, operational time lines, potential failure causes, and exonerating or indicting data. Logic flow networks are built based on the system's design, then laboratory test results, hardware/software test results, and modeling based on deterministic and/or probabilistic statistical analyses. These logic flow networks also feed into the information data base that is used by the fault-tree team. An integral part of successful fault-tree methodology is the selection of an orderly structure on which to base the fault-tree and the team participation. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is an ideal starting point for the team as well as for the design. Each event or activity in the WBS is subdivided into its main contributing events or activities, then the tree is subdivided again until the smallest activity that cannot be further subdivided is reached. These final events or activities are the quotleavesquot on the fault-tree. Team Composition: Given the nature of the failure or anomaly being investigated, people should be assembled who have both an intimate disciplinary knowledge and a knowledge of the overall system. Elements heads and subteam leaders should be established for major investigative elements of the work breakdown structure. Important administrative functions to support the team are: (1) the maintenance of a current address, phone, and fax listing of all persons involved; (2) recording daily team meeting minutes; (3) preparation of agenda for the next day, (prepared at the end of the current day); (4) recording of all action items including the name of the person responsible, suspense dates, and the specific action required; and (5) the maintenance of a master schedule of major planned events, based in part on the suspense dates. Team Dynamics and Work Strategy: The entire team should meet together in one location in a meeting to expose all known data related to the anomaly or failure, then the team should meet at least once per day thereafter. Action items should be assigned and as much work as possible should be done in parallel without undue redundancy. Series activities of the team should be avoided. Team interaction is important because the fault-tree is built in a dynamic, contributory fashion. During the fault-tree team activities, the team leader and scribe should keep files of action items, agendas, technical data related to development of the fault-tree, correspondence, administrative reports, the master fault-tree diagram, and the team's schedule. Top management and other related organizations should be kept informed as to the progress of the team. Hand written notes to the key players from the team leader quoten route,quot at key milestones and critical junctures, and on successful completion of the investigation are particularly helpful. Rambling discourses should be avoided. Meetings and discussions must be diplomatically kept on track. The leader should be as democratic as possible in team meetings. No one should be affronted, but in case of an impasse, the team leader must make the decision. Refreshments should be provided occasionally, especially on Saturday or Sunday and after hours. This will boost morale and provide an atmosphere conducive to free discussion. Other General Techniques and Methods: The purpose of the team approach is to provide multidisciplinary perspectives that will uncover details and to resolve cause/effect relationships which may not be apparent in more narrowly focused detailed engineering analytical and design methods. Therefore, each element of the fault-tree must be doggedly and systematically analyzed, persistently subdivided into it's smallest elements, and pursued to the lowest level. The history of these types of investigations has indicated that a methodical, vigorous assessment is needed to develop and to utilize a fault-tree of sufficient depth. This vigorous assessment will eliminate illogical assumption, identify or eliminate synergistic effects, help to avoid partial fixes and reduce intuitive or random approaches that cannot be substantiated. The team should resist the temptation to preconceive a conclusion or take on a quotpet theoryquot to the exclusion of a systematic, orderly, and vigorous treatment of all elements in the decision tree. The team should avoid any tendency to slow down the analysis process or to assume that a conclusion has been reached when a likely cause candidate has been identified, because this potential candidate could mask the true cause or divert the team's attention from a more fruitful path. Probability and statistics are important disciplines to use in the fault-tree analysis process. The team should have an appreciation of the fact that if it is necessary to stack too many possible events together to eventually postulate the occurrence of the failure, then it is improbable that it occurred in that manner. The references list several computer-aided fault-tree analysis software packages that will aid in performing the statistical analysis and informing the decision tree graphics required to document a fault-tree analysis. Technical Rationale: The team approach to fault-tree analysis described in this practice was used very successfully in a number of in-depth investigations of problems that occurred in propulsion elements of the Space Shuttle, and related facilities and equipment. The procedure was first used in full measure in the investigation of a fire in the casting pit of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) in 1984. It was also used in identifying causes of problems in the SRM propellant mix facility. Several problems and potential problems with the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) were successfully investigated using the team approach to fault-tree analysis. These investigations involved the bearings for the alternate turbopump, and a synchronous vibration problem. Hydrogen leaks in the Space Shuttle Columbia were investigated and successfully resolved in an in-depth and intensive three-month team approach to fault-tree analysis.

In addition a nearby enclosure was insufficiently vented for boost pressure decay. As the spacecraft passed the critical pressure region, a corona discharge occurred, disabling the camera system. The result was a complete loss of imaging data. 1971- Mariner Mars (ground): During acceptance testing, it was found that a lack of RF breakdown margin at critical pressure necessitated costly design changes. 1971- Mariner Mars (in-flight): Unexpected battery venting caused a brief critical pressure region around the high voltage Canopus star tracker, resulting in a corona discharge. The arc caused a ground-loop current spike that resulted in the permanent loss of 22 telemetry channels in the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). 1976- Viking 2 (in-flight): The Viking Lander's downlink failed while on the surface of Mars. This suggested that the high voltage power converter developed a corona discharge and high voltage breakdown while in the critical CO2 pressure region present near the surface of Mars.

This produced a critical pressure region, corona discharge, and failure of the EUV high voltage power supply. 1989- NSCAT (ground): Windings added to a traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) transformer for test purposes, resulted in increased voltage in the primary windings, which triggered a corona discharge. 1989- Magellan (in-flight): The pyrotechnic firing which separated the solid rocket motor, used for Venus Orbit Insertion, resulted in a plasma arc, a ground current loop, and destruction of a significant amount of spacecraft memory. 1990- Mars Observer (ground): Due to inadequate insulation of the TWTA, a corona discharge occurred at critical pressure during evacuation of the vacuum chamber.

{"id": 280, "data": "(Relevant Historical Lesson(s) Learned) A deficiency was discovered during circuit design verification which might not have shown up during testing. The condition involved capacitors having a large AC voltage between the capacitor body and its surroundings, and the capacitors having air pockets or voids between the body and the outside jacket. The finding is significant because this condition can remain harmless at atmospheric pressure, yet lead to corona and possible failure after months or years in the vacuum of space. To solve an interaction problem between the Voyager Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) and the power supply, the designer added a voltage doubler circuit having capacitors as integral parts of the circuit. The standard high-voltage capacitors initially used have the outside of the body taped to provide a moisture barrier. The doubler operates at 7.2 kHz with an input higher than 300 volts AC. The action of a voltage doubler is such that the two plates of the capacitors used change potential each time the inverter switches. The transformer winding that drives the doubler capacitors is referenced to the TWT collector through a diode bridge. Each winding output is, therefore, near collector voltage on one half cycle and changes by the transformer winding's output voltage (about 700 V) on the next half cycle. When the combined problem of the high AC voltage and the trapped air pockets was realized, the designers specified that modified capacitors, not having the tape wrapping, be procured. These were then specially prepared by vacuum coating with Scotchcast 281.", "label": [[172, 208, "CAU"], [266, 304, "CAU"], [453, 459, "MOD"], [631, 671, "CON"]], "Lesson ID": 417}

{"id": 282, "data": "During integration of the Genesis spacecraft, many flight and ground support equipment (GSE) cables were found to be electrically incompatible with spacecraft systems although they matched the cable wiring diagrams. Several times, testing had to be halted and the system analyzed for possible electrical overstress caused by power having been applied to the wrong pins. Eventually, spacecraft testing was stopped long enough to perform a pin-by-pin comparison of the cable wiring diagrams to the latest unit and system schematics. Once this was completed, errors were identified, the cables were reworked, and the problems were resolved. The accuracy of cable wiring diagrams was a continuing problem on Genesis. Typically, cables are built by cable harness shops to the specifications provided by cable drawings and cable wiring diagrams. Cable design and fabrication may take place concurrently with the design of spacecraft black boxes. As a system design evolves and pin-out requirements change, there is a time lag before the interface control drawing (ICD) is updated and the changes flow back to the cable design and documentation. Should the cables be built to an outdated document, the first powering of a given spacecraft may cause major damage. Since the connectors still mate with their assigned receptacles, the electrical mismatches may not be apparent. Validating the cable harness configuration against unit and system schematics is a very time-consuming activity. If it is delayed until integration and test has already commenced, the task can impact the project schedule.

{"id": 285, "data": "Shortly after separation of the Wide-Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) spacecraft from the launch vehicle, venting of the secondary cryogen tank was commanded, as planned, to dissipate the heat absorbed by the cryogen since termination of ground cooling. Venting this small amount of hydrogen gas was expected to induce some tumbling of the spacecraft. This tumbling was also expected to be quickly dampened by the attitude control system as the solid hydrogen reached equilibrium with the low space-ambient temperature. Instead, the spacecraft was observed to be tumbling too fast to be countered by the reaction wheels and magnetic torquers--an out-of-control condition. A NASA review board determined (reference 1) that an error in the design of the pyro electronics caused premature release of the telescope cover when the secondary cryogen tank was vented. The cover release permitted a large heat load into the cryostat that caused greater and more prolonged cryogen venting then expected following the transient associated with secondary vent actuation. A \"T\" fitting had been placed at the vent outlet to balance the thrust induced to the spacecraft by the gas flow expected from the planned venting sequence. However, design analysis did not consider the torque effects of worst case transient flows caused by one side of the \"T\" pointing directly at a connector (added as a late design modification during integration). The combined applied torque to the spacecraft from the initial secondary vent transient and the effects of early cover release was greater than the attitude control system capability. An independent analysis performed by a member of the WIRE JPL Review Board (reference 1, appendix E, p. 91) indicated the possibility that the normal secondary vent actuation transient could have exceeded attitude control capability. This could significantly impact early science return since it would take many days to reestablish a stable spacecraft attitude. Venting analyses performed during the design phase considered only the steady state cryogen flows expected during primary mission science pointing. However, the premature release of the instrument cover, and resultant boil-off of the cryogen required for telescope operation, was determined by the review board to be the direct cause of the WIRE mission loss (references 1 and 2). It was also determined that the design characteristics of the cryogen tank vent outlet prevented timely control of spacecraft attitude following the cover release anomaly, and the venting-induced torque deterred any productive efforts to save the mission.

These velocity increments and accelerations were traced to the unbalanced translational accelerations produced by the attitude control system, its response to torques induced by solar pressure, and to the impingement of gas from the pitch thrusters onto other parts of the spacecraft structure. The magnitude of these dynamic effects required that they be modelled in the orbit determination process throughout the flight. This involved additional orbit determination processing and analysis, and necessitated a new operational interface between the Spacecraft Team and Navigation Team. A special in-flight impingement test was performed to provide data for modelling.

{"id": 422, "data": "Two satellites with different propulsion system designs were lost in 1993 and 1994. Limited telemetry was received on the incidents. Subsequent failure investigation focused on possible propulsion feed system design flaws. In both cases, pyrovalves were used to isolate the hydrazine supply until the satellite was separated from the launch vehicle. [D] In accordance with a common design practice for engine feed systems, two pyrovalves were placed in parallel to provide redundancy. With the hydrazine tank isolated, pressurized fuel was present upstream of the pyrovalves (e.g., Point A), but only a dry nitrogen quotpad gasquot at low pressure downstream of the pyrovalves (e.g., Point B). On one spacecraft it was unclear what the gas composition was and whether it was totally vented through the thruster prior to the priming event. During priming of the hydrazine system, the primary pyrovalve was fired to charge propellant lines leading to the engine. When the propellant reached the thruster valves and stopped, it produced a pressure surge. Under certain conditions, this surge could cause exothermic decomposition of the fuel, and tests were conducted to assess if the prevalent conditions were conducive to exothermic decomposition. This particular failure mode was never observed during the failure investigations. However, when the backup pyrovalve was fired a second later during one test, the blow-by of hot gas into the lines between Points A and B detonated the decomposed fuel; this then breached the fuel lines on both sides of the backup pyrovalve. The tests did not exhibit this detonation failure mode when, just prior to firing the backup pyrovalve, the pad gas was evacuated to leave a vacuum downstream of both pyrovalves.

{"Recommendation(s)":"We define K2 performance metrics for data compression and pixel budget available in each campaign; the photometric noise on exoplanet transit and stellar activity timescales; residual correlations in corrected long-cadence light curves; and the protection of test sinusoidal signals from overfitting in the systematic error removal process. We find that data compression and noise both increase linearly with radial distance from the center of the field of view, with the data compression proportional to star count as well. At the center, where roll motion is nearly negligible, the limited 6 hr photometric precision for a quiet 12th magnitude star cam be as low as 30 ppm, only 25% higher than that of Kepler. This noise performance is achieved without sacrificing signal fidelity; test sinusoids injected into the data are attenuated by less than 10% for signals with periods up to 15 days, so that a wide range of stellar rotation and variability signatures are preserved by the K2 pipeline.","Lesson ID":28903}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A visual tool such as a matrix\/chart or end-to-end line diagram (ref Figure 1 and Figure 2) was found to be helpful in completing this assessment. An example matrix can be seen in Table 1, which shows the LRS PLC assignments (second row) for each end item signal (left column) as well as the KGCS comm rack\/gateway assignment for the PLC\u2019s (top row). It can easily be seen from such a layout that end items 1 through 3 have redundant LRS PLC\u2019s, but both of the PLC\u2019s would be lost if the 34612 comm rack or Gateway 1 were lost; therefore, visibility\/control of end items 1 through 3 would also be lost.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Note that there are multiple candidate design measures for ensuring propellant vapors never meet, including: A propulsion subsystem design that uses separate pressurant tanks, similar to the Europa Clipper design. Use of check valves that prevent vapor back-flow. For example, such check calves were used successfully by the Cassini project, which employed a combination of latch valves and pyro valves like Juno, but the Cassini valves were no longer available for acquisition by the Juno project. Incorporate pyro valves in both propellant sides and reduce the time the tanks are not isolated. In designing spacecraft propulsion subsystems for long-duration missions: Adhere to JPL\u2019s test-as-you-fly (TAYF) principle when flight-qualifying check valves. (That is, life testing would likely have detected the Juno oxidizer leak that led to either FORP build-up or excessive exposure of the check valve to oxidizer.) This recommendation may be very difficult to implement because it requires full mission-duration, high-fidelity testing lasting years. If TAYF is not feasible for a project, the propulsion subsystem should ensure positive isolation of the propellant vapors throughout the mission. This is in contrast to the current practice of seeking to limit the propellant vapor contact to benign concentrations, partly by means of pyrolitic isolation valves. Projects should continue to incorporate sufficient downlink telemetry to ascertain the health and functionality of the propulsion subsystem.","Lesson ID":28105}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Include analysis teams in approval process of drawings. If a project chooses to forego approval by analysts, an alternate review point should be established to aid in communication and tracking of the design configuration through a components\u2019 lifecycle.","Lesson ID":28202}
{"Recommendation(s)":"If a Weld Procedure Specification (WPS) is developed and qualified early in the product\u2019s life cycle, a design review (such as a Manufacturing Readiness Review), should include an assessment of any departures between the weld qualification test samples and the flight design.","Lesson ID":28201}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Account for the effects of gravitational variations Account for the effects of gravitational variations caused by latitude, altitude, and local topography in the design of the EDL system for terminal descent and touchdown. In particular, follow the recommendations of Reference (4), including: Engage the scientific community\u2019s gravity modeling experts in order to get the highest fidelity gravity models available, that include surface effects. Based on the models from subparagraph A, improve the onboard gravity model by adding a site-specific gravity bias parameter to the flight software based on terrain-implied landing site gravity, for use when the vehicle nears the surface. Incorporate the effects of the high-fidelity gravity model from subparagraph A on the truth gravity model for V&V of end-to-end system performance using the final landing site. Design for robustness to gravity knowledge errors Strive to design systems that measure directly the variables that are critical for the performance of that system. If, as is the case for a SkyCrane lander, there is a very challenging 3-axis ground-relative touchdown velocity requirement, the team should attempt to design a system that measures directly 3-axis ground-relative velocity measurements all the way until touchdown. The factors that might make that principle difficult to achieve, such as sensor minimum range, RF-interference, sensor Fields-of-View (FOVs), rocket engine plumes and the dust generated when they interact with the surface, should be addressed early in the project when the sensor is being specified and accommodated in the lander. Seek and use the highest fidelity gravity model available for your application Seek and use the highest fidelity gravity model for your application, in particular for those applications where having a very accurate gravity model all the way to the surface of the body is critical for achieving the required system performance. Use those models during the design phase of the mission to develop the proper reduced-order on-board gravity model and during the V&V phase in the truth model to certify the end-to-end system performance for the candidate and final landing sites. Be aware that in order to capture gravity effects near the surface with the required fidelity, gravity models based on spherical harmonic expansions might have to be of a very high order at best, or might be totally inadequate at worst. This might be the case, for example, for gravity models for applications that need to include the effects of mass concentrations (mascons) on the Moon, or the effects of large topographical features such as Gale Crater on Mars, or for gravity models for small bodies with complex shapes like comets and asteroids. In seeking the highest fidelity models for your application, be aware that you might have to go outside the EDL\/De-orbit, Descent, and Landing (DDL)\/GN&C community to find them. (For MSL, after all, the only model with the proper fidelity to capture fully the Gale Crater gravity anomaly was the one developed by Curtin University's Western Australian Centre for Geodesy). Maintain adequate margins between subsystems Strive to maintain system margin between subsystems all the way until landing day, in particular when the project is attempting a new function or a significant jump in performance relative to previous missions.","Lesson ID":27901}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Switching voltage transients caused by leakage inductance should be characterized through simulation and test, and protective circuity (e.g., snubbers, clamps) employed where needed. For circuit devices that are susceptible to SEE and are intended to be operated in a radiation environment over the course of a mission, ensure that the devices are protected from even transitory over-voltage conditions that could trigger SEB or SEGR.","Lesson ID":27701}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A number of simple enhancements can be made to improve this design. The preferred method would be to qualify the data signal. This is possible if the source of the signal is coming from a circuit that can also produce a qualifying data strobe indicating that the data is valid. For example, if the signals come from a microcontroller (as was the case with the system that misfired) two output ports could be used in the configuration as shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2: Improved Latching Circuit This circuit has the advantage that the F\/F will only be set when DATA is coincident with the positive edge of the STROBE; at other times the F\/F will be immune to noise. In pyro control systems that use a 2-phase ARM and FIRE control approach, the ARM control can potentially be used on the DATA input and the FIRE control can be used to latch the DATA on the strobe input. When a DATA\/STROBE configuration is not possible other techniques can be used to improve noise immunity. A simple RC low pass filter shown in Fig. 3 can be added to the clock line in Fig. 1. This will attenuate noise above the cutoff frequency (fc) where fc=1\/ (2\u03c0RC). A word of caution with this approach, some F\/Fs will not operate properly if the clock edge transitions too slowly. One should use a F\/F (i.e. 74LVC1G74) with a Schmitt trigger on the clock input that can tolerate a slow clock rise time, or the design should include an external Schmitt trigger. Figure 3: Low-Pass Filter Alternately, a Debouncer (i.e. LCT6994) shown in Fig. 4 can be used as a low-pass filter. A delay value can be set with an external resistor network as shown. Figure 4: Debouncer In this configuration, the input signal must be stable for 100ms before the output changes; short pulses are ignored (filtered). For this to be effective the debouncer and F\/F of Fig.1 should be located near each other to minimize the signal path. It is also possible to apply a combination of techniques to ensure correct data latching. Lastly, confirming the design noise margin, either by test or via analysis when test is impractical, to inadvertent firing is important in a system where an inadvertent fire is catastrophic. This margin should be on critical control inputs in thresholding logic ahead of the fire control inhibit semiconductor switches. Per specifications that date back to MIL-STD-1576, the noise floor during tests should not reach \u00bd the threshold voltage (6 dB) required to activate the devices.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Generally, it would be more appropriate to perform static load tests on the individual wire rope isolators and only perform the sine burst testing on the electronics box in a rigid configuration. However, if individual circumstances warrant the use of sine burst testing with wire rope isolators, the following recommendations should be considered. If possible, sine burst testing should be performed at the EDU level [NASA-STD-7008, NESC-TB-15-02].* If sine burst testing must be performed on a flight unit, either perform additional testing to fully understand the nonlinearities or remove the source of the nonlinearities from the test.** Ensure that test-related hardware such as instrumentation and contamination control bags are configured so that they will not interfere with the dynamic response of the test article during the sine burst test. *In this example, IAM EDU testing was performed, but the EDU did not adequately represent the flight unit for several reasons, including the fact that wire rope isolators were not included. **In this example, the wire rope isolators could have been replaced with more rigid mass simulators for the sine burst test to remove the source of nonlinearity. However, the wire rope isolators were required for the random vibration test, so this option would have resulted in a significant number of configuration changes, adding additional time to the schedule and several more fastener insertions into locking Helicoils on the flight hardware.","Lesson ID":25801}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Do not wait until situations are dire to look for remedies. Continually look ahead to what issues might be coming in the future and start mitigating as soon as possible.

{"Recommendation(s)":"1. Perform sample Destructive Physical Analyses (DPAs), part level lot evaluation, and mission, environment, application, and lifetime (MEAL)-based radiation testing regardless of architecture and redundancy. 2.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Charge Li-ion batteries along with a properly configured BMS. In addition, Reference (5) made the following recommendations to mitigate the above thirteen contributing factors: 1a.

Develop guidelines for appropriate battery operating and storage procedures that preclude charging cells\/batteries that have low (i.e., below a safe threshold) voltage prior to charging. 2a. Charge the battery in a designated area with a properly functioning BMS. 2b.

Repairs and modifications outside of vendor warranties and vendor specifications should be engineered with procedural steps approved and verified by a JPL battery subject matter expert. 6a. Develop guidelines for the charging test area. 6b Include battery use as a checklist item during the Pre-OSR process: engage review of the battery by a subject matter expert, ensure that written battery operating and storage procedures are in place, and ensure that the associated safety risks are addressed and understood. 7a. Develop guidelines for appropriate Li-ion battery operating and storage procedures that cover limits on charge current. 7b. Ensure that the trickle mode charge current is small enough, per guidelines, to prevent any hazard in the worst-case scenario (e.g., failed cells or strings). 8a. Ensure that the BMS, configured with appropriate alerts and inhibits, is engaged during charging. This should be supplemented with other alert systems, which may include audible alarms or automatic texts or e-mails to users. 8b. Set up a redundant alarm system (i.e., over-voltage and\/or over-temperature) while charging high voltage\/capacity Li-ion batteries. 9a.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Challenge your assumptions. MSL\u2019s relatively slow speed across the Martian terrain led the project to focus on wheel design for semi-static loads, which are consistent with testing with a single wheel. Achieve consensus. During Phase A, ensure that the project team agrees to a common definition of the worst case surface terrain configuration (Reference (8)). Provide margin. If you don\u2019t understand an environment, provide \u2018well-margined\u2019 capabilities to encompass the worst case. Mitigate the overall risk of planetary missions through (1) rigorous assessment of the major known environmental risk contributors and (2) provision of design capabilities to counter critical environmental risks at the upper bounds of their probable severity, with substantial margin. Specific to Curiosity, Reference (3), Sec. 5.0, provides the following recommendations to the Mars 2020 (M2020) project (and other future planetary rovers): Terrains to Avoid. Maximize driving on \u201cwheel friendly\u201d terrain. The correlation between wheel damage and harsh terrain appears high. Areas with a large amount of ~8 centimeters (cm) or larger sharply pointed ventifacts in sand, with no available \u201crock-free\u201d paths, appear to be among the worst types of terrain to drive over. Smaller ventifacts, capable of engaging the inter-grouser wheel \u2018skin,\u2019 which lie loosely on hard bedrock are of equal concern. Preferred Terrains. For maximizing wheel life the preferred terrains include sandy (cohesionless) or cohesive regolith terrains, with few and avoidable large rocks\/ventifacts, and few ventifacts in general larger than 8 cm (the size threshold below which these rocks typically get pushed into the soil by the vehicle). Generally, the observation of consistent (uninterrupted) wheel tracks is thought to be an indication of good terrain for maximizing wheel life. Driving Mode. Consider driving in reverse over particularly challenging terrain, provided that the additional steering can be planned for a safe location and if the additional distance caused by the steering is not a large fraction of the distance driven on that particular sol. Monitor Wheels. Periodically (~500 meters) inspect all six wheels for damage. This will allow early identification of any significant changes in damage trends and provide more data to correlate with the terrains. Wheel Life Improvement. The best way in which to improve wheel life would be to develop a torque controlled driving mode, such that the torque on the other wheels can be reduced as the wheel encountering the obstacle is traversing it. Because of the current damage state of the wheels, even this type of new mode will not prevent damage from continuing, as the load threshold has been reduced due to the existing punctures. Nevertheless, this type of driving mode, if implemented correctly, is likely to result in reduced wheel damage. Rock Detection. Develop higher fidelity rock detection for auto nav drives. In certain terrains, if auto nav could detect and avoid sharp, pointy ventifacts greater than 8 cm in sandy terrain, damage to the wheels could be reduced.","Lesson ID":22401}

Give project managers whose experience is mainly with the project development phases some operational experience so they appreciate that the design tradeoffs they make can have operational implications. Provide robust fault protection and redundancy to allow Operations to trade functional redundancy for flexibility and performance. Facing catastrophic mission failure, persevere to bring in the most experienced, imaginative, and determined NASA Center and subcontractor team personnel. Provide ample margin so the project need not depend upon luck. Never give up-- unless they take away your charge number.","Lesson ID":22502}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For operational responsiveness while minimizing the size of the mission operations team, implement a mission operations automation architecture that features multi-layered autonomy with modular elements building upon each other to accomplish functions that are more complex. Test all paths (nominal and off-nominal) for these ground-based elements at multiple levels, including the highest fidelity testbed available and an extensive on-orbit campaign, to ensure the elements work together as planned. References (1) and (4) provide some specific lessons learned\/recommendations: \u201cLights out\u201d operation was largely attributable to management believing it was possible and then empowering the developers to accomplish it. When negotiating interfaces with other, larger, legacy systems such as AMPCS, the project should ask for just the basics so it can make rapid changes. (Larger systems are less agile, with their own priorities and development schedules.) If possible, utilize developers with operational and test experience. Interfacing with the Near Earth Network\/Space Network was a challenge because every antenna and every ground station has differences (e.g., in the protocols and configurations). Providing automated components with access to existing multi-mission software presented difficulties. For example, it was not feasible to enable automated access to all AMPCS features. Once an operations component is automated, it can scale fairly easily. Profiling and monitoring a distributed system may be difficult, and it could have been done better for SMAP. (After some tuning, system level monitoring was effective; but monitoring individual applications and their performance could have been improved.) The gradual \u201cphase in\u201d of automation was both necessary and valuable.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Thermal strap designs tend to use pure materials that are excellent at conducting heat but not necessarily at maintaining structural integrity. Limitations in these materials and designs need to be considered: 1100 series aluminum, a popular material for thermal joints, mechanically creeps over time at room temperature in both tension and compression Soft materials with threaded holes, such as 1100 series aluminum, are not strong enough for the design of proper mechanical joints (where a bolt should fail prior to the parent, threaded material) even with thread enhancements such as helicoils when using standard flight fasteners Threaded holes\/inserts in aluminum 1100 should be avoided if at all possible (a through hole with a bolt and nut or nut plate is a better option) When soft materials are used, every effort should be made to distribute the pressure area of bolted joint to as large an area as possible Designs shall take into account changes in preload over the lifetime of the joint, including pre-launch dwell time at room temperature as well as the typical operational environments.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Ensure all software packages are kept up-to-date with the latest official release. This will likely cause the project to incur additional operations cost (including development and regression testing) and should be included up-front in the project plan and estimate. Do not accept (or at least critically evaluate) software packages that are not well-maintained and do not have a healthy user community. Do not accept (or at least critically evaluate) software packages that do not have a security bulletin \/ notification process. Critically evaluate software packages that have many dependencies, as this can make it more difficult to maintain this software and upgrade on short notice, if need-be. Maintain an approved IT Security Plan that addresses software patch update processes and an Incident Response Plan. At a minimum, conduct Incident Response plan drills annually. Actively seek out security bulletins and information that may be posted on less conventional security news distribution networks. As an example, actively monitor Metasploit (and other penetration testing software) package additions. Active monitoring of CVEs is likely not sufficient, especially when dealing with zero-day exploits.

Avoid handsoldering, but when necessary, perform thermal preconditioning of parts and boards to avoid thermal shock. Watch for signs of leakage current during testing.","Lesson ID":18502}
{"Recommendation(s)":"During hazardous operations, there should be a person with training and authority at the location of the operation dedicated to ensuring safe practices. The primary responsible party for safety should be an individual or organization, preferably independent from the \"operations implementation organization,\" and without a direct responsibility for mission success. A complete hazard analysis should be performed and documented before any operation that involves significant amount of energy stored or transferred or other potential for injury to people or damage to property. Before performing operations involving hardware storing or transferring large amounts of energy or having the potential to injure people or damage property, operations and safety procedures should be in place and validated, and specifications, limitations, and operating bounds for the hardware reviewed and understood by the performing team and safety personnel. Management should be tuned into the safety practices for any project that involves storing or transferring significant amounts of energy or other potential for injury to people or damage to property, and should audit these practices regularly. The cost to ensure safety, is much less than the cost of reparations for significant injury or death, delay of the program, or repair and replacement of equipment, facilities and scientific instruments. Repeated hazardous operations must be reviewed periodically to ensure that all hazards have been identified and that mitigating procedures are complete. In addition, audits should be conducted to ensure that safety procedures are being followed. All hazardous operations should be reviewed for potential hazards to the public.","Lesson ID":18503}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Reference (3) recommends: Question whenever you or your group are very sure of something (\u201cknown knowns\u201d) for PDR. Make sure you perform all the steps of requirements tracing and verification, even when it is easy. Identify \u201ckey\u201d requirements for special treatment. \u201cKey\u201d is determined by the customer: determine consistent definitions and how you use them. Conduct a deep vertical review (Level 1 to Level 5) of the design against \u201ckey\u201d requirements; this should include a \u201croll up\u201d of verification from Level 4 to Level 1 for PDR. Ensure that \u201ckey\u201d requirements flow down to at least Level 4 and are verified at Level 4. Revisit \u201ckey\u201d requirements at all gate reviews: do not drop a key requirement easily. Identify the polarization on drawings or by means of any other methods of design capture used. This should be treated similar to attitude control phasing. Include predictions of test results that verify requirements in procedures. Does not include calibration (Note: This requires both a comprehensive understanding of the end-to-end flight instrument requirements, and the details of the integration and test approach and instrumentation.) Repeat peer review when there is a moderate\/significant design change, including a thorough review of the change documentation. The review board membership should have the ability to penetrate the technical design and the fundamental measurement being taken. The project team (and not just the Principal Investigator and the contractor system engineer for the instrument) should have the responsibility and resources to penetrate the instrument technical design. The Engineering Change Request process should be strengthened to be technically rigorous with regards to the validation of all levels of requirements that were affected by the change. Reinforce the requirement for PDR and CDR to explicitly show that \u201dthe design meets its requirements with margin\u201d by means of objective evidence. This needs to be done for not just Level 4, but also for Levels 3, 2, and 1 (i.e., roll up performance to demonstrate that the requirements are met).

{"Recommendation(s)":"Reference (2) summarizes the findings from development and test of the SMAP RBA: 1. As a critical element in an integrated flight system, the Deployable Reflector requires exceptional scrutiny in design and test: The project should expect that a large deployable reflector will create the need for design, analysis, and possibly testing iterations among the deployable structure, the mission, the instrument, the flight system, and the launch vehicle elements. The project should subject complex, single-use, deployables design and test to a similar depth of engineering penetration as used for EDL (Entry, Descent and Landing) on planetary missions. 2. Verification and validation by analysis is required for complex deployables, and partner capabilities should be verified and certified: The JPL team should review the subcontractor\u2019s models and simulations, and JPL may elect to conduct independent modeling and simulation. All significant models should be identified, and a careful distinction should be made as to which models are mission critical. Models are considered critical when they are the primary means of design or the primary means for requirement verification. Mission critical models should be tracked at the Project System Engineer (PSE) level. A clear process for model development should be documented, and validation tests developed, reviewed, planned and executed. Engage mechanical systems engineers as leaders and owners of the deployable models; routine finite element modeling practices and approaches will not likely be sufficient. Retain modeling experts to serve as trusted reviewers. Use informal peer reviews rather than multi-day project milestone reviews as a means to determine the sufficiency of models and simulation results. Work Category A waivers and test-as-you-fly exceptions early in the project lifecycle and be sure all stakeholders are aware of the implications and accept the plan. Revisit these waivers and exceptions periodically as the hardware design and test plans mature. For systems dependent on models for final verification, a model verification plan should be developed that includes all tests and component characterizations required to validate or update the model. Projects should understand the system\u2019s (e.g., RBA\u2019s) sensitivity to component variability. 3. Be critical of heritage claims, as each deployable reflector will be a custom implementation: Before vendor selection, ensure that study contracts thoroughly examine and document the true heritage state. However, be aware that study contracts are cursory in nature and do not ensure that the future design process will continue to retain design heritage elements. Assumptions made at the beginning of a design should be reviewed and challenged throughout the design process. Fabrication of an engineering development unit (EDU) may assist in identifying design and implementation flaws and risks (Reference (4)). Ensure that development and testing plans reflect the true state of heritage. Where possible, discuss with prior customers their experience with product development. Engage technical experts to advise the project on the risks being faced. Cost reserves should be higher for systems that are especially difficult to scale, design, and test. Cost estimates for future projects should take into account the vendor\u2019s past cost growth from the proposed cost to the actual cost of the previously delivered product. Also, consider past actual workforce levels for engineering oversight, modeling, quality assurance, and other support, and add increased cost reserves. For procurement of newly developed mechanical systems that include mechanisms, cost growth can have high uncertainty. 4. The \u201cbench depth\u201d of the vendor partner will be important: Requests for Proposals should ask for data on supplier resources and on the percentage of total capacity that the proposed effort would consume over each development phase. Information on current and\/or forecast business loading that could compete for resources is also valuable, accompanied by an assessment of how competing work and priorities would be resolved. A \u201ckey personnel clause\u201d may be advisable for key contractor personnel (program manager, lead system engineer, etc.) Early engagement of the JPL line organization in vendor oversight, though it may incur additional cost, has value and is critical in ensuring that technical issues can be expeditiously addressed. 5. Vendor partner management practices contributed to the difficulties: Evaluate prospective vendors for their recent experience managing contracts of the type, scope, and value similar to the proposed development. Evaluation should include the existence and experience with their proposed management tools and practices to support the proposed effort. This includes financial, schedule, and earned value reporting. Assure that key individuals are assigned clear, overall responsibility for their elements (engineering, manufacturing, and test). Recognize that vendor organizational structures may be compartmentalized into vertical silos with ambiguous lines of communication and responsibility between engineering, manufacturing and test. Address these issues early with the vendor. JPL should include strong provisions in the contract for an in-plant technical, quality, and management presence by JPL including, where needed, unescorted access to all areas where JPL work is performed, and provision of office accommodations and internet\/phones. Such provisions should be staffed early in the contract lifecycle to establish an early precedent for JPL engagement in contractor work. JPL should include strong provisions in the contract for the delivery at milestone reviews of a complete design package that provides, if it later proves necessary, sufficient information to bring the work in house. This should include options for obtaining support by key vendor personnel (e.g., supplying copies of design packages) so the work can be completed.. The source selection process should feature detailed reviews of vendor engineering, quality, production practices, and technical tools (CAD systems, analytical models, etc.). Where they differ from the JPL Design Principles and JPL quality requirements, the departures should be assessed for risk. 6. Carefully planned contract details can ease off-nominal situations: Projects should plan for staffing by a full-time Contract Technical Manager, full-time Cognizant Engineer, and significant support engineering staffing for the technical disciplines (e.g., thermal, materials & processes, structural, dynamics, and electrical engineering). Consider an award fee contract approach to incentivize vendors to address future situations and performance issues that might arise over the contract\u2019s lifespan. Consider using contract language to allow JPL access as in-plant\/resident engineer-- to facilitate system engineer interactions and to bridge the JPL and vendor teams. The contract provisions should also cover the issues discussed in Recommendation #5.","Lesson ID":16501}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Ensure that part test results, particularly results with negative outcomes, are widely distributed to the appropriate system design personnel. This will allow the part user community to select alternate parts, design systems to cope with the part vulnerabilities, or use as-is.

{"Recommendation(s)":"The JPL Deep Space Atomic Clock project team realized brazing development was necessary to ensure successful hardware manufacturing and assembly, and took steps to explore the best brazing process for their application. The lessons learned and the JPL approach should be considered a model for how NASA should work with vendors in the future. From the JPL-Deep Space Atomic Clock best practices that apply to these lessons: \u2022 Pre-Qualify vendors that have both a low-rate, R&D capability as well as a high-rate production side. o Fund the vendor to assess their current processes for applicability to new work. o Don't compete process development unless you have a huge flight quantity order. \u2022 View the vendor as a development partner. Their success is your success, and vice versa. \u2022 Use multiple vendors for process development to maximize potential for success. o This requires additional and focused team support for each vendor \u2022 Interface with the vendor at the detailed engineering level. Don't depend on high-level company contacts, especially for highly technical discussions. \u2022 Structure Sub-Contracts or PO's such that NASA owns the resulting development process. o This may seem to cost more, but it lessens the difficulty with cross-fertilization of knowledge between vendors and enables more flexibility later on in competing brazing services using the developed process. \u2022 Use specific, step-wise PO's or contract deliverables to work through the Non-recurring engineering (NRE) portion. o Predicate flight deliverables on success during NRE work. o This moves the risk to NASA, which is advantageous for small, specialized vendors. \u2022 Use ample runs of coupons to be evaluated by both vendor and NASA. \u2022 Execute tight team coordination between vendor and NASA (weekly) during NRE phases. \u2022 Interact with vendor's 3rd tier vendors to ensure the process will not be sub-sub-contracted. In summary, this team of SMEs uncovered a common thread throughout most of the projects assessed \u2013 the lack of brazing development can result in inadequate process results and substandard parts. Brazing is a very specific, potentially complex process that is also extremely useful to join materials. Brazing cannot and should not be viewed as the best, lowest cost process for all applications. Mechanical joints, welded joints, or the elimination of joints in addition to brazing must be considered in the design. As a side note, after addressing these aforementioned issues, it might be a misnomer to refer to this team as a ''tiger team\". It is recommended that this team of brazing SMEs be referred as the Brazing Investigation and Response Team (BIRT). Though this team can perform as a true tiger team, the team believes NASA's best interests would be served by this using the \"BIRT' as a floating (as opposed to standing) Agency resource to proactively address and\/or be available to advise projects on an as needed basis.","Lesson ID":14001}

The flight crew should practice the actual flight test procedures with a low-cost radio control model to dry run the procedures and facilitate critical communications between the flight crew during flight, e.g., do not land and go around if the airspeed exceeds a target value. The pilot should be allowed some time on the first flights to perform handling qualities maneuvers at altitudes that support safe recovery from low airspeed maneuvers such as slow flight, stalls and landing configurations.

{"Recommendation(s)":"The following recommendations are derived from Reference (1): Assure that a thorough review of all Certification Data Packages accompanying received Ti alloys is performed by trained and experienced Materials & Processes (M&P) engineers, Procurement Quality Assurance (PQA) specialists, or equivalent personnel. Material suppliers should be Nadcap (National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program) certified, and they should be audited and approved by PQA and M&P engineers and placed on an Approved Suppliers List (ASL). Ti materials for flight applications should only be procured from suppliers on the ASL. Ensure that quality clauses regarding material have sufficiently detailed requirements to assure that mill certifications, processing certifications, and testing certifications will be received with material or procured metal parts. All procurements should require that the material type and specifications be listed in the contract. Each drawing should identify the material type and specification in accordance with References (4) and (5). Material testing should be performed on a sample basis to validate the supplier\u2019s material test reports. More information about procedures and processes that help mitigate the procurement of nonconforming Ti alloys can be found in References (1) and (2).","Lesson ID":12901}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Recommendations No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 in Reference (3) are also valid for this lesson learned. Reference (3) calls for validation of maintenance agreements, surveys to assure planned maintenance is performed, checks of critical equipment against manufacturer recommendations, remote monitoring of malfunctions, and isolation of the mishap scene. In addition, the Madrid incident warrants the following: The fire alarm detection system in the complex\u2019s powerplant Converter Room or the converter Battery Rooms should be interlocked with the power plant controller and the converters to take appropriate actions based on the location of the alarm initiation. The Static Converter should be equipped with a DC bus ground fault detection system to automatically shut down the converter battery charging system. The battery mounting should be able to provide an electrical isolation between the battery and battery rack, such that if the electrolyte leaks, a conductive path to ground is not generated. Ensure and verify maintenance personnel are properly trained such that the correct maintenance procedures are executed, the records of maintenance activities are properly recorded, the maintenance status is tracked, and unsafe conditions are immediately reported. Clear written instructions in both English and the predominant local language should be readily available, along with training of the Supervisor on Duty and designated staff, on how to respond to an emergency situation involving the converters and batteries. Provide site-specific information to the local Fire Brigade for training and familiarization with the complex and its unique operations and hazards. Sensitize the personnel stationed at the facility with OSHA regulations (or OSHA-equivalent rules for foreign facilities) and local emergency services practices. Install a portable fire extinguisher outside each door leading to the battery room and provide portable fire extinguisher training.","Lesson ID":12401}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Facilities should regularly check and validate the maintenance agreements and responsibilities for all laboratory UPS systems, regardless of the equipment funding source. All UPS systems require annual preventative maintenance. JPL Facilities should maintain a comprehensive survey of JPL critical systems to ensure that all critical equipment is scheduled to receive required maintenance (Reference (3)). Track the maintenance status, and immediately report unsafe conditions. Institute checks to assure that those responsible for safety-critical and operations-critical facility equipment comply with established maintenance and test as per the manufacturer recommendations. Equip all UPS units with visible and audio warning systems for timely recognition and remote monitoring of malfunctions. Equip all UPS battery chargers to automatically stop battery charging and automatically isolate batteries upon over-temperature detection. Because visible and audible warnings may not be observed outside of regular working hours, tie the alarms directly to a central alarm system. Institute an alarm response procedure that includes action by the building occupants, safety personnel, Facilities, Protective Services, and (where applicable) external emergency response agencies.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Reference (4) provides a list of flaws in the MSL actuator mechanical design process, including poorly defined performance requirements, lack of established technical milestones, design incompatibilities, and inadequate verification. 1. Lesson Learned - Mass reduction without consideration of technical and programmatic impacts can lead to significant subsystem development dependencies, schedule delays, and in some cases, design weaknesses (References (4) and (5)): 1a) Optimization\/Reduction Across Interfaces Planetary rovers and Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) systems are as volume-constrained as they are mass-constrained. In pursuit of minimizing mass and volume, the MSL RA joint bearings were incorporated into the drive actuators. Thus, a functional robotic arm could not exist without the actuators, and the RA development schedule was held hostage by a delayed actuator development schedule. Recomendation 1a) A configuration that results in the drive actuators being integral to the subsystem structure causes significant development schedule dependences. Specification of the external loading requirements (particularly cross-moment loading cases) must be defined very early in the design phase to enable a timely actuator procurement. (See Item #7 below regarding long lead-time procurement of bearings.) 1b) Mass Reduction vs. Manufacturability The original plan was to develop \"a catalog\" of a few motor types and gearbox sizes, which subsystem users could mix and match at Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Actuator procurement was significantly delayed because subsystem users specified a custom actuator for each application in pursuit of minimizing mass and volume. (The original purpose for developing titanium gearing was for mass reduction, but the increased volume required compared to a conventional steel gearbox was not taken into consideration.) The number of variations on a similar design exploded, with many gear stages that differed only in the width of the gear. Recomendation 1b) There are significant schedule ramifications in mass optimization of numerous actuator types. Minimization of mass is an important pursuit, but project management must balance the amount of mass reduction against manufacturability-- number of drawings produced, parts count, management of parts inventory, and manufacturing cost\/schedule. 1c) Mass Optimization Resulting in Poor Design Configuration The MSL Low-Power High Torque Actuator (LPHTA) with its A500 motor, and to some extent the A300 motors, exhibited speed and torque instability that was never fully understood or fixed-- only mitigated. The symptoms occurred somewhat randomly, but were ultimately blamed on a combination of rotational non-concentricities, bearing clearance fits, \"springy\" bearing preload, unbalanced rotors, and a three-bearing design to accommodate the encoder. Prioritizing mass and volume reduction resulted in a non-optimum MSL motor mechanical configuration, producing a number of functional imperfections that most likely were the root source of operating dynamics problems. (Reference 6.) Recomendation 1c) The motor design process should place a priority on controlling concentricity of the rotating mass, tight-fitting bearings that still allow easy disassembly, consistent bearing preload, and avoiding a three-bearing configuration. (This issue is also related to LL #5 regarding a breakdown in the design review process.) 2. Lesson Learned \u2013 The motor encoder implementation was susceptible to magnetic disruption from the motor\/brake. The motor cold encoder was not tested in the proximity of the power-off brake early in the development program. The cold encoder also presented functional idiosyncrasies (in concert with the drive electronics) that were difficult to characterize and mitigate. Recomendation 2) Verify motor encoder design compatibility with magnetics in Phase B, or very early in Phase C. Should any of the three elements in a controlled-drive design (i.e., motor, feedback device, and drive electronics) not be fully developed, avoid design configurations that are magnetically sensitive. 3. Lesson Learned - Qualification of a new actuator material\/lubricant application in the flight program: 3a) Validation of New Application. The supplier failed to retain the data from MER-- the heritage program that utilized the dry lube process proposed for MSL. Evidence of process efficacy was not pursued by JPL until failures were experienced in the MSL developmental life test program. The one MER hardware example still available was the Lander Petal Actuator (LPA), which had passed its much shorter cycle life qualification test for the MER project. (The MSL developmental life test unit design was derived from the MER LPA.) The MER LPA qualification life test unit was again disassembled and re-inspected under magnification. It was determined that the dry lube and gearing failure observed in the MSL development unit was just beginning in that MER unit, but at a fraction of the MSL design life. Hence, the MSL project reverted to a wet lubrication scheme for the gearing. Implementation of titanium gearing was fraught with development problems not related to lubrication. As is common with the use of titanium, many problems were ultimately traced to the low thermal conductivity of the material. Accommodation of the thermal gradients within the gearbox and use of hard surface coatings might have eventually produced a successful titanium gearing design. Instead, JPL went with \"conventional\" steel materials, but using the (larger) titanium gearing design configuration. Recomendation 3a) Demand a higher standard of proof-of-readiness prior to incorporation of risky new technology. This proof did not exist at the time the MSL project chose to implement titanium gearing (for mass reduction) and dry lubricant gear coating (for cryogenic operation without active heating). 3b) Fall-back plan for New Technology. A steel gearbox approach concurrent with a titanium gearbox design program would have increased the initial costs (plus the need for more staff), but it would have been ready for implementation if the titanium gearing design approach failed. Furthermore, this would have provided an accurate design trade of mass and volume between the two approaches. MSL switched to the conventional steel gearing and conventional wet lubrication once the development problems couldn\u2019t be solved quickly, but retained the larger gearing design intended for the titanium material to preserve cost and schedule. Recomendation 3b) Whenever new technology is incorporated in the baseline design of the flight system, a heritage technology \"fall-back\" implementation should be concurrently developed until the new technology is validated. 4. Lesson Learned - Out-of-Phase Development The Critical Design Review (CDR) schedules for the actuators slipped until mid-2007, yet extremely important requirements such as output torque, external loading, and cycle life were fuzzy. Disconnects such as \"what side of the interface does torque margin reside\" resulted in the need to submit waivers to institutional requirements. Recomendation 4) Avoid out-of-phase project development, which in this case resulted from \"re-architecture\" of the MSL Surface Sampling System in spring 2007. The detailed performance requirements for the Sampling System actuators were determined well after detailed design had begun in the winter of 2006. 5. Lesson Learned - Breakdown of the design review process: 5a) Gate Reviews Not Actually Passed. Although over 200 requests for action (RFAs) were submitted as a result of the design reviews, few were closed by the supplier. In some cases delta-reviews were convened, and in some of those reviews, some of the action items were answered. Due to limited staffing at JPL and at the supplier, there was a lack of attention to closing major open items identified in the reviews. Also, there were a number of glaring design deficiencies that were only identified after testing had begun. JPL and the supplier were operating nearly continuously in \"recovery mode\" from ongoing test anomalies. In some cases poor design features were identified, but they were left unchanged in an attempt to preserve schedule. Few Actuator design reviews were truly \"passed,\" but extreme schedule pressure demanded that production proceed. Although it was hoped that design weaknesses would be retired concurrently, there was not enough JPL and supplier staff to accomplish this. In hindsight, a few of the significant hardware failures were traced to design review RFAs that did not receive timely or adequate attention. Recomendation 5a) It is imperative RFAs be dispositioned and retired in a timely manner, particularly for a deliverable such as the MSL actuators that are integral to multiple subsystems. Workforce resources need to be applied to manage design review actions so manufacturing doesn\u2019t build-in design weaknesses that cannot be rectified at a later date. 5b) Review of vendor competency. The actuator supplier had demonstrated good technical performance in the past, and JPL anticipated similar performance for MSL. However, the supplier had subsequently reorganized staff roles and lost some core competencies. This was not clearly recognized by the MSL project until the actuator designs were already in production. (See Item #5a.) As another example, the JPL Dawn mission launched in 2007 had planned to use the same ion propulsion system design that was successfully demonstrated by the JPL Deep Space 1 spacecraft, only to find that the supplier\u2019s technical and management capabilities had significantly degraded during the 6-year lag between the two projects (Reference (7)). Recomendation 5b) The design reviews did not adequately assess the competency of the supplier staff to produce the product. This largely occurred due to the incomplete nature of the review materials, which tended to hide or defer to later the detailed technical weaknesses and corrective actions. Preliminary design reviews must strive to evaluate the competency of the supplier and its staff as well as the technical design. Both Dawn and MSL point out the need to \u201cre-qualify\u201d subcontractors who bid to produce mission-critical components. (See Item 6.) 6. Lesson Learned - Excessive Scope to Design, Test & Deliver Large Production Quantities The actuator development task consisted of too much work, too many deliverables, in too short a schedule\u2014a key finding. The development schedule slipped as the procurement concept changed from \"a catalog of component assemblies to select from\" to custom actuators for specific applications (per Item #1b above). The decision to procure all of the actuators from one supplier was extremely risky, and JPL paid dearly in cost and schedule. Eventually, splitting a quantity of small actuators from the primary supplier to another (who performed very well) greatly enabled the eventual success of the actuator subsystem. The final actuator ship-set for MSL was 31 actuators in 13 configurations, and the total quantity procured was 90 units! Seven large dynamometers were fabricated to permit concurrent acceptance testing. The development schedule was compressed to an insufficient duration due to delayed requirements definition. The complexity of the designs was complicated by mass reduction efforts and changing requirements as the various subsystem customers for the actuators refined their needs. An unfortunate result of the schedule slip for the design phase was that the scope of work to design and implement testing resources compromised the flight hardware development efforts. The large quantity of deliverable hardware over a relatively short duration overstretched supplier and JPL staff resources. Recomendation 6) Track the cost-to-complete and schedule-to-complete throughout project development, and allocate project reserves as necessary to retire major project development risks. Consider obtaining a second source for complex critical components acquired in quantity. 7. Lesson Learned - Rolling Element Bearings Procurement is Extremely Long-Lead Today, there are fewer ball bearing suppliers, and they are less willing to respond rapidly to customers who have unusual requirements and purchase in small quantities. Therefore, design changes demanding a change in bearing size or type often cannot be accomplished without a serious impact to schedule. Recomendation 7) Since the load cases define the size of the bearings, the difficulties of long-lead procurement were exacerbated by delays in determining external load cases per Item #4 and by the complexity of the usage cases of the subsystems per Item #1. Recognize that acquisition of rolling element bearings is a fundamental pacing item for production of actuators.","Lesson ID":11501}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Provide the basic foundational documentation at the onset of the project. Some items that should be included are: - A simple Concept of Operations description, even in pictorial form. Reference to this ConOps will allow for the team to stay on the same page and make good decisions when issues arise. - A schedule, readily accessible to the entire team, updated twice a week during high-volume work periods such as testing. Schedule Developer will be best able to perform this by integrating into the team and following the work. This will relieve the rest of the team from the burden of reporting status. - A listing of all identifiable risks and at a minimum a skeleton of a mitigation strategy to be followed in the event that the risk turns into an issue. This will give all team members a basis upon which to make decisions and execute tasks more quickly while staying aligned with the agreed-upon process. The team should have a schedule and a designated scheduler. The schedule should be updated when information is available and during team meetings. Flexibility should be built into all plans and procedures, to allow for alternate paths when problems arise. Careful thought should be given to the necessary approval process for changes to agreed-upon plans to ensure that proper authorization is given without burdening the flow of work with unnecessary steps. Existing Organizational Work Instructions (OWI) should be reviewed and modified as appropriate to allow for the required flexibility. The ISERV team implemented a bi-weekly integration status meeting toward the end to meet pre-ship schedule. The meeting proved to be beneficial and kept the hardware in flow with little to no wait time because the team knew what to expect and when it was to occur. This could have been started a little earlier perhaps. Seek out local help with database inputs before going to JSC for help. Check internally to see if another project, such as MSG, might have experience with the system\/database. Before management commits to a project like ISERV, there needs to be a thorough assessment of the job performed by Engineering along with the Project Office. The core engineering team that will be responsible for the project needs to be in place and a part of the development of a project proposal. Explicitly define and agree to the qualification requirements and processes up front, involving all stakeholders in the agreement negotiations at the start of the project.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Hardware Assembly and Clean Room Conditions 1. Housekeeping is an absolute must in clean rooms, and anywhere bonding operations are conducted 2. Silicone contaminates surfaces easily and spreads easily. Maintain control of materials containing silicone in lab areas. Failure Investigation: When a failure occurs, stop work immediately and do not attempt to \u201cfix\u201d the problem to see if the fix reveals the problem. Preserve the failure site at all costs. Data must be collected. Opinions and speculation are not data. Measurements, spectra, images, etc. are data. Collect data. It often takes less time to run tests and get analyses than it does to meet often to reach consensus on a hypothetical solution. Focus on what the data reveals. Do not be lead down a path except the one the data offers. Do not let strong personalities with no data override more timid personalities with good data. Provide all information that is available to the team. An investigative team can never have too much information, but it can have too little. When a failure occurs, get a failure analyst involved. Other experts on the team are essential but failure investigations should include failure investigators trained in failure analysis techniques, equipment, and methodologies. The investigation should be conducted by independent sources because they will be objective. Using ONLY information from the people closely working with the failed equipment invites subjectivity because they tend to take pride of ownership and they can misconstrue the results for a variety of reasons. Failures due to manufacturing defects are more clearly resolved if a pristine sample is provided. This is because \u201cout-of-family\u201d characteristics are typically used to point back to manufacturing issues. You cannot have \u201cout-of-family\u201d statistics if all you have is the failed component. Certain circumstances may prevent this, which reduces the robustness of the root cause assessment pointing back to manufacturing. Having a pristine sample of the expected and nominal condition strongly supports the credibility of the assessment. Silicone and its use must be understood and controlled. Proper training should be required for anyone working in laboratories, especially in bonding operations in identifying its characteristics, impacts on hardware processing, and proper control, clean up, and storage.","Lesson ID":9001}

{"Recommendation(s)":"The table below lists the specific recommendations, identified by the JPL Operations Working Group (Reference (1)), to be considered by ongoing and future flight projects. Categories Operations Recommendations Development Recommendations Test-bed\/ simulation\/ modeling Maintain a rigorous review process of the test-bed results; functionally verify whenever possible Implement a fast simulator (faster than real-time) for operations Implement a test-bed time jump capability Work on spacecraft models and simulations while still in Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations (ATLO) and continually update throughout operations. Historically, flight rules come in late in the development process as subsystem experts are involved in testing of their flight hardware. Spacecraft state\/parameter tracking Implement an automated flight system state\/parameter tracking system that ties the uplink command system to the downlink telemetry (What was commanded \u2013 What was expected \u2013 What was seen). Do not allow invisible onboard application-to-application commanding resulting in no visibility of parameter states. Ensure every command has a default value. Ensure all commandable states can be seen in downlink telemetry. Operations sustainability Perform and document a thorough tabletop planning session at the beginning of each uplink activity to include as a minimum beginning\/ending spacecraft states, detailed verification\/validation plans, transmission constraints, and contingency commands. Look for ways to bring back technical experts for subsystem parameter reviews prior to critical events. (Loss of corporate knowledge is a significant risk item as the operations continues.) Perform a detailed technical review of the impact to other subsystems in the presence of a spacecraft hardware anomaly (as part of the daily operational activity of the flight team). Plan and fund for software tool modifications and periodic hardware upgrades to keep up with the flight system changes as flight operations goes along (including extended missions). Perform a detailed technical spacecraft subsystem review when transitioning from the primary to the extended mission, including key documentation. Set up a schedule to update operational procedures on a regular basis (quarterly, semi-annually, annually), and engage flight team members in the activity. Maintain the spacecraft idiosyncrasy document throughout the testing and operations phase of a project. Maintain an operational risk management process throughout operations. Include as part of a project's closeout activities a thorough review and possible changes to the spacecraft states with a view toward a follow-on mission. (The spacecraft should be placed in a known and documented configuration in anticipation of follow-on activity.) Operations development Incorporate extended mission requirements early in the design of flight and ground systems. Develop requirement for an operations environment that is easily maintained and documented. This may include the implementation of a model based engineering effort. Identify flight operational tools early in the development process to ensure availability for flight operations. Consider performing a wholesale SEQGEN revitalization effort. Operations training Loss of experienced personnel needs to be supplemented with a well-defined training program for new flight team personnel coming into operations. Implement a flight team training program throughout the mission operations phase including: anomaly response exercises, flight team schools, operational error case studies, review of operational procedures, etc. Implement a flight team certification process tied, in part, to the training program. Certification should assess the readiness of each individual to perform his\/her assigned duties. Team members should be recertified on a regular basis (yearly or at most every other year). Human Factors Look for ways to keep the flight team engaged in the day-to-day operational activities. Complacency can easily creep in as the mission proceeds and all is going well. While overtime and team fatigue may be inevitable at times (ATLO comes to mind), managers should monitor team fatigue levels and relieve overloads whenever possible. Watch out for individuals oversubscribing themselves. Configuration Management Maintain a rigorous configuration management process with emphasis on command products, testbeds, and operational procedures (nominal and contingency). Operability infusion Include operations personnel on the project systems engineering team early and throughout the project development phase, to facilitate a flight system design that is less error-prone to operate (Reference (3)). Develop and impose appropriate operability requirements on both the flight and ground systems. Establish an operability working group during development to track and address operability issues.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Building construction work should not take place unless it is based on up-to-date configuration drawings. These drawings should be: intelligible located such that are readily accessible to job site personnel under configuration control and marked as appropriate Construction work involving the potential disturbance (mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic) of hazardous systems or states should not take place until a hazard analysis has been accomplished. This analysis should be used to determine what specific safety measures (beyond or in lieu of the standard measures given below) are required to minimize the potential of tripping a hazard, and the consequences should a hazard be tripped. This is particularly true for work such as drilling\/cutting where visual contact of the tool and work surface is not possible (blind penetrations). Standard controls for work (excavations, penetrations) involving the potential disturbance of hazardous systems or states not visually accessible should include: a utility\/hazard locator service whereby ground\/surface scans can identify, locate, and mark potential hazards the de-energizing of the hazardous system the lock-out\/tag-out of the hazardous system use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) selection and use of tools appropriately configured to minimize the potential for harm should they come into contact with or disturb a hazard Centers should establish a maximum floor\/wall\/ceiling penetration depth beyond which a permit is required to ensure the job receives adequate oversight and the applications of the controls mentioned above. The existing building construction\/repair\/maintenance review and permitting processes should be revised to include this maximum penetration depth as a standard review item. Requirements critical to safety should be placed in a document\u2019s body rather than its appendices to ensure such requirements do not get overlooked. Any permits or associated documents referenced by a safety policy should be accessible (preferably within the policy document itself) and periodically reviewed for their currency.","Lesson ID":7156}

Time-critical PEPC requires late and early access to the spacecraft.","Lesson ID":5010}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Identify all the stakeholders early and ensure they are engaged and informed in the process. The stakeholders at the end of the program are not likely to be the same stakeholders at the beginning of the program, especially for a long duration program or project. Understand and scrub the requirements for transitioning and retiring hardware. Over the years, new laws, regulations, and requirements for transitioning and dispositioning of property may be developed that were not anticipated prior to entering the transition and retirement phase. Challenge the requirements and processes used for excessing property. Sometimes, the reason certain processes are in place on long duration projects are not applicable or as important when the transition and retirement\/project close out phase is entered. Efficiencies developed for continued operations over years may not be \u201cefficient\u201d during transition and retirement.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Project and executing institution (NASA Center, Prime Contractor, etc.) experience, strengths, and weaknesses should be considered and factored into SIR timing in the project integration and test flow. If necessary, consider splitting the SIR scope into separate reviews to allow the necessary level of preparation and focus for a successful review. This may be especially appropriate in cases where the project and\/or executing organization is believed to have weaknesses due to little recent relevant experience with the necessary level or type of integration and test required. Clearly communicate and document any review process tailoring.","Lesson ID":6996}
{"Recommendation(s)":"If your organization requires DBAN software for the sanitation of drives before excess, it is well worth your time to load Parted Magic prior to attempting to run DBAN.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Assure that the NASA Center security and facilities organizations are familiar with the configuration and features of fire suppression systems in any leased facilities. For special purpose facilities that may operate without trained personnel present (e.g., data centers, certain hardware test facilities, and mission operations centers), ensure that: Cognizant personnel for critical facilities identify any special measures that need to be taken by first responders during emergency incidents. Security guards are fully trained and aware of their responsibilities as first responders to automated electrical shutdown events. Assure that clear instructions are posted for any special emergency procedures. The instructions should also provide contact information so the guards can promptly inform the responsible person(s) for the facility, and inform Center Facilities about the incident. For major data centers, and for other major facilities having a potentially mission-critical sensitivity to power loss, assess the need for an isolated fire alarm\/suppression system that will not be triggered by an alarm originating in the building\u2019s non-critical spaces.","Lesson ID":6776}

{"Recommendation(s)":"The Heyne design flaws can be addressed by such measures as reverting to the heritage blow-off door design and assessing the suitability of the selected pyrotechnic cutter. However, more rigorous mechanical design practices may prevent such design flaws (Reference (2)): Avoid identical electrical connectors in close proximity. This paragraph, which recommends a practice to prevent mis-mating, has been redacted for ITAR compliance. Select reliable electro-mechanical devices. This paragraph, which advocates use of a particular type of part, has been redacted for ITAR compliance. Adjust microswitches. This paragraph, which proposes a switch adjustment measure, has been redacted for ITAR compliance. Verify pyrotechnic device functional margin. This paragraph, which suggests performing a mechanism test, has been redacted for ITAR compliance. Select screw material, target diameter, and preload. This paragraph, which recommends criteria for developmental testing, has been redacted for ITAR compliance. Implement a process to verify that parts being manufactured for critical payload systems, such as mission success-critical deployment mechanisms, utilize the materials specified on the drawings. Review the adequacy of processes for the control of critical flight hardware during fabrication and assembly. Establish assembly processes that assure that critical flight wiring harnesses are not mis-mated (see Reference (3)), especially on flight projects where there may be frequent changes in the payload team. Flag anticipated changes in payload team personnel during the mission as an additional risk. Implement a process to assure retention of critical payload team knowledge. Plan for launch delays\/scrubs by implementing and witnessing appropriate disassembly procedures.","Lesson ID":6796}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Provide mandatory contamination control training for all project personnel early in project implementation (Reference (2)). The training should not be limited to generic contamination control techniques, but rather should focus on control measures specific to the project facilities and hardware, including: Instrument sensitivities and sensitive surfaces Materials and processes approval and restrictions Surface cleanliness requirements Potential contamination sources Contamination transfer mechanisms Special handling procedures Warning signs that require notification of the Contamination Control authority. Following training of project personnel, continued involvement of the cognizant Contamination Control Engineer in the design and execution of fabrication, assembly and handling plans for contamination-sensitive hardware should be mandatory throughout the project life cycle to reduce the risk of unforeseen, but preventable, contamination events.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Spaceflight projects may derive significant benefits from being AMMOS \u201ccapability-driven,\u201d matching their MOS needs to the established AMMOS capabilities instead of selecting only those AMMOS elements that precisely match mission needs. They should perform a review of the AMMOS system to determine which AMMOS software, tools, and services can be customized to match their mission characteristics, and which project MOS needs are unique and truly require new MOS development.","Lesson ID":6657}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The NASA IV&V Center should continue to retrospectively evaluate their project IV&V performance to identify opportunities for process improvement. Future FSW development contracts should take into account FSW deficiencies identified in the IV&V process. Assure that lessons learned are incorporated into future contracts. This may have a big impact because for spaceflight projects, flight software development is a major contributor among those activities that challenge project cost control. Projects selected for IV&V Services should follow successful models used on earlier spaceflight missions when interacting with the IV&V Center (Reference 1). For example: Line management should hold regular meetings with the IV&V team to resolve cross-project issues, but the PSSE should remain the project\u2019s main point-of-contact with the IV&V team. Full engagement and IV&V support by the project (i.e., project management, the PSSE, and the in-house or contracted FSW management team) are needed to ensure a productive relationship with the IV&V team. Resistance to IV&V team participation, or mere accommodation (e.g., delivering artifacts as requested but otherwise disengaged), will likely lead to a poor return on resource investment. Hence, the project should help structure the IV&V team\u2019s involvement to be success-oriented, and proactively identify and deliver the artifacts that will be useful to them. Establish firm rules of engagement prior to the release of draft artifacts to the IV&V team. The rules should assure that the IV&V team write TIMs only against an agreed upon set of formally released documents. Inappropriate TIMs diminish the credibility of the IV&V product. Applicable IV&V lessons learned from one project should be applied to subsequent missions. For example, the GRAIL project analyzed the impact on post-launch anomalies of 893 TIMS from the Mars Phoenix mission, and used the results to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the GRAIL IV&V activity (Reference (4)).","Lesson ID":6656}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For all in-house spacecraft builds, conduct a final mechanical walkdown of the spacecraft prior to stacking or encapsulation for launch. Use a formal walkdown process similar to MSL's, including preparation of a formal walkdown package (References (1), (4), and (5)), careful selection of expert participants, exercising appropriate caution to avoid hardware damage, conducting periodic debriefs of the participants, and documenting findings for closed-loop tracking to resolution. For out-of-house builds by a spacecraft system contractor, conduct an independent final walkdown and assessment at the contractor facility and the launch vehicle integration site that includes thorough inspections of the spacecraft exterior surfaces, and at least randomly selected spot reviews of closeout procedures and processes. For out-of-house builds, it is necessary to prepare a formal report for the attention of project management.","Lesson ID":6636}

Do not exceed 110 degrees Fahrenheit (tank Operations and Maintenance Requirements Specification Document (OMRSD) limit is 170 degrees Fahrenheit). Upgrade failing sensors and pursue alternate technology. Flowmeters should be designed to allow in-place calibration. Post-clean and lubricate the seat in the Negative Pressure Relief Valve (NPRV); do not inspect the valve seat at every flow, only during full testing of the valve; and include a leak check of the secondary seal cover. Install quantity gaging system to verify fluid level for fire bottles not easily accessible. Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) retest requirements should be driven by criticality and likelihood of failure. Requirements should be tightest at acceptance test plan level (acceptance testing versus Operational Maintenance Requirements and Specifications Document (OMRSD) versus Launch Commit Criteria versus Flight Rules) with the largest margin for flight rules. Design of valves should incorporate position indication telemetry. Develop a bell jar tester to validate feed-through connector integrity as a precursor to the cabin leak check.","Lesson ID":6456}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For system-level thermal testing during ATLO, it is important to unequivocally verify the functionality of all GSE instrumentation prior to closing the chamber doors.","Lesson ID":6696}
{"Recommendation(s)":"There needs to be a Level II document that houses important information required for Integrated Propulsion Analysis.

{"Recommendation(s)":"When writing specifications, take into the account the environment that the equipment is to operate within and write sensible conservative specifications. Once the equipment is built, do not allow waivers to requirements that are derived from the natural environment.","Lesson ID":4416}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Clear links between requirements and verification activities, including specific tests and analyses taken to satisfy the requirements, should be clearly established and maintained through all levels of hierarchy, from top level decision makers to those performing engineering analysis. Formal Detailed Verification Requirements (DVRs) should be strongly linked to test requests, contracts for analyses, and engineering products that support Verification and Validation of system and component design. Including actual DVR references on test requests or work orders that are issued prior to each test or analysis provide concrete and clear traceability and guidance for both the planning of the test or analysis and for the disposition and destination of engineering reports generated from test and analysis. Traceability of detailed verification requirements is the responsibility of each SE&I organization at each level of responsibility. Prior planning and consideration of how task orders and test requests are documented can support and clearly reference the relevant requirements underlying each technical activity. Prior planning prevents poor performance. The risk of not establishing clear links between verification requirements and engineering products should be discussed and understood between project, engineering, and contractor management prior to execution of relevant work tasks. If insight\/oversight models or contractor task order agreements preclude contractor-level managerial or designated governing authority review of deliverable products, the government program\/project manager and government designated governing authority should establish a priori agreement of the risk acceptance and plan for risk mitigation. Key decision makers and stakeholders need to be aware of the potential risks of shortcutting traceability and review tasks.","Lesson ID":6536}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Decompose requirements at the subsystem level and allocate them to the appropriate implementing organizations. Avoid creating unnecessary levels of responsibility for the requirements.","Lesson ID":5201}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Employees should be trained or retrained in tool control practices while working at heights, as well as ascending and descending ladders. The training should include that employees be prohibited from having tool tethers attached to their fall protection harnesses while ascending and descending ladders. Fall protection should be used for fixed ladders less than 24-feet (20-feet for general industry), where the potential exists for a fall beyond the base of the ladder. NASA should ensure that contractors require the proper use of fall protection for tasks exposing workers to falls from unprotected heights. Better coordination between NASA safety and NASA contracting is needed for identification and coverage of ongoing construction projects. Contractors should maintain training documentation to ensure employee training is current for all potential tasks. The use of nylon rope lifelines should be avoided. However, when no other alternative exists, nylon rope should be used in a manner that will not weaken the rope, including the use of knots.NASA safety should attend contractor meetings, and improve communications with all construction contractors and NASA procurement. NASA procurement should invite NASA safety to pre-bid walk-downs. That should provide NASA safety with information about where work will be performed. In addition, it will be useful for the safety planning process and for improving communications between the organizations.","Lesson ID":5996}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Although development of flight systems should take precedence, ensure that ground systems and vehicle development teams continuously share design input (i.e., real-time collaborative CAD models) with each other. One effective method to accommodate KSC ground processing requirements in the design of the integrated flight hardware (JSC\/MSFC) and ground hardware (KSC) is through remote collaborative real-time combined CAD\/JACK\/DELMIA modeling, such as the work done by the KSC Human Engineering Modeling and Performance (HEMAP) lab. If a staggered serial approach for development is taken, ensure that a stable configuration is available before the CDR. Allow portions of the design that show low risk of rework to proceed to fabrication. But do not allow portions of the design that show a high risk of rework to proceed to fabrication until the risk of rework is reduced. As the vehicle is being developed (prior to CDR), integrate key people from the Ground Systems team into the Flight Systems IPT in order to flag potential problems.","Lesson ID":5200}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Evaluate resources needed for full-scale mock-ups, use the mock-ups as quickly as possible to resolve integration issues, and identify an appropriate time to begin ground operations mock-up work.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Develop a comprehensive set of supportability requirements in Program level requirements documentation, and flow down to each major system. During the design phase, supportability performance requirements can be traded against other performance requirements of the system. The Program will have a more accurate picture of life-cycle costs that are traded for system performance.","Lesson ID":5061}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Ensure Design Supportability Requirements are in Ground Systems Requirements documentation and flowed down to influence system designs. This can be accomplished by having the Logistics Engineers be a part of the SE&I organization.

{"Recommendation(s)":"For future liquid engine and feed system designs where purging of liquid hydrogen engine feed systems are required, design using one of these options: Purge the line with a commodity the engines can ingest (gaseous hydrogen) (Alternative Design Solution), or Certify the engines for the potential ingestion of this commodity (helium) (Validation of Design; Certification) or Turn on the purge after the outboard Fill and Drain (F&D) valve closes to eliminate the possibility of ingesting the unwanted substance. (Operational Sequence modification) Some of the above recommendations are an operational process change based on the design configuration of this specific system. The principles of this lesson should be applied to any design regardless of configuration.)","Lesson ID":6142}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Changes to electrical systems should be reviewed for failure modes other than strictly \u201celectrical\u201d causes; mechanical response of sensors to extreme environments is a broadly applicable area of concern in system design at NASA. Operating environments and their potential effects on materials and mechanisms should be identified and mitigated as early in the design process or the design change process so that the problem is not first detected when the vehicle is sitting on the launch pad. Operational check-out procedures could be reviewed to determine if changes to check-out sequences could identify potential problems prior to a launch attempt. The information learned from the Centaur Program should have been communicated to the vendor or to some industry wide bulletin board. The vendor then should have taken responsibility to notify other users of the product of the potential problem that may exist in their application if used in similar conditions, and of any corrections or fixes to the problem. The process could be similar to a Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) alert or an information bulletin from an automobile manufacturer about a potential defect.

{"Recommendation(s)":"A wireless \u2018smart\u2019 hazardous gas leak detection system has been developed where miniature leak detectors can be mounted anywhere a detector is required. The signal from these detectors can be sent wirelessly to a central monitor. From here the output can be transmitted to the ground for real-time monitoring of any potential leaks in the aft compartment during ascent.

{"Recommendation(s)":"For all future NASA launch vehicles, that are human rated, it is mandatory that a pogo stability analysis be conducted to ensure that the vehicle is pogo free during all phases of powered flight. If the analysis indicates that the launch vehicle has a propensity to pogo, then a pogo suppressor shall be included in the base line design for the launch vehicle propulsion system.","Lesson ID":6356}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Ensure assembly drawings and process plans contain complete, clear, and detailed instructions. More than one technician should be capable of performing the required assembly processes. Implement post assembly 60deg C, 8 hour bake-out step prior to use. Use ethyl alcohol for post solder cleaning and do not wipe cable with alcohol after bake-out. When handling and installing SpaceWire cable, never bend the cable with a bend radius smaller than 4\u201d, 6\u201d is preferred. This recommendation is from engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center who have experience working with this cable on several flight programs. Also note this bend radius is larger than what the manufacturer and SpaceWire Specification (ECSS-E-ST-50-12C) specify. Wrap cable with two wrappings of 200A STRIP-N-STICK (Auburn Manufacturing Company) or similar foam material where tie wraps secure cable. Hand install tie wraps, they should be snug but not tight against the foam material. When installing cables in flight hardware, position and secured the SpaceWire cables in place one time and never unbend them. These cables should be installed as close to the final item as possible to minimize potential damage. Investigate alternative cables for SpaceWire use. Any 100 ohm characteristic impedance cable designed for a Low Voltage Differential Signals (LVDS) should work. Cable must also meet program material requirements. Investigate possibility of obtaining Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) equipment that can test cables less than 10 ft for use at GRC. If this is not possible, continue to utilize the Naval Research Laboratory to perform this test when required. When working with a new cable\/connector system with no previous experience, contact other NASA users for information on problems they may have experienced. Include a face view of the connector in the assembly drawing when orientation is important.","Lesson ID":6416}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The initial response to the JPL-wide power outage needs to be augmented with process changes that address the significant potential impacts on personnel, flight assets, and JPL activities: For critical facilities with dedicated backup power generators, conduct periodic testing of the automatic switchover from facility power. Periodically assess whether backup generators, UPS systems, and air conditioning need to be upgraded. Place exit signs and emergency lighting inverters and batteries on a monthly and annual inspection and test schedule. The inspection of the exit signs and emergency lighting should assess compliance with Reference (2). Revise the JPL Multi-Hazard Emergency Response Plan (MERP) to cover generic unscheduled power outages. Update the Everbridge notification tool to include timely notification of JPL senior management of all incidents where there is a potential impact to personnel safety or Lab-wide operations. At least once per month, update JPL Protective Services on changes to the CHAPHS user list to ensure that the CHAPHS point-of-contact information used by Everbridge is current. Assure that the JPL Fire Department is trained and equipped to perform emergency extractions on all JPL elevators. Assure that facility contracts do not inhibit emergency response.","Lesson ID":6396}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Whenever serial or continuous procedures are repeatedly used they should include a provision to periodically review them against their baseline versions. Where possible, the assumptions of the baseline procedure that conceivably could lead to future risk should be included with the procedure. The intent is to avoid a practice that \u2018worked\u2019 from becoming the new standard without any particular analysis of the new configuration of use. When the operational environments or process applications change a review of procedural assumptions should be conducted to look for application specific assumptions that may not be valid in the new use configuration.","Lesson ID":6256}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Clearly define the roles and responsibilities during the planning phase. Identify one contractor to perform both O&M and sustaining engineering for similar systems at various locations. Ensure processes and reporting methods are in place to account for complex contracting relationships.","Lesson ID":3636}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Utilize mass spectrometer leak checks for critical systems where even small external leakages can have serious consequences. Ensure procedures are correct, detailed and followed. Maintain equipment in calibration. Perform pretest and post-test checks of the equipment when performing leak checks. Ensure operations are properly trained and that they have a good working knowledge of the equipment and how to use it.","Lesson ID":4256}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Design FCPs for future launch vehicles so that they minimize the need for electrical power by using passive cooling and water removal methods, if possible. As an alternative, have the FCP draw the electrical power it needs to operate directly from the power it is generating instead of drawing it from the spacecraft\u2019s electrical bus. This could be done either by using DC pumps or by providing inverters on the FCPs to convert the parasitic power from DC to AC.","Lesson ID":4056}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When performing leak checks of components in semi closed or closed cavities consider using this type of leak check. If the component interface is purged during operations and is sampled by a Hazardous Gas Detection System mass spec to provide real time data on the health of the component\/interface during operations then try and use the already existing purge and sampling capabilities to perform the leak checks.","Lesson ID":4218}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Be very careful to not only assure that heritage hardware is to be used in a similar or less demanding space environment, but also assure that adequate testing is done to assure operation over the range of environments that may be encountered including off-nominal environments. Also, be careful not to accept as legitimate heritage hardware any subsystem that has been developed for another mission that has not yet flown.","Lesson ID":2298}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Understand the critical analytical software to be used for fabrication\/testing of high cost\/long lead item hardware. Perform independent reviews of the software to be reused and document the software interfaces. For large programs, formal software development requirements should be levied on both the reused elements and new software elements, through the use of formal software development, integration, testing, and configuration management methodologies.","Lesson ID":2158}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For reusable spacecraft, nut plates should be designed for frequent use; and if a secondary locking feature is required, place the locking feature on the bolt rather than on the insert or nut plate. Nylon-style locking features such as Vespel should be avoided.","Lesson ID":3259}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The CogE for the flight hardware under test is fully responsible for planning and conducting the test, including lift operations. The CogE should assure that: The JPL Assembly and Inspection Data Sheet (AIDS) or procedures for the lift always list a step for verifying and recording the expected load cell reading. Pre-lift briefings always contain a communication of the expected maximum load cell reading and identification of any expected hardware close approaches. Also, conduct an inspection of the test setup by the lift team to familiarize these personnel with the hardware and lift sequence. When load cells cannot be used, the CogE employs and communicates alternative processes to ensure hardware safety is not compromised. Instead of placing total reliance on computer-aided design (CAD) drawings to identify interference points or close approaches that may be manifested during lift operations: It is always prudent to perform a fit or rotation check prior to engaging critical hardware (flight hardware or GSE). Assign an individual throughout the lift operation to observe the load cell and call out the numbers to assure that the expected load is not exceeded. During this time, the CogE should perform a very active role, calling out \u201clift and hold, lift and hold\u201d while moving around the test article and verbalizing possible anomalies. Center-wide training classes should be held periodically to train JPL CogEs in conducting lift operations, covering such topics as mandatory lift procedures and lessons learned, participant qualifications and responsibilities, system safety and personnel safety practices, Center points-of-contact, etc.","Lesson ID":6216}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Contractors should institute a process to verify the correctness of data contained in lift plans. NASA should review current requirements relating to extent of oversight \/ depth of insight to determine if either should be adjusted to the degree required to detect a similar mistake. Contractors should institute a process to verify actual loads on-site","Lesson ID":5836}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Support thorough thought processes in identifying the core requirements during the design stage. Provide a process for recommending continuous improvements for any design. Document work processes. Be persistent in pursuing funding for operationally beneficial design changes","Lesson ID":6116}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Involve affected stakeholders in the initial development of top-level requirements that drive program architectures. Weigh the achievement of capability in the near term against the available schedule and budget. Consider taking a phased approach to reach the desired end-state capability instead of attempting to achieve the full capability up front (e.g., consider the originally proposed Spiral Development approach or a Building-Block approach.)","Lesson ID":5163}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When incorporating metal bellows flex hoses into a system design ( ground support equipment or flight ) it is important to test the hoses before each use on the ground or in flight if it is difficult to determine how much reverse bending flexure the hose is being subjected to. It is also important to have a more rigorous inspection program for these hoses and to provide protection for the hoses during ground processing whenever possible. Cost should also be factored in for a more frequent replacement interval for the hoses to avoid failures especially in critical or hazardous systems.","Lesson ID":5479}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Include all stakeholders (customers, operations, design\/implementing organization, and users) in the initial selection of the verification method. Throughout the design life cycle, reevaluate the methods originally selected to confirm they remain valid as the design matures. By formally addressing verification methods at each design review, the implementing organization will ensure it can execute the chosen methods.","Lesson ID":5203}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Perform PQV to verify the peer-reviewed packaging design for all critical RTD applications used in both closed and open \"control loops.\" Develop a set of standard, flight qualified, mounting configurations, installation procedures, and workmanship standards for RTDs not intended for critical applications. Review the established engineering specifications and procedures on the use of bonding and potting compounds, and issue guidelines that account for adhesive properties, the need for mechanical stress relief, and the effects of environmental stress on RTDs. Assure that all piece part RTDs have a qualification paper trail from the manufacturer.","Lesson ID":1581}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Contractor employees receive periodic training in the hazards associated with climbing fixed ladders and procedures to minimize the associated hazards, including the use of hoisting equipment. Contractor provide employees with more comprehensive training on the proper use of PPE during the application of Molykote. Remove all non-compliant MLP Pedestal fixed ladders on LC-39A, LC-39B, MLP Park Site, and the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) from service (tagged out), and permanently remove from pedestals. Install protective covers on MLP Pedestal upper boss and upper spherical yoke.","Lesson ID":5916}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Require system reviews be conducted after major contract changes to ensure all required inspection and maintenance activities are scheduled in accordance with NASA, NFPA and manufacturer requirements. Create a process to periodically review contractor compliance with NASA, NFPA, and manufacturer requirements for inspection and maintenance of critical fire suppression system components. Create a process to periodically review monitoring requirements of the Firex system and pumps. Contractor personnel monitor PRV discharge pressure when pumps are operating. Install an alarm system in the VAB Utility Annex to warn diesel pump operators of an over-pressure condition. Monitor Firex system pressure in the LCC with an alarm on the KCCS water console. If the alarm activates, personnel can direct diesel-driven pump operators to shut the pumps down and isolate the LCC from the VAB Firex supply loop. Require pump operators to be in direct communication with SPOC personnel on the KCCS water console while operating the pumps. For future fire suppression system installations, at the beginning of the construction project, contractors should be briefed on the importance of following contract requirements for installation of the fire suppression systems, including manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The entire VAB \/ LCC fire suppression system should be reviewed to identify single failure points in all stages of operation.","Lesson ID":5936}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Following the incident, JPL Safety and the JPL ATLO (Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations) Mechanical Team reviewed JPL lift processes and made the following recommendations for improvement (Reference (3)): When releasing\/disconnecting the load during a crane lift, utilize a Hydra Set to establish sufficient slack for the rigging to be disconnected, or for 3-5 seconds of movement at the highest crane speed in the wrong direction. This will provide sufficient time to execute an emergency stop. When mating\/raising a load, utilize a Hydra Set beyond the point where there is 3-5 seconds of movement available at the highest crane speed. This will provide sufficient time to execute an emergency stop. When a Hydra Set is not available or the Hydra Set functionality is lost, the Lift Lead should use limited movements or \u2018bump commands\u2019 for the activities described above. Ensure an unencumbered individual is available to monitor the load cell during lifts.","Lesson ID":5796}

{"Recommendation(s)":"**TEST AS YOU FLY, FLY AS YOU TEST** Would strongly recommend future LO2 based engine programs implement a method to sample LO2 purity in-line\/in-run during engine acceptance testing to establish a baseline. Would recommend future programs maintain a preflight measurement capability of LO2 purity to ensure adequate performance during flight. Would recommend implementing LO2 purity requirements for both test and flight that are compatible and correct for any differences in pre-flight predictions. Would recommend not pressurizing LO2 run tanks at SSC with GN2, this only worsens the purity of the LO2 in the stand. Instead consider pressurizing with GO2.","Lesson ID":6056}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For any new space vehicle program, where redundant power is provided to the space vehicle\u2019s critical LRUs, the capability to automatically detect and verify the bus redundancy should be designed into the system. A system similar to the Orbiter\u2019s \u201cCaution and Warning\u201d panel could be used to monitor the bus redundancy status of all critical functions. This would allow for automatically verifying bus redundancy whenever power is applied to the space vehicle and for monitoring the status throughout launch processing and mission operations.","Lesson ID":3761}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A uniform methodology for the installation of all fasteners should be provided early in the design phase of the program. This fastener specification should be imposed on all vendors\/contractors responsible for hardware assemblies on the space vehicle. Where applicable, locking threads with running torques and final torques should be imposed on all assembly drawings. Additionally, the Shuttle Orbiter hatch actuators are essentially multi-geared torque multipliers containing numerous small parts which cannot be easily maintained. Despite several successful ground cycles of the hatch actuator, the problem was not identified until flight, and was not repairable in-flight. Future designed should give serious consideration to less elegant designs. Designs with less complexity, lower parts count, and the ability for in-flight maintenance, in-flight repair or in-flight work-around should be given a higher priority in design trade studies. It is easy to design something more complicated with added features and additional failure modes, but more difficult to build it to be simple and robust with fewer failure modes; future designers should strive for the latter.","Lesson ID":4417}
{"Recommendation(s)":"In the future, either develop a sensor that is not subject to distortions caused by other equipment or provide a dedicated source of electrical power to the equipment being monitored.","Lesson ID":4057}

{"Recommendation(s)":"In the future, during the initial design phase for spacecraft that will utilize FCPs, determine if there exist FCPs that can meet design requirements if propellant grade reactants are used. If so, then perform a trade study to determine whether the advantages of doing so warrant such a design.","Lesson ID":4058}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Construction Contractors should implement formal procedures, actions, or controls to ensure and verify that the workers are clear of crates, moving loads, and any potential falling hazards before moving any crates. Contractor personnel should completely remove all tarps and tie-down straps from trucks and flatbed trailers prior to unloading crates, materials, equipment, etc. Contractor personnel should check that loads are clear on all sides (to the maximum extent possible) before removing them from trucks and flatbed trailers. Contractors should consider and implement alternative methods of unloading equipment and materials to reduce risk to workers.","Lesson ID":5879}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Contractors should not start demolition work until utility disconnection and isolation have been completed and verified in writing. Do not demolish any electrical equipment until it has been de-energized completely, disconnected at all possible sources, and verified de-energized at the equipment with the proper electrical test equipment. The contractor's pre-task briefings should reinforce that all signs are applicable. Signs that are not applicable should be visually defaced or removed. Signs addressing hazards on the site should be reviewed and updated as necessary. Prior to demolition, contractors should not remove barriers and warning signs until an outage is performed and power is verified safe and isolated. Contractors should install barricades, signs, and flags around live electrical equipment and\/or potential hazardous conditions on demolition sites. Contractors should remove signs when hazards no longer exist and replace when the hazards return.","Lesson ID":5876}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Contractors should always be encouraged that working safely is more important than finishing early. This should be discussed in each and every safety meeting to reinforce Safety First. All operators must be aware of manufacturer's O&M instructions and not exceed machine safety guidelines as listed in operating instructions. Operators must be trained and aware of the operating capabilities and capacities of equipment being operated. The load should remain close to the machine when traveling any distances. Lifting capacity decreases as the load is moved further from the machine. For more recommendations view Mishap Report.","Lesson ID":5896}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Contractor Transportation should increase front-line management surveillance of drivers and transportation leads to ensure safe handling of cargo. Contractor Transportation should ensure that drivers and transportation leads are aware that cargo can shift when placed against the headboard of a truck, and recommend appropriate tie-down methods. Contractor Transportation should provide a method for drivers to easily access truck beds (e.g., portable ladder). Contractor Transportation should study the feasibility and benefit of providing regular refresher training on Florida Commercial Driver License Handbook regulations. For more recommendations view Mishap Report.","Lesson ID":5897}
{"Recommendation(s)":"From the Astor E-2 MIB: To promote success in collaborations with Japan or other international organizations, NASA should form a high-level team to work directly with that organization to create a general framework for the management and system engineering of joint programs. This framework would define an organizational structure with clear roles and responsibilities, and required joint working groups in system engineering, integration, test, and operations. Specific areas of clarification should include but not be limited to: conduct of project reviews; management of review action items; and shared change management, requirements, test, and operations. To promote success in international collaborations, NASA should include a specific budget line item for international missions that recognizes and quantifies the cost of collaboration and build these cost estimates into the budget. This line item should include, but not be limited to: travel, in-plant representatives, translators, CM system management, and additional schedule requirements. To promote mission success in international collaborations, NASA must actively participate in spacecraft-level system engineering and spacecraft-level system reviews. Reviews must be conducted in a common language or translated simultaneously. To promote mission success in instances in which NASA chooses to reuse a design (that is, build-to-print) that has not operated in space and met its design goals, NASA must conduct the formulation, design reviews, tests, integration, and operation as if it were a new design. The management team must approach development with the attitude that the previous design may still have major deficiencies. An independent team chartered to discover deficiencies in the original program must review all verification and test procedures. To minimize surprises during mission operations and to maximize operational efficiency and safety, all projects should have pre-launch rehearsals for initialization activities and other important operations to ensure that no mission-critical activity is performed in flight without prior test or analysis. Any irreversible operation must be considered mission critical (see LL#2116 for a related lesson).","Lesson ID":5776}

Allocate resources to convert data to the correct format, if necessary. Adequately instrument the flight and GSE systems using low-cost (and where possible, noninvasive) maintenance parameters in conjunction with the flight-critical measurements. Consider math modeling requirements when determining locations for the maintenance-level instrumentation. Design and populate the attributes of the model based on real data as it is generated.","Lesson ID":4216}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Consider using a lower-cost, minimally intrusive maintenance instrumentation suite in future vehicle and GSE configurations to generate subsystem performance data in areas of the systems where OFI or operational GSE instrumentation is not needed. Since this system would not need to be as reliable or accurate as the instrumentation used to verify flight-critical requirements, such as the current Launch Commit Criteria (LCC), this instrumentation would have lower costs related to redundancy, intrusiveness, and maintenance.","Lesson ID":4217}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Teach the principles of a fall-protection system, including the primary\/secondary fall protection concept. Clarify that guardrails and chains should not be the primary method of fall protection. Emphasize do not lean on guardrails or chains. Ensure crisp and unambiguous Sustaining Engineering roles and responsibilities. Every guardrail and chain should be under the control of a configuration authority.

An air-conditioned operating environment would also have a reduced humidity and a lower salt content, thus reducing the corrosive elements encountered by the panels. Operational cost and environmental consideration should be reflected in life-cycle analysis during early design phases.","Lesson ID":3297}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Ensure the inventory of pressure vessels is known, that the certification of these vessels is in accordance with your safety requirements, and that your pressure vessel safety requirements are clear, concise, and comprehensive. Ensure that modifications to pressure systems are managed and controlled by configuration management in order to ensure that safety is not compromised regardless of ownership at the Center. All pressure system maintenance should be performed by approved procedures that ensure configuration control, including the use and approval of parts that are not from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Ensure that modifications to Commerical Off The Shelf (COTS) equipment goes through an approval by the manufacturer and\/or an approval by the Center\u2019s safety engineering organization. Also, a documented process to should be developed and followed. Ensure that daily safety inspections are performed and that those records are maintained. Ensure that field maintenance is performed by the responsible equipment owner in accordance with manufacturer requirements. All KSC prime contractors who manage PV\/S at KSC should explicitly identify in their subcontracts the maintenance that subcontractors are authorized to perform without obtaining prime-contractor approval.","Lesson ID":5156}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The Station Fire provided an opportunity to test JPL disaster response preparations and identify weaknesses. Based on a review of the incident and interviews with key personnel that were involved, Reference (1) provides four principal recommendations for improving the functioning of teams and operations centers: Improve or enhance the performance of the EOC team and the EOC physical location: Revisit the JPL Emergency Response Plan in light of the lessons learned, including clearly defining the initial emergency assessment process, defining the process for an EOC shift change, and refining the roles and responsibilities of the EOC, MOC, and the teams. Provide team training and logistic support, including adequate staffing for key positions, for sustained operations. Improve EOC tools, including developing a tracking system for all incoming messages; developing a written EOC Incident Action Plan (IAP) for each operational period; and stocking special supplies such as satellite radios, battery powered TVs, direct outside landlines, and portable HEPA filters. Assess the adequacy of the EOC to meet future emergency response needs, including facility location, size, configuration, and equipment colocation. Enhance and improve emergency communications (e.g., processes, equipment, directories, communications templates, use of social media) for use within the EOC and for communicating to outside stakeholders and the external media. Improve field response performance and safety: Enhance field response support (i.e., logistic support, field communications, on-Lab reporting and tracking, provision of safety officer position) for all field responders including fire, safety, facilities, and USAR. USAR team improvements, including a plan and logistic support for sustained operations, pre-determined meeting locations, evaluation of personal protective equipment and specialized USAR equipment, review of check-in and check-out procedures, and assessment of team training based on the fire experience. Clarify the definition of quotmission-critical personnel,quot and communicate to staff which personnel are mission-critical. Empower the staff who must be present during emergencies, and develop Human Resource policies for the staff who may not be working during the incident. Develop an on-going fire prevention and mitigation planning program, including such ongoing fire prevention measures as roof and gutter cleaning, and review of fire suppression products. Reference (2) tracks JPL progress in implementing the recommendations of Reference (1). Emergency response measures are also captured in Reference (3).","Lesson ID":5256}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The application of periodic high rate charge pulses (between C\/10 and C\/4) was observed to be effective in at least temporarily stemming the continued voltage degradation of the WMAP battery and in a similar laboratory test battery. Careful consideration to avoid high temperatures (above +10\u00b0C) needed to be in place to reduce the possibility of thermal runaway.","Lesson ID":5336}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Safety and environmental systems and controls need careful evaluation during design. Because safety and environmental regulations continue to get more stringent, a flexible and thoroughly tested design could save costly modifications later. Hypergolic propellants pose a hazard to personnel and the environment and can also be tough on hardware. Compatibility and long-term effects can have significant impacts on safety as well as cost at a later time. System design and maintenance planning call for the evaluation of long-term impacts and degradation.","Lesson ID":3596}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Valves that do not perform a NASA-required valve function should be physically disabled. Valves that do not perform a NASA-required valve function should not be incorporated into larger designs and should not be included in procurement specifications. KSC project teams should review procurement specifications for prototypes more closely to ensure that KSC requirements, including those for hazardproofing and electrical design, are part of the procurement specification. Engineering Review Boards reviewing requests to use prototypes should assign a single, dedicated point of contact to be responsible for verifying the prototype's compliance with design requirements (mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, reliability, etc.) for use at KSC and to request any warranted waivers. A formal approved procedure should be in place for the operation of a prototype after design verification. An approved user training course should be in place for prototype operation procedures after design verification. All hardware, whether COTS or prototype, used in proximity of a space vehicle requires the performance of all design, operation, and training verification procedures.","Lesson ID":4456}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Ensure a process is followed for independent reviews of non-routine hazardous test operations and that the appropriate NASA disciplines evaluate these tests. Establish a Centerwide process to ensure the necessary oversight is provided for hazardous operations at the various laboratories and test facilities at KSC. Provide the NASA\/KSC directorates and contractors with clear Point-of-Contact information pertaining to the necessary NASA disciplines required for review. Ensure adequate internal and external oversight in accordance with contractual requirements. Fulfill the Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) contractual obligations pertaining to safety, risk management, and pressure vessel system review. NASA Safety should perform periodic reviews to verify contractual obligations pertaining to safety, risk management, and pressure vessel system are met.","Lesson ID":4976}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When designing new spacecraft systems, provide lifting and alignment aids for all heavy structural components that are designed to be removed and replaced at any time in the processing flow. This will greatly facilitate the installation and removal process and reduce the damage to the spacecraft structure and attachment holes.","Lesson ID":3557}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Implementing a method to review product designs as well as internal processes of vendors supplying products for use in Ground Support Equipment (GSE) will provide the required oversight for these critical systems. This is especially important if contracting vendors are changed between, or during the development, of first articles, production, and eventual sustaining engineering.","Lesson ID":3041}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The use of canned pumps is not recommended for hypergolic operations. The use of the pumped commodity as a cooling agent circulating between the rotor and stator of an electric motor is the primary reason for classifying the pumps as critical components. Magnetic-drive pumps are recommended for this application. This would reduce if not eliminate the stringent requirements for this pump.","Lesson ID":3576}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For long-term programs, where the intermediate and depot maintenance plan is to return failed mechanical LRUs to the OEM, a plan B should be provided to allow for transfer of the maintenance document to the site where the space vehicle is processed. Funding and contract requirements should be established for the OEMs to provide maintenance documentation with or before the delivery of all major mechanical hardware on the program.","Lesson ID":3558}
{"Recommendation(s)":"As early as possible in the planning stages of a software project, perform an analysis to determine what measures or metrics will used to identify the \u201chealth\u201d or hindrances (risks) to the project. Because collection and analysis of metrics require additional resources, select measures that are tailored and applicable to the unique characteristics of the software project, and use them only if efficiencies in the project can be realized as a result. The following are examples of useful metrics: The number of software requirement changes (added\/deleted\/modified) during each phase of the software process (e.g., design, development, testing) The number of errors found during software verification\/validation The number of errors found in delivered software (a.k.a., \u201cprocess escapes\u201d) Projected versus actual labor hours expended Projected versus actual lines of code, and the number of function points in delivered software. Software development estimation tools may also be used (e.g., COCOMO II).","Lesson ID":3556}

{"Recommendation(s)":"It was determined that the air-cooled avionics LRUs needed more a rigorous inspection and cleaning maintenance than they had been getting before the GPC anomaly. The maintenance requirements were changed so there would be closer inspection (including removal of the air-inlet screens) and cleaning of the cooling inlets. Now, the avionics bay and flight deck avionics are inspected and cleaned just prior to bay final closeouts for each flight, or after 2,000 hours of air circulation (whichever is less).

{"Recommendation(s)":"For new spacecraft systems design and development, it is critical that a worst-case scenario evaluation be performed on critical flight systems so that health status is available at the level required to determine the system\u2019s health. This health and status must be provided via downlink to ground systems support personnel.","Lesson ID":3339}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Include standard questions on field changes in weekly Facility Operating Services (FOS) construction notes. Test all drains per existing specifications to ensure they are functional. Evaluate drains, close and remove inactive ones. Conduct thorough inspection of all roof drains per specifications, including areas covered by drop ceiling tiles when drain pipes are internal to the building.","Lesson ID":4236}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Do not return an electronic part or assembly to the anti-static bag or envelope from which the item, or another item, was withdrawn. Dispose of the original bag, and use a new anti-static bag.","Lesson ID":4176}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Future hardware processing systems should allow engineers to identify which procedure must be worked before others.","Lesson ID":3338}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When it is only feasible to test \"last minute\" command changes or flight software changes via simulation, instead of using the flight system that has been integrated with the launch vehicle, assure that the simulation testbed is capable of end-to-end verification of the impact on all flight software functions, including fault protection. Should the system testbed lack high fidelity features such as dual string simulation, the project should identify potential testing shortfalls and address how it will validate the test results.","Lesson ID":3716}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Training and constant awareness on the part of the technicians are essential to achieve proper and consistent fastener installation. Accurate measurement of the grip length every time is critical to the proper installation of fasteners. This operation can seem simple and even inconsequential, so it can easily be taken for granted.","Lesson ID":3260}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Remove batteries from current placement (attached to generator rail) to eliminate vibration (potential causal factor) and place on floor easily accessible to technicians and vendors Contact service vendor and request a formal report pertaining to any historical trends (battery faults) with like Generator equipment as used at this facility Preventative maintenance schedules will include increased checks and be documented Any affiliated equipment (battery chargers) will be re-evaluated to assure that the system is operating in a efficient manner and that the startup batteries are monitored effectively to ensure adequate readings for technicians Check to determine if there is any Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) notice out there on our batteries or chargers. Continue to properly maintain batteries, ensuring that battery charge rates are set properly, electrolyte levels are correct, battery caps are properly vented and maintenance is only performed by trained professional and battery charger should be off while performing maintenance. Place appropriate signage on the entrance way to warn personnel entering the facility of the hazard Ensure appropriate barriers (recommend battery containment are purchased and\/or constructed to prevent personnel exposure to battery faults for all generators","Lesson ID":2876}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Where warranted by the severity of the potential hazards, augment the pre-operational safety review (OSR) for a test facility with a hazard assessment specific to the type of test article (i.e., battery type) and type of test. (See Reference (5)). Assess risk and communicate the risk posture to line management. Battery testing and storage procedures and processes must assure the safety of personnel, facilities, and hardware, and conform to safety standards. (See Reference (6).) Verify EGSE (battery charger, controller, etc.) has appropriate fault protection in place, and demonstrate that it operates as specified to bring the test to a safe condition. Reassess building ventilation system intakes in proximity to the exhaust from co-located or nearby laboratories that handle or store hazardous materials. (See Reference (7).) NASA flight projects that wish to use such Li-ion batteries should consider test configuration improvements: Verify the operation of redundant voltage taps. (Redundant voltage taps are not provided on workhorse batteries. More important, test engineers should recognize when equipment becomes faulty and remove it from test until the equipment is repaired or replaced.) Verify the as-built battery thermal conductance implementation. (Not a feature on the involved workhorse battery. Test engineers should recognize that thermal management is a consideration in future testing and account for it with appropriate test setup design\/ventilation provisions.) Review the implementation of battery charge and conditioning management, including worst case thermal environments, faulty charge equipment, and faulty sensors. Conduct a hazards assessment that addresses worst-case events occurring throughout the entire battery charge\/discharge cycle, and verifies that appropriate mitigation measures are in place for each worst-case event.","Lesson ID":3516}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Perform a review of test history, maintenance performed, operation history, and design safety to determine the optimum maintenance requirements.","Lesson ID":3197}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Determining the limits for this type of requirement would be difficult to do before the hardware is built because of the lack of information on the external environment and the actual effect the purge would have on the hardware being protected. However, a placeholder for a general requirement could be put in place. At some point, a completed pathfinder spacecraft will be built and actual testing could be performed using temporary surface temperature sensors and humidity sensors to determine the effects of a purge outage or temperature\/humidity excursion on the spacecraft.","Lesson ID":3157}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Use load-sensing pins at critical connection points to indicate loading and load changes as opposed to relying totally on feel or sight. Include load limits in the written operating procedure to protect the hardware.","Lesson ID":3116}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Plan ahead. The WISE project decision to start planning the detailed launch campaign operations more than a year before launch proved essential. Mitigate launch-on-time risks through adequate staffing and training of the on-site team, practicing countdown procedures, and planning and exercising responses to anomalous events. Manage uncertainty by placing resources in readiness well ahead of the scheduled operational need, with backup plans and resources to meet contingencies. Provide a dedicated staff prepared to respond to last-minute logistic challenges. Identify key Center engineering specialists whose input may be needed to validate payload safety-related technical decisions advocated by resident launch support personnel. Recognize the different engineering culture and practices of launch site personnel, but verify their evaluation of launch risks. Maintain daily communication with all launch site personnel across the contributing organizations, communicating key decisions and dispelling rumors. Alleviate the increasing level of anxiety that accompanies the diminishing countdown by ensuring professionalism and providing backups for key positions.","Lesson ID":3496}
{"Recommendation(s)":"At the end of the Space Shuttle program, a modified version of the original test was used to leak-check the SSMEs before they were installed in the orbiter. A test such as the Helium Signature Test can be used for any enclosed hazardous system with a control volume to ensure overall system integrity before the hazardous medium is introduced.","Lesson ID":3177}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Establish an extensive requirement for photo documentation. All key processing points should be photographed. Photo resolution should be specified by minimum pixel count. Figure 2: Document describing closeout photo requirements","Lesson ID":3202}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Space flight system design should take into account the possibility of hardware failure rates that are higher than that of the expected design life cycle, as well as the possibility of future requirements which may drive the removal of components for interim processing. System design which incorporates the use of Dynatube fittings should also account for human factors in accessing such components, especially when internal hazards are present which require the use of special personal protective equipment which limits dexterity . In cases where access is difficult, the use of flexible lines, such as those incorporated in the Forward Reaction Control System should be taken into consideration.","Lesson ID":3220}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The need to re-qualify an inherited spacecraft subsystem design for application on a new mission is widely recognized, but careful consideration should be given to the need to re-qualify the capabilities of the subsystem contractor: For development of a subsystem that is dependent on novel technology, persevere in devising an incentive-based contract acceptable to both parties. When inheriting a subsystem design that has not been built for many years, consider verifying manufacturability by fabricating a qualification model. When inheriting a design for a build-to-print, ensure that all of the essential resources are actually available to be inherited-- drawings, tooling, fabrication procedures, models, personnel, etc. Assess whether the contractor has the management stability and dedication to the project needed to meet contract commitments. Place a priority on ensuring that TRDs, MICDs, and ICDs are completed and released in time for the technical reviews that require the documents. The NASA Center should provide all of the supplementary hardware attached to the Center-provided components to be delivered for integration and test (I&T). To mitigate I&T problems with controlling a complex subsystem interface, assure that the spacecraft contractor provides a dedicated individual (see Reference (4)) to oversee the spacecraft side of the interface. Exercise great care in the identification and elimination, where possible, of test-as-you-fly exceptions.","Lesson ID":3396}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Organize and fund science planning operations to maximize science return where such return is constrained by mission complexity arising from the hardware, software, or MOS design. Carefully consider the potential impact upon mission operations of cost savings decisions affecting the development of spacecraft and ground systems. Recognize that trade-offs in system design may necessitate added ops complexity, cost, and risk if mission objectives are to be achieved. The development of operational scenarios is important to support pre-launch cost saving decisions, both spacecraft and ground. Prior to the launch, prepare and validate a system to manage constrained spacecraft resources such as pointing, data volume, and operational power. For example, the data volume stored on the Solid State Recorder could only be cleared during the 9 hours out of 24 when the Cassini spacecraft was earth-pointed. The lack of resource margins for science return will require compensatory staffing during flight operations. Although MOS development may not be completed until after launch, it should attain a maturity sufficient to support key ops activities well before those activities commence. The ground system architecture and design, requirements, ops concepts, and interfaces must be mature before launch. Science planning, including the organization of science and engineering activities and the allocation of shared spacecraft resources, is essential to managing the delays and conflicts in detailed command sequence development that arise from geographically distributed ops. The use of distributed science operations makes the most sense for systems that are relatively non-interactive.","Lesson ID":3436}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Perform procedural verifications against software models prior to executing against hardware. Increase console team\u2019s training. Heightened awareness of software controls.","Lesson ID":2816}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A COTS implementation would have been a better solution for a data acquisition and instrumentation replacement project. With a mature system in place and operating reliably, there was plenty of time to evaluate needs and requirements with the user. The need for a new system was not urgent. Data acquisition and instrumentation manufacturers are generally focused on their product, are dedicated to continual improvement, have resources available to support design changes, and promptly respond to system problems. The use of COTS when possible can lead to a better, more mature design that has been extensively tested and comes with available technical support.","Lesson ID":2956}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A white paper study should be performed to determine the best strategy for leak detection in ground system pneumatics, and the findings should be incorporated into upgraded pneumatic systems in the future. New designs or upgrades to the KSC pneumatic systems should incorporate a strategy for detection and quick isolation of gas leakages.","Lesson ID":2976}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Future systems would benefit from adopting this same approach to processing. One central database can be used for a reference file, loaded with all the information needed to properly process (remove, inspect, store, recall, install) each part.","Lesson ID":3016}
{"Recommendation(s)":"New LRU designs need to provide an Integrated Built In Test that will verify the LRU internal components and external outputs of the LRU are functioning nominally. The IBIT test should able to be initiated and pass\/fail results reported by ground or flight software.","Lesson ID":2916}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Individual wire identification should be used on space flight vehicles.","Lesson ID":2917}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The design of the mechanical system should be robust enough that tolerances of +\/- 0.001 inch are not required. Verification that the system is adjusted properly should be able to be performed using standard tools\/equipment (feeler gauges, micrometers, calipers, etc.). For critical settings requiring a high level of accuracy, specialized tooling or equipment should be developed to reduce the likelihood of adjustment or measurement error by the personnel rigging the mechanism. Additionally, during the design process and development of the specifications, all possible ground and flight environments need to be considered. This is especially important if ground testing will not screen for potential flight-environment-induced problems.","Lesson ID":2837}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Keep abreast of community updates to the maintenance recommendations for similar items and incorporate changes to maintenance procedures as required. Watch for modifications that increase the safety and operability of equipment.","Lesson ID":2896}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Maintain an integrated overall systems perspective so that build up of individual parts work as designed particularly in view of modifications and rework.","Lesson ID":2716}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When modifications are made on interfaces between elements, in-depth investigation of the operational conditions present at the interface should be performed. Before modifications to major interface components and recertification can be considered complete, interfaces should be tested as integrated systems, and where possible, the tests should replicate operational conditions.","Lesson ID":2856}
{"Recommendation(s)":"During the design process, it is important that all the loads be fully understood and considered. It appears that the loads created by compression of the soft goods were underestimated during the design of the landing gear door system. Specifications for the mechanical systems should address field rigging of the components postdelivery. These may be separate specs or sections within the original installation and rigging specifications. The specs should consider the configuration of the hardware in the field and attempt to minimize the effect on other systems and the processing schedule. Requirements should be established to verify that the hardware is being operated within the certified limits. This is especially important when changes in one system can affect the configuration of another system. Communication between system teams is also critical so both teams understand when their hardware is affected.","Lesson ID":2838}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Future mechanical system designs should attempt to eliminate the need for a torque limiter and any type of clutch\/brake assembly. This is especially true for any actuator that will have a long service life. Ideally the hardware should be designed to withstand the maximum output loads of the actuator. Even with torque limiters, many of the orbiter\u2019s mechanical systems were not completely protected for jam conditions. In a system with an over-center linkage design, there is a huge mechanical advantage as the linkage reaches on-center. As such, the loads in the linkage are high for a relatively low input torque. Analysis showed that the ET door uplock latch system was not well protected by the torque limiter. A jam near the end of the latching cycle would cause the hook to yield before the torque limiter would slip. For future programs\/designs where a torque limiter is necessary, new torque limiter designs should be considered for improved reliability and serviceability.","Lesson ID":2839}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For ground cooling equipment at the launch pad used to reject varying spacecraft heat loads prior to launch, circulate a primary loop single-phase refrigerant through the spacecraft-to-ground heat exchanger while maintaining a constant heat load via a heater on a secondary ground loop that rejects heat to a tertiary two-phase refrigeration loop operating at a single set point.","Lesson ID":2736}
{"Recommendation(s)":"To improve the operability of any new space vehicle, the architecture should be designed from the outset to be more efficient. The operational effect of design approaches should be defined, quantified, and traded against performance enhancements early in the development cycle.","Lesson ID":2616}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Require qualified helicopter pilots to perform engine runs and develop formal training sessions to ensure safety.","Lesson ID":2576}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Management should improve their approach for assuring that employees consider the safer means of performing a task before they begin. The approach should be clearly communicated to all through a formal work permit process for assessing the risk of working on electrically energized systems as defined in NFPA 70E,paragraph 110.8(B). The contractor should establish a formal and auditable permitting process for energized electrical work per the guidelines of NFPA 70E and OSHA requirements NASA should prepare and execute a surveillance plan for providing oversight of contracts that address compliance with contractual safety requirements (e.g., National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace) and federal law regarding safety (i.e., OSHA Regulations). A hazard analysis should be performed for all critical work that includes an overall risk assessment, PPE evaluation, safe operating procedures and appropriate training. Supervisors\/managers should ensure that employees are knowledgeable of the systems they work with and tasks that they perform, providing training where necessary. When it appears that tasks cannot be performed in a safe de-energized state, the task should be presented in an open forum with management and knowledgeable personnel for further assessment.","Lesson ID":2696}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Always plan adequately for compatibility testing. Always follow best engineering practices during testing: review, manage the configuration, and follow all procedures in the test documentation (e.g., setup and verification procedures, test procedures, test commands). Perform any setup activities that can be done before the test to save time during the test. Document results of each step of the test, including any unexpected results, malfunctions, anomalies, or hardware\/software changes.","Lesson ID":2157}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Identify risks for disposition and excess of hardware, by analyzing all process flows. Ensure the applicable subsystem owner or user is identified prior to hardware entering the excess process. Modify the computerized logistics system to permit entry and designation of integrated hardware. Train material handling personnel in flight hardware handling and identification.","Lesson ID":2037}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Use material movement personnel and equipment that have been trained and\/or certified to move JCI. Verify that project personnel involved in preparations for loading and shipping JCI are familiar with requirements for special (e.g., international) shipping. Cognizant personnel should stop unplanned JCI transportation operations until a review by all required JPL organizational participants has taken place. For all planned and unplanned transportation of JCI, including loading and unloading operations, ensure that System Safety, Hardware Quality Assurance (HQA), and Shipping\/Receiving (Reference (7)) have been informed of the operation. (It is acceptable, on a case-by-case basis, for either System Safety or HQA to be present during the operation. This is to be determined as a joint decision between System Safety and HQA.) If use of contracted transportation services and equipment is required, perform a dry run of the operation without moving JCI. Confirm that the transportation company has provided adequate qualified staff, and verify vehicle equipment (e.g., lift gate) functionality during the dry run. When released, Revision 8 of the JPL Flight Project Practices (JPL DocID 58032) will require that each project develop a Transportation Plan to describe project plans for safe transportation of flight hardware and critical support equipment. In addition, transportation plans for the Aquarius project (and future flight projects planning international shipments) should incorporate contingency planning to anticipate the availability of less than optimal transportation resources for JCI.","Lesson ID":2456}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Utilize the findings of the Phoenix EDL reconstruction for the improvement of future Mars EDL models and prediction tools, and for optimizing future system and mission designs that feature an EDL mission phase. Consider allocating resources in flight project budgets for an EDL reconstruction to be scheduled as soon after planetary landing as feasible.","Lesson ID":2516}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Some type of human error can be traced to nearly every studied incident as a root cause, whether it be an error in the design phase or an error prior to or during operational use of hardware containing hypergols. Humans are most definitely not perfect and even when the most knowledgeable personnel are intimately involved in the design phase (vehicle or GSE) or during an operation, mistakes can be made and critical items can be overlooked. One can deduce, however, that most incidents happen during some sort of dynamic operation. Hypergols tend to be very stable in a static configuration (as long as the compatibility characteristics have been well addressed). An effort should be made to allow for multiple \u201csets of eyes\u201d to study hypergol system designs, procedures, system configurations, and training plans.). In several of the incidents advance warning (prior to any liquid or vapor release) was available to the technicians in the vicinity of the spill and\/or the engineers that were monitoring from a remote location. The warning indications include off-nominal data (remote or local), off-nominal system characteristics, and\/or local changes that occurred without human intervention. Some of these went unnoticed or were ignored during the operation, thus resulting in an incident. There was advance warning in 19 out of 38 total incidents (50% of the time). This percentage does not include spilled fuel as an advance warning of a fire (five occurrences). Depending on the local environment, there is a reasonable probability that if hydrazine (or one of its derivatives) is spilled, there will be a fire; therefore, the fuel spill itself could be considered an advance warning of a fuel fire. Roughly 42% of the documented fuel spills studied resulted in a fire or explosion. It could not be determined if there was an advanced warning for two of the incidents; therefore, they were not included in the above percentage along with the mentioned five fuel spills. Technicians and engineers should be cognizant of system changes during hypergol operations.","Lesson ID":2196}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Material certifications should be submitted and approved for any kind of painting or coating of equipment. The changes to coating or painting process used at the facility performing the work should be approved and certified to ensure that the facility can perform the requirements according to the specification. The customer should also make a site visit to the facility during the coating process and perform a QC inspection to verify all required steps in the process are being performed.","Lesson ID":2356}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Reference (3) provides the following observations and recommendations for test control systems, training, and test procedures that should be considered in planning and managing future environmental test programs: Test Control System Lessons Learned When software updates that containquotpatchesquot to improve system operation and repair problems are not installed upon receipt from the vendor, the test equipment may not operate as expected. In this case, the vendor of the controller used in the acoustic chamber had provided software updates to JPL in 2004, 2005, and 2006 and recommended their installation, but JPL had not installed them and was using an earlier software release. When user-definable parameters in the controller (e.g., the time constant, the control speed, and the maximum drive change) are not set to the values recommended by the vendor, the discrepancies can disrupt testing and contribute to a mishap. The control system set-up and monitoring for acoustic testing of flight hardware always needs to be checked and verified by a second test engineer. It is also imperative that a second party verifies all settings. A record must be made of all critical parameters in the controller software configuration file that are changed or modified, with documentation of who made the changes or why the changes were made. Prior to use of the acoustic test controller, it must be verified that it adequately protects the hardware even when the operator fails to follow the correct procedure. Under these Aquarius test conditions, the installed version of the software should have reduced the drive by 50 percent and aborted the test, but it did neither. Test Control System Recommendations Test chamber controller software updates should be installed each time they are received, vendor-defined parameters should be implemented, and the system should be completely checked out prior to testing flight hardware. Verify acoustic test controller parameters\/limits by the appropriate dynamics and quality assurance personnel prior to initiation of tests. A second party should also check the setting of instrumentation parameters, such as sensitivity and full scale, which can affect the accuracy of the test data during flight hardware testing. The test conductor should fully understand the necessary test safeguards, confirm (with the chamber empty) that the safeguards are in place and that the safeguard parameters are sufficient, and make any controller software changes necessary to protect the hardware when it is tested. Knowledge\/Training Lessons Learned The JPL Quality Assurance (QA) representative present during the test operations should have the detailed knowledge of the test operations needed to verify the status of the acoustic testing and of the test control system. Also, QA should implement a formal process to obtain the proper approvals to perform the troubleshooting steps and to record those steps. If data is missing from the quotas runquot copy of a test procedure because it was not fully updated, it may be very difficult to replicate the test or verify that the test was performed correctly. To avoid human error, test operators need to follow the step-by-step instructions in the written test procedure instead of relying on memory. Human error has often been the primary or a contributing factor in test anomalies. Test operators need to have a thorough understanding of the test controller quotinner workingsquot critical for the protection of the test equipment and flight hardware under test. They must understand the error messages from the control system and the implications of the commands they give to the control system. Knowledge\/Training Recommendations QA personnel assigned to witness a test should be trained in the basic theory of operation of the equipment and the test facility. QA personnel should have the authority to require approval of any troubleshooting that involves critical equipment, and they should properly record the troubleshooting steps taken. QA and the cognizant design engineer should ensure that all applicable instructions are included prior to approving the test procedure. Test operators should pay special attention to updating the quotas runquot test procedure, entering all the required data and information. Train personnel in the proper use of test procedures. In all cases, rigorously enforce use of step-by-step instructions to assure that each instruction is precisely followed. Provide comprehensive training for acoustic control system operators in the system operation principles and practice, as well as all features of the control system, including software safeguards and error messages. Test Procedures Lessons Learned The Aquarius Reflector acoustic test procedure lacked complete instructions for configuring the controller software prior to the test. Although JPL was the test facility operator, no QA discrepancy reports were generated and troubleshooting was conducted in accordance with the reflector contractor's test procedure. The JPL Dynamic Environments engineer assigned to witness the acoustic testing and provide technical assistance was never contacted by the test conductor or by JPL test personnel and informed that an acoustic test was going to be performed as part of the troubleshooting process. The roles and responsibilities of the various personnel involved in the Aquarius acoustic test operations were not clearly documented. This could lead to confusion during test operations. Although the test personnel knew that the test conductor was the person responsible for the test, the JPL test procedure did not mention a test conductor or director. The reflector was left in the chamber while performing critical equipment troubleshooting tests to resolve irregularities in the acoustic data. There was no formal agreement between the Aquarius Project and the reflector contractor who performed the test in a JPL facility regarding their respective responsibilities and obligations in the conduct of the acoustic test. Test Procedures Recommendations For every test of flight hardware, provide a detailed procedure with instructions on pre-test, test, and post-test operations, including such steps to configure the controller as setting the test parameters. In no case should reliance be placed on the operators' memory. If a test failure or problem occurs during test of flight hardware in a JPL test facility, the response should conform to JPL policies and procedures governing the documentation and approval of recovery measures and corrective actions. Test lab operations personnel and the test conductor are responsible for assuring that the JPL dynamic environments engineer is present and intimately involved in all dynamic test operations. In addition to defining the roles and responsibilities of test personnel, the test procedure should identify the individuals by name to eliminate any source of confusion. Prior to testing, develop a list of the names of key personnel that clearly states (1) who absolutely needs to be present and (2) other personnel whose presence is not so essential that testing should be delayed if they are unavailable. Flight articles should be removed from the test facility when there are uncertainties in the environments to which they may be subjected during troubleshooting. Require a written agreement between the flight project and its contractor(s) that stipulates their responsibilities and obligations in the conduct of JPL facility-supported tests. Provide a checklist or template that lists the important elements as an aid for flight projects that need to write such formal agreements.","Lesson ID":2419}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Reference (2) provides 24 recommendations for improving measurement analysis of telecom hardware RF signals during ATLO (JPL quotAssembly, Test, and Launch Operations,quot aka System Integration & Test), including the following: Test Planning Gain a good understanding of the ground support equipment (GSE) to be used for the test, including measurement accuracies, noise floors and system noise, and idiosyncrasies. Perform a cursory measurement uncertainty analysis to understand nominal and worst case error bars: Prepare a block diagram that includes all components and interfaces, with any components that are measured together treated as a single component. Assign loss values, reflection coefficients, and uncertainties. Cite expected nominal measurement values and uncertainties in the test procedure, in order to highlight any unexpected values. The hardware configurations and Special Test Requests (STR) test scope should take into account the uncertainty analysis and error bars developed earlier. Maintain up-to-date current best estimate (CBE) values (i.e., allocations, piece part data sums, and CBE based on prior measurements) to ensure valid measurement predicts. Plan to perform telecom subsystem end-to-end path loss measurements (1) for as complete a path as practical and (2) independently of the flight system. Strive for a consistent hardware operational configuration between tests (e.g., assembly on\/off states) in order to reduce the number of variables and error sources. Cross-train telecom subsystem team members in as many subsystem technical areas as practical, particularly in GSE procedures and performance. Test Execution and Review Walk through the STR, including specific commands where possible, with the test conductor prior to the initiation of testing. Assign a single engineer to be responsible for GSE setup and operation (e.g., meter calibration\/setting, general health check and monitoring). Schedule two engineers to crew the test console throughout the test to monitor and record parameters, and interpret and update telemetry values. Record all pertinent data obtained during testing. If data is not available or a test operation is skipped, document the reason for the missing data.

{"Recommendation(s)":"The findings of the NASA Mishap Investigation Board (MIB) for OCO that were not restricted as proprietary information, or as International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)-sensitive, were released as Reference (1). Although no flight hardware from the OCO mission was recoverable for examination, the MIB identified four potential causes that could have led to the failure, along with related recommendations: Frangible Joint Subsystem failure caused fairing not to separate. It could not be determined if the frangible joint base ring fractured completely as designed. An incomplete fracture could have resulted in the fairing not separating. The MIB looked at the materials used and their characteristics and recommended: 1-1. Verify that the Taurus launch vehicle frangible joint extrusions have a traceable pedigree on future NASA missions. If pedigree cannot be verified, remove and replace the assigned hardware with frangible joints that have a complete pedigree. 1-2. Establish a single heat treat lot requirement for aluminum used to manufacture extrusion and perform sub-scale tests on the lot. 1-3. Institute permanent marking (which cannot be removed during processing) along the length of the extrusion at intervals to ensure traceability. 1-4. Implement a common procurement and assembly process for frangible joints used on the launch vehicle. Electrical Subsystem failure caused fairing not to separate. It could not be determined if the transient bus supplied sufficient electrical current to initiate the required ordnance devices. Insufficient current could have resulted in an insufficient quantity of ordnance devices firing, causing the fairing not to separate. The MIB recommended: 2-1. Scale (or rescale) launch vehicle telemetry to allow the transient power bus measurements to fully capture peak currents during flight. 2-2. Institute a process that monitors, captures, and analyzes Power Distribution Unit current output profiles during acceptance test and during flight simulations. Fairing Pneumatic System failure caused fairing not to separate. It could not be determined if the fairing pneumatic system supplied sufficient pressure to separate the fairing. The fairing pneumatic system consists of the hot gas generator (HGG) system, thrusters, and pneumatic tubing. The MIB recommended: 3-1. Implement the following items into the HGG system. If the items cannot be fully implemented, then replace the HGG system with an alternate fairing jettison system that does not use a hot gas generator: The HGG system should be qualified and acceptance tested in the flight-like configuration and environment. Define and document the HGG sustainer grain propellant radiographic acceptance criteria, including the engineering rationale and applicability for using non-Taurus manufacturer criteria for the Taurus application. Modify the HGG design to retain small propellant pellets and preclude movement during dynamic environments. Assure that HGG ignition occurs when the HGG system is subjected to all induced thermal and dynamic environments. Provide a controlled, verifiable, and repeatable means for mounting the HGG in the Taurus Launch Vehicle fairing for flight and for qualification and acceptance testing for flight. 3-2. Demonstrate that the pressure cartridges' initiation charge remains in contact with the bridgewire after being subjected to Taurus thermal and dynamic environments. 3-3. Establish functional performance requirements for pressure cartridges that screen for workmanship and lot-to-lot variability (i.e., time to first pressure, time to peak pressure and thermal time constant). 3-4. Assure manufacturing and inspection processes are consistent with the pressure cartridge design requirements. Flexible Confined Detonating Cord (FCDC) Snagged on Frangible Joint Side Rail Nut Plate. It could not be determined if the FCDC snagged on the frangible joint side rail nut plate, preventing the fairing from separating. The MIB recommended: 4-1. Route the FCDC, or implement a physical barrier, to exclude the possibility that the FCDC would snag on a nut plate cover.","Lesson ID":2257}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Reference (5) suggests the following steps to mitigate the risk from defects in the FSW development process. Some of these have been addressed in JPL software development process procedures: Adopt a risk-based approach to software engineering. Software development resources may not be allocated optimally because of overly optimistic estimates of software reuse, inability to accurately estimate the cost of new code, reallocation of hardware functionality to FSW, hardware that operates differently than planned, contracts bid using overly optimistic cost assumptions, a shortened FSW development schedule due to late hardware delivery, and delays in FSW testing due to late delivery of flight-like testbeds. Where resource limitations constrain the project\u2019s ability to perform every preferred software development practice in a manner that yields benefits, software practices should be assessed for risk mitigation potential and adopted based on value. Recommendations 2 through 9 may also help to mitigate software engineering risk. Involve software engineers in the early, system-level, project decisions that determine flight system characteristics (e.g., performance, reliability, flexibility), flight system cost, and the role of FSW in the performance of spacecraft flight system functions. Provide projects with the requisite software development infrastructure prior to project commencement. To avoid disrupting FSW development, make any changes to the software development process-- or to tools that are inadequate or poorly integrated-- before software engineers are assigned to the project. Develop simulations of instruments and other custom hardware that interfaces with FSW at the earliest point at which their behavior is understood. Use these simulations in regression tests of FSW logic, and later for testing in the flight-like environment. Avoid deferring all FSW testing to the end of FSW development when there are fewer resources available to fix problems. Before coding begins, prepare an FSW architecture specification for use in developing the conceptual architecture, realizing the architecture as a high-level integrated flight system design, and managing subsequent changes. As code is written and actual data is obtained on resource usage and performance characteristics, reassess the architecture and the detailed technical decisions based on the variance from earlier estimates. Define a suite of flight system architectures that are each capable of supporting a commonly-flown category of JPL mission (e.g., \u201cPlanetary Rover,\u201d \u201c4 Instruments or Less,\u201d and \u201cHigh-Bandwidth Communications\u201d). This will significantly ease the problem of project requirements and hardware that are unstable and project software simulations and flight-like testbeds that are unavailable. Development of a complete and consistent set of engineering requirements requires a robust systems engineering process that defines performance and resource utilization requirements, traces requirements to higher and lower-level requirements, ensures review of requirements by key stakeholders and by parties independent of the engineering of the requirements, and assesses the requirements using a checklist of questions that address quality concerns. Use objective measures to monitor FSW development progress and to determine the adequacy of software verification activities. To reliably assess FSW production and quality, these measures should include metrics such as the percentage of code, requirements, and defined faults tested, and the percentage of tests passed in both simulation and testbed environments. These measures should also identify the number of units where both the allocated requirements and the detailed design have been baselined, where coding has been completed and successfully passed all unit tests in both the simulated and testbed environments, and where they have successfully passed all stress tests. Manage FSW development using an integrated system. Use of separate \u201cstovepiped\u201d commercial or JPL-developed systems for FSW requirements definition, action item tracking, problem reporting, and scheduling inhibits effective management of FSW development.","Lesson ID":2218}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Capabilities of all Centers CAD environments must be understood prior to securing new work. The CAD environment setup, hardware, software and network should be thoroughly evaluated to ensure capability to handle very large file sizes such as assembly drawings necessary for future flight projects. This assessment should be conducted by utilizing large system level drawings typical of the new work that NASA is currently involved in, especially Constellation. In addition, the designers need to be involved in the process of setting up the CAD environment, including requirements such as: knowledgeable parties, expertise, infrastructure, equipment, software..etc. This assessment can be used as a guide to evaluate the current CAD environment capability to meet future work needs. For example, 060213MFA000 is a USS top level drawing that exemplifies the difficulties GRC had with large drawings. This is primarily a system level drawing, typical of future work, such as ARES V. It is recommended that this drawing be used to assess the current GRC CAD environment.","Lesson ID":2051}

{"Recommendation(s)":"VDA should not be considered an off-the-shelf process: a candidate VDA process should be carefully evaluated to ensure suitability for the application. Do not assume a generic suitability solely based on process use on previous reflectors. Surface roughening using green nylon mesh pads or grit blasting prior to VDA application is a poorly controlled process that may significantly compromise the VDA surface conductivity and should not be used without appropriate evaluation.

Prior to issuing an RFP, the prime contractor should review OSHA Standards and letters of Standard Interpretations to properly classify work. NASA\/KSC and prime contractors should review current ongoing work involving roofing to ensure proper work classification and compliance with OSHA Standards and letters of Standard Interpretation. Prime contractors should develop a mechanism to ensure that OSHA noncompliances immediately dangerous to life and health are reported to the subcontractor president\/top management. Develop a mechanism to ensure that OSHA noncompliances immediately dangerous to life and health are reported to the subcontractor president\/top management. - Other prime contractors should develop a similar mechanism to ensure that OSH noncompliances immediately dangerous to life and health are reported to the subcontractor president\/top management. - For construction contracts that NASA\/KSC issues, NASA\/KSC should develop a similar mechanism to ensure that OSHA noncompliances immediately dangerous to life and health are reported to the contractor president\/top management Prime contractor safety specialists should trend noncompliances and discuss them at the appropriate contractor\/subcontractor safety meeting. For construction contracts that NASA\/KSC issues, NASA\/KSC should trend noncompliances and discuss them at the appropriate contractor safety meeting. NASA\/KSC should develop and implement a fall protection policy and program for low-sloped roofing work that is more stringent than the applicable OSHA standard and requires the use of physical restraints when working within 6 feet of the edge. The use of warning lines and safety monitors or other nonphysical-restraint systems should be reserved for special circumstances after review and approval through a NASA\/KSC formalized variance process. A Center-wide fall protection team (civil servants and contractors) should be formed to examine issues (e.g., standardization across contractors, variance processing, retrofitting of existing facilities) arising from the implementation of a new, more stringent fall protection policy and program.","Lesson ID":2056}

Approaches should not be limited to thermal cycle testing but could include other options for strain distribution in a bonded joint. Consider alternative joining methods for attaching fittings to spacecraft structures. For example, mechanical fasteners may serve as a substitute or reinforcement for bonding where there is uncertainty in analyses of the integrity of the bonded joint design.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Furnish appropriate educational materials, such as a \"complexity primer,\" and submit lessons learned on FSW complexity to the NASA Lesson Learned Information System (LLIS). Where well-substantiated requirements are exceedingly difficult to implement in software, software managers should proactively inform the project of the impact. In some cases this might stimulate new discussion to relax hard-to-achieve requirements. Project managers should promote the value of multi-disciplinary trade studies in reducing downstream complexity, and project engineers should raise complexity concerns as they become apparent. Allocate a larger percentage of project funds to up-front architectural analysis in order to achieve project cost savings. Increase the number and authority of software architects. Create a professional architecture review board to provide constructive early feedback to projects. Involve mission operators in flight\/ground trade studies and in decisions to descope FSW. Quantify the costs and risks of operational workarounds before reassigning a FSW function or fix to mission operations. Develop a NASA Fault Management Handbook to provide guidance in fault management requirements specification, design, and test. Schedule fault management reviews in proposals and project plans. Sponsor or facilitate the inclusion of fault management courses within university engineering programs. Analyze a candidate COTS product for the ability to separate its components and features, and weigh the cost of testing unwanted features against the cost of in-house development. To cope with the inevitable defects in new or revised FSW, conduct randomized testing to avoid bias toward specific sources of error, extend fault protection to cover software faults as well as hardware faults, and employ fault containment techniques to mitigate the likelihood that residual defects will combine to produce complex error scenarios.","Lesson ID":2050}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The recommendation is that designers should be trained to understand the risk inherent in designing load carrying parts that incorporate critical welds in 6000 series aluminum.

{"Recommendation(s)":"PTC characteristics and limitations vary with cell manufacturer and are rarely provided. This information should be obtained by testing prior to considering a battery design for a specific application. The cell series voltage should not exceed the PTC withstanding voltage. For high-voltage batteries, diodes added to a series string of cells can improve their safety under external short conditions. The diodes must be carefully matched to battery characteristics. In high-voltage and high-capacity batteries where the CID is used as a level of safety control, overcharge tests need to be performed to confirm its safe operation. The number of cells recommended for use in parallel depends on the charge current. The total charge current used to charge a bank (cells in parallel) should in no way cause an increase in PTC resistance of any single cell. In other words, in the event that all cell CIDs but one have opened, the current seen by the remaining cell should not cause an increase in PTC resistance. The CID voltage tolerance should also be characterized. The charger voltage limit should be set so that the difference between the voltage limit value and the end-of-charge battery voltage does not cause CID arcing. The main causes of failure that prevent the CID from proper safing are the charge current (causing inadvertent PTC activation), high temperatures (causing PTC activation or uncontrollable thermal runaway), and high voltages (causing PTC ignition).","Lesson ID":2046}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When close sequential firing of the redundant initiator is necessary, the NESC recommends the skew time between initiator firings should ideally be longer than the flow duration for single fire. Thus the NESC recommendation that use of the device should be constrained to single fire operation (or dual with skew greater than 2 milliseconds) to ensure robustness of booster ignition.

{"Recommendation(s)":"It is important that every fiber connector be inspected and cleaned prior to mating. An acceptable fiber optic connector endface will be properly polished, clean, and free of scratches, cracks, and spalls. Clean fiber optic components are a requirement for quality connections between fiber optic equipment. One of the most basic and important procedures for the maintenance of fiber optic systems is to clean the fiber optic equipment. Any contamination in the fiber connection can cause failure of the component or failure of the whole system. Even microscopic dust particles can cause a variety of problems for optical connections. A particle that partially or completely blocks the core generates strong back reflections, which can cause instability in the laser system. Dust particles trapped between two fiber faces can scratch the glass surfaces. Even if a particle is only situated on the cladding or the edge of the endface, it can cause an air gap or misalignment between the fiber cores which significantly degrades the optical signal. When you clean fiber components, always complete the steps in the procedures carefully. The goal is to eliminate any dust or contamination and to provide a clean environment for the fiber-optic connection. Remember that inspection, cleaning and re-inspection are critical steps which must be done before you make any fiber- optic connection.","Lesson ID":1876}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Reference (3) provides detailed guidelines for the selection and application of DC-DC converters. The most significant recommendations provided by Reference (1) include: Device Application and Test Contact the vendor technical representative to discuss questionable applications, recognizing that the product data sheets do not typically list all the available information about DC-DC converters. Recognize that commercial off-the shelf (COTS) converters are less stable at very light (< 20%) loads. Projects that vet the more highly loaded applications should not assume that lightly loaded applications will have no issues. COTS hybrid EMI filters have undamped resonances and require additional external parts to ensure the stability of the filter-converter combination. Projects must analyze the overall circuit and add parts (e.g., L-R and\/or R-C networks) to damp filter resonances and guarantee stability of the filter-converter combination over the applications range of input voltage, output load, and temperature. Although the synchronization function is often needed for JPL missions to control noise, it should be used only when absolutely necessary. The external synchronization function is very sensitive to synch signal amplitude, frequency, rise\/fall time, and circuit grounding. Misapplication results in increased noise or oscillation at the converter output. Characterize DC-DC converters under flight-like input voltage ramp conditions. A typical flight application may not provide a sufficient input voltage ramp rate to mitigate the input voltage and current spike or to turn on the device without oscillation. Additional DC-DC converter testing recommendations were provided in a 1998 lesson learned (Reference (4)). Device Reliability Perform Parts Stress Analysis (PSA) on the internal device circuit; avoid simply derating the device as a quotblack box.quot Perform Worst Case Analysis (WCA) on DC-DC converters, analyzing not only the total radiation dose but also the enhanced low dose rate and displacement damage effects. Review changes to the design or to vendor processes that occur after the device is flight qualified, and request an updated analysis or requalification if needed. Verify product data sheet claims regarding device radiation hardness by analysis or test. Device Quality Assure that a customer precap visual inspection is performed by a properly trained device inspector as these frequently identify defects requiring rework. Perform customer DPA on all non-Class K device lots because some defects occur after device lid sealing and screening. Device Procurement Selection of a device vendor on the Qualified Manufacturers List is strongly recommended to achieve device quality Because MIL-PRF-38534 has deficiencies even for Class K devices, employ a statement of work (SOW) or source control drawing (SCD) to add customer precap visual inspection, capacitor and Schottky diode screening, and periodic MIL-PRF-38534 Group C (especially life test) testing. Plan for converter procurement as long lead time (i.e., greater than 6-month) items because the desired converter will not typically be available from vendor inventory. Seek to procure high quality devices. The total cost of lower quality, including upscreening and the cost and schedule impact of lot failures on the project, may greatly exceed the initial cost of the higher quality devices. It is vital that the project plan and budget for a monitoring team representing the design engineering, electronic parts engineering, quality assurance engineering, and reliability engineering functions throughout the procurement cycle to resolve issues related to device application or lot failures.","Lesson ID":1879}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Use of plated waveguides is to be avoided in telecommunications system design. If plating is needed to reduce RF loss or to obtain thermal properties, maintain close scrutiny over the waveguide supplier (e.g., oversight of the dip brazing and plating processes). For both plated and un-plated waveguides, collect data and maintain rigorous verification of the dip braze salt removal process. Perform DPA on samples of all waveguide lots, including verification of structural integrity. Engineering notes on waveguide design drawings should mandate: Cleaning of the waveguide and performing conductivity tests to verify the absence of brazing salts on all waveguides in accordance with the customer-approved procedure. Heat treating for 8 hours at 340- 360F per AMS 2772 with required T condition specified in accordance with structural requirements and analyses. Perform hardness measurements on all waveguides. Application of a chemical conversion coat, plate, or paint in accordance with appropriate military specifications. Require coupons for verification of each process.

Provide ample and reliable onboard data storage to accommodate periods when downlink is not available.","Lesson ID":1843}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The preferred shipping method is to transport all flight hardware, either international or domestic, by the hand carry method where feasible. This minimizes the risk of third-party handling and maximizes the safety of the flight hardware in transit. It is further recommended that when third-party handling is unavoidable, special precautionary methods be implemented as follows: Packaging design should be reviewed and pre-approved by the cognizant engineer with concurrence by the project safety engineer and the Quality Assurance Engineer. Packaging material and marking should meet the requirements of Reference (3). A packaging inspection report should be generated by the quality assurance engineer at the source and destination port to assure that the critical item was packaged and safely received. Each project should develop a CHHP which addresses how flight and other critical item hardware is to be transported from and to JPL and pulls together all the current documented JPL requirements affecting packaging and shipment. The CHHP should also address when an independent courier service can or cannot be used.","Lesson ID":1849}

To ensure that Human Engineering is not overlooked within each system, e.g., Mechanical, Electrical, Fluids, etc., each system should have its own Human Engineering section to confirm that this particular system has been addressed by Human Engineering. Within this section, useful parts of MIL-STD-1472 and other applicable Human Engineering documents that apply to this system should be listed.","Lesson ID":1831}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Consider using the Phoenix IR format as a model for future missions that feature substantial inheritance. Prepare and implement the IR plan in concert with mission assurance program activities. Plan carefully for the collection and analysis of records documenting the system and subsystem pedigree. Provide ample lead time for obtaining missing drawings, parts\/materials lists, or test data, and for resolving issues relating to environmental qualification, commercial parts, materials storage life, and discrepant analyses. Assign JPL staff to monitor contractor progress in supplying the documentation. When specifying deliverable engineering documentation in system contracts, assume that drawings, build records, test data, MRBs, etc., will be needed later to assess the pedigree of inherited hardware, software, and system and subsystem designs. Assure that the flight project or the institution makes arrangements to archive project engineering (and supporting) data after the project is disbanded.","Lesson ID":1807}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For mission-critical components used in flight hardware and in JPL Critical Items (JCI): Assure Awareness of Counterfeiting.Charter an internal anti-counterfeiting task force with representation from key procurement, engineering, manufacturing, and legal organizations. Develop and deploy anti-counterfeit education and training programs for internal and external stakeholders. Benchmark other companies and suppliers, share best practices, and pool information on anti-counterfeiting strategies. Implement Prevention Strategies. The following preventive strategies have proven effective: Designers must proactively manage the product lifecycle against the component lifecycle and update a design when products are hard-to-find or unavailable. Know your source: build a relationship with suppliers, conducting surveys of their inspection and testing capabilities and audits of their counterfeit prevention programs. Institute an approved vendor list policy for independent distributors, ascertaining that they are certified to ISO 9000 and have not had previous problems with counterfeit parts. Require a documented trail identifying the source of the material, and work with the OCM to obtain photos of the parts or labels for validation. Procurement should buy direct from original manufacturers or their authorized distributors, verify that manufacturers have guaranteed methods to destroy scrapped parts, and buy adequate stock of last time buys. When buying from third-party independent distributors, require proof of traceability to the original component manufacturer and be aware that pursuing the lowest possible price can lead to sourcing problems. Make purchases contingent upon the outcome of evaluation, testing, or after verification of authenticity. Institute Detection Strategies-- Inspect, Test, and Evaluate. The following detection strategies may minimize the risk of counterfeits: Require rigorous quality assurance on all parts. Do not substitute paperwork for testing and visual inspection. Upgrade inspection training and procedures for identifying counterfeit components. Examine labels for misspellings, omissions (missing sales order number, missing lot numbers), date codes on the label that do not match the date code on the part, inconsistent formatting, etc. Establish and maintain a package and die pedigree photo collection to help identify counterfeits. Verify the part markings with the manufacturer when buying from independent suppliers. Maintain a reference library of manufacturer data books on obsolete components. Electrically test any material from questionable sources. Employ Destructive Physical Analysis (DPA) to deconstruct sample parts. Implement Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods where applicable. Respond to Disclosures. Participate in reporting and cooperate in investigation programs for suspect devices; respond to reports, including those from the Government\/Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) and the Electronic Resellers Association International (ERAI). Cooperate with the NASA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in any action against suspected counterfeiters.","Lesson ID":1832}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Lock system reliability into the early design such that the test program is relied upon for screening and verification. Emphasize identification and elimination of safety-critical and mission-critical single point failures, independent of numerical estimates of the failure probability. Assure that a strong quotsystems reliability groupquot is involved in evaluating alternative designs very early in the project life cycle. This early involvement should extend down to the subcontractor level, with subcontractors providing inputs to functional and system level reliability analyses. Assure that system requirements are assessed for their reliability impact prior to release of the system-level RFP. Evaluate design alternatives and conduct trade studies at the system level to obtain an optimal overall design. For example, it may be necessary to overcome organizational barriers between projects within the Constellation program to assess whether extra mass should be allocated to the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) launch vehicle, the CEV, or the lunar lander. Provide a primary and a redundant backup where feasible, preferably by dissimilar means, for safety-critical and mission-critical systems. Trade functionality between the lander, the capsule, and the service module to get the optimal integrated solution. For subsystems with a low technology readiness level (TRL) early in project development, mitigate the risk to reliability by funding the parallel development of alternatives. To accommodate future Constellation lunar lander system design changes and unanticipated flight configurations, test critical hardware beyond its qualification test levels until it fails. This allows a more accurate picture of true margin-- important for a new, complex system with many interfaces. This characterization can be used to address unknown problems and future tradeoffs. Consider incurring the additional cost of testing the actual flight hardware to environmental acceptance test levels. Establish success criteria for every test and every flight. Consider testing the Constellation lunar lander systems for the range of environments consistent with different lunar landing locations. Assure that contractors employ rigor in root cause analysis of failures, and provide NASA oversight over the evaluation and implementation of corrective actions. Actively manage performance margins so that the design margin can be allocated optimally. For example, provide a wealth of flight instrumentation and telemetry resources to assist ground controllers in timely identification of problems during mission operations and to support Constellation onboard maintenance. To achieve lunar lander reliability under the Constellation program, provide a strong Lander advocate during the design of the CEV.","Lesson ID":1835}

{"Recommendation(s)":"The key recommendations in Reference (2) state: Operational Procedures and Processes. Ground alarm limits should be set equal to or within expected flight software and hardware performance limits. Projects should be required to conduct, prior to upload, a thorough review of all proposed flight software patches, non-routine parameter and data\/table modifications, and any change affecting fault protection or Contingency\/Safe Mode. Predefined commands should be always used in preference to general memory loads for parameter updates. A thorough flight software configuration management (CM) process, including regular readout and validation of the flight computer memory and maintenance of high-fidelity memory image in the ground testbed, must be in place and rigorously followed. Ground operations should have in place a procedure to quickly acquire stored telemetry and\/or memory readout data upon discovery of a spacecraft fault. Spacecraft Design Weaknesses Operation at an allowable hardware limit should not be interpreted by autonomous fault protection as a fault. All Contingency and Safe Mode attitudes need to be evaluated and designed to provide for thermal safety. Where the design cannot provide for thermal safety along with other health and safety concerns, contingency procedures should be developed as risk mitigation. As a part of a fault response, key data should be captured and returned autonomously to the ground at the next scheduled downlink, without the ground having to send a command. Key data includes fault detection quothigh water marks,quot data concerning the subsystem in which the anomaly occurred, etc. Lifetime Management Considerations Each extended mission should be formally and independently reviewed, across the board, including assessment of whether system-level fault protection parameters are appropriate given the state of the remaining complement of hardware. The operational processes need to be routinely updated to accommodate the changing personnel and operational environment.","Lesson ID":1805}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Recognizing that loss of the ability to command the vehicle is a total loss of mission, consider a design rule that would mandate permanently connecting (hardwiring) receiver power to the power bus, with only the transmitter switched. If a switched receiver design is chosen, provide additional redundancy to prevent the switching device itself from becoming a single failure point in the design. Build redundancy into the receiver's power switching or into the sensed operational status so that on-board EDAC logic can correct an inadvertent mis-configuration. Generate appropriate GIDEP reports or NASA Alerts as a standard element in all investigations of mission operational anomalies. Route these part anomaly alerts to operations personnel on those flight projects that use the part so that workarounds, if feasible, can be implemented. Assure that the flight software has a fault protection feature, such as a set of timed spacecraft-level command loss fault responses, that safeguards against command loss by triggering a system interrupt, return to a prior state, or restart. Assure that the set of fault responses address not just the command processor, but all components that may need to be reset.","Lesson ID":1799}

{"Recommendation(s)":"1. Human Factors Engineering requirements that are carried as applicable requirements should not be ignored; rather they should be (a) adequately funded, (b) implemented in the design definition, and (c) properly verified. 2. Human Factors Engineering personnel with training, experience, and expertise should be hired and retained at NASA and at the contractors as key personnel. 3. Human Factors Engineering design tools should be funded to enable spacecraft-specific research and design development, providing actual data from trade-off studies. Include 1-g full-scale mockups and multi-degrees-of-freedom simulators as well as virtual simulators. 4. Human Factors Engineering awareness training and re-education should be provided to NASA and contractor management, budget controllers, contracting officers, design discipline leads, as well as to legislative and executive branch government leaders. 5. Emphasize that Human Factors Engineering is a primary systems discipline necessary for safe and efficient spaceflight. 6. Human Factors Engineering scope and language at NASA and among the contractors must be standardized with the overall Human Factors Engineering community. For example, does Human Factors Engineering include everything in NASA-STD-3000 or is it limited to what might be funded for crew systems and cockpit layout? For example, does habitable volume mean the same thing to each NASA and contractor player? 7. Human Factors Engineering should be included in the work breakdown structure (WBS) of the new program, Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). Preferably this should be done in the Systems Engineering \/ Systems Integration section; alternatively a standard Human Factors Engineering statement should be called out in every WBS callout for deliverables having human interfaces. 8. Spaceflight proposals should include a stand-alone section on Human Factors Engineering, with emphasis on scope, personnel, resources, and facilities all with sufficient funding to accomplish a successful Human Factors Engineering design. In addition, the introduction and executive summary should make it clear that Human Factors Engineering is a primary system. 9.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Prevention When designing high power RF systems, serious consideration should be given to the role of contamination in causing RF breakdown. Consider materials other than polyimide tape or film for use as contamination barriers. Alternate materials should not be damaged by RF breakdown, and should be thicker than the clearance between switch rotor and housing. Polyimide film may be an acceptable alternative to polyimide tape. Even though it is the pyrolysis of the polyimide material that produces debris, the adhesive on tape (1) adds significant entrapment mechanisms that encourage RF breakdown and (2) increases the likelihood that debris generated by window destruction will cause rotor stiction. The institution should review and standardize usage of polyimide materials as RF contamination barriers. Venting should be accomplished by some means other than holes in the RF windows. A polyimide tape window cannot function as both a contamination barrier and a vent path. To the extent practical, venting of the waveguide elements should be designed to direct gas flow away from contamination sensitive components such as waveguide switches. Although the data does not support atmospheric pressure being the cause of the MRO RF breakdown, it has not been completely ruled out as a contributing factor. The lack of absolute proof suggests that a prudent course for future aerobraking or aerocapture missions would be to design for critical pressure from the outset. Future projects should consider alternative ways of meeting the twin goals documented in the JPL Design Principles (Reference (1)) of continuous spacecraft-Earth communication and (2) minimizing component power cycles and\/or RF switch cycles, by such means as passive coupling, polarization diversity, etc. When a telecommunications design features active switching like MRO, consider alternate switching methods. For some designs, use of redundant amplifiers and transponders may be less risky than RF switch actuation. The cycle life of electronics is probably easier to verify than the cycle life of electromechanical devices, particularly where there may be contamination. The flex waveguide is a potential (though not proven) source of the MRO debris. The MRO flex waveguide was manufactured by mechanical corrugation (quotcrunchingquot) of rectangular copper tubing, which may create debris in a hard-to-inspect part. Consider electroforming, a newer process for fabricating flexible waveguides that is less likely to produce manufacturing debris. The institution should assure that the spacecraft and mission design reflect the provisions relating to redundant hardware, electromechanical devices, and continuous spacecraft-Earth communication that are found in the JPL Design Principles (Reference (1)) and JPL Flight Project Practices (Reference (4)) requirements documents. Mitigation Flight projects should reconsider requesting an exemption to the single-point failure policy that would permit an intermediate position for a waveguide switch similar to the waiver granted MRO (and other recent projects). Projects using waveguide transfer switches should ideally design their spacecraft to be robust in the face of a failure between positions, including such considerations as: - Protecting amplifiers from reflected RF power (e.g., use of isolators) - Verification of relevant component performance in the presence of reflected RF power - Telemetry points sufficient to unambiguously diagnose the condition - Onboard fault protection response (e.g., redundancy management, logic for retries) When evaluating electromechanical devices such as waveguide switches, add torque margins to mitigate against contamination.","Lesson ID":1796}

Ensure that procedures and referenced materials are available to employees at the job site.","Lesson ID":1719}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Manage reaction wheel assemblies as a limited resource: Track RWA performance, beginning with acceptance test and throughout mission operations, to identify potential limitations on reaction wheel lifespan. Where RWA performance data indicates that the RWA lifespan may be constrained, take measures to mitigate the mission impact (save the weaker RWA for end-of-mission, avoid operating bearings at low-rpm regimes conducive to metal-to-metal contact, etc.) To assist in minimizing bearing operating time within the low-speed region, consider using a ground software tool (e.g., RBOT) to carefully manage reaction wheel biasing events. Implement a reaction wheel drag torque estimator in the flight software design to identify any anomalous bearing drag conditions such as cage instability. Mitigate the potential effects of such conditions on overall spacecraft attitude performance by compensating the attitude control torque by the estimated drag torque. (Both the Galileo and Cassini attitude control software were designed to perform this compensation.)","Lesson ID":1598}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Low inductance cabling, kept to minimum length, is mandatory. As a general rule, keep logic circuit power and grounds separated from high current drive circuits, preferably all the way back to the power supply (battery). Minimum ground return inductance must be a design goal. Utilizing heavier copper traces on printed circuit boards, 2 oz. versus 1 oz. copper, especially for ground planes should be considered; ensure that sufficient number of connector pins are used to minimize potential voltage drops; and recognize that the number of feed-throughs, or vias, on a printed circuit board, and their hole-size and plating will have an effect on the inductance of the trace or plane.","Lesson ID":1609}
{"Recommendation(s)":"In choosing a contractor, their domain expertise should be assessed against the requirements of the new environment. The contractor should be required to have a plan for using both analogy and new expertise for problem solution. In cases where the domain expertise lies solely within the Agency, requirements for how that expertise gets transferred to a contractor and how implementation is verified need to be included in new missions. a. The Agency\u00bbs involvement needs to be at a level that is consistent with minimizing the risk to the overall mission meaning the Agency may have to own and share responsibility for the mission design. The requirements for insight and oversight should be established in the contract, be described in the project plan and be commensurate with the amount of risk. a. The Agency should develop guidelines for the appropriate amount of oversight and insight with respect to the resources and politics at risk. b. The requirements established by this process should not be affected by periodic changes in the Agency\u00bbs management.","Lesson ID":1606}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The design and determination of adequate guard-bands, or \u201cdead\u201d bands in critical timing circuits must account for variations in component production lots, temperature stability, and circuit board construction and trace layout.

{"Recommendation(s)":"When supporting upright structure in close proximity to an aircraft or other equipment, use clevises or hoist rings where applicable in combination with wire-rope cables. This will minimize the stretch, as in nylon straps, and eliminate the need for \u201cchoker\u201d loops. When applicable, remove supporting hardware in reverse order of the installation process. Loosening and removing the floor bolts last could have prevented this incident. When working in close proximity to aircraft or other critical equipment, use written procedures to detail each step of the process. Hold a crew brief to explain the steps in the written procedure to all of the crew members. Included in written procedures should be a list of the minimum personnel required and their required disciplines to accomplish the task. Additionally, include a step to rope off the hazardous area to keep people not included in the activities at a safe distance. The roped off area should also be large enough to eliminate distractions from people not included in the hazardous activity. An Operations Manager or Lift Manager, who is removed from the process with no other distractions, should be utilized to oversee the process of all hazardous operations. An Operations Manager or Lift Manager could have identified one or more of the issues and could have prevented the incident. The authority of the Operations\/Lift Manager should be equivalent to a test director having ultimate authority of the roped off area and the hazardous activities. This authority should be communicated in writing to all FLL members that may participate in or witness hazardous activities.","Lesson ID":1597}

Complex checklists should be simplified for daily operations to the maximum extent possible and a second, independent check should be made to verify that each step is completed before moving on to the next. 2. A pilot briefing just prior to the flight should be conducted covering all flight parameters critical to the flight test. The flight test program should provide the pilot with a UAV performance handbook covering the vehicle performance parameters. 3. The flight crew should practice the actual flight test procedures with a low-cost radio controlled model to dry run the procedures and facilitate critical communications between the flight crew during flight, e.g., do not land and go around if the airspeed exceeds a target value. 4. The pilot should be allowed some time on the first flights to perform handling qualities maneuvers at altitudes that support safe recovery from low airspeed maneuvers such as slow flight, stalls and landing configurations. 5. Safety barriers should be used to protect the flight crew during the landing phase.","Lesson ID":1714}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Provide comprehensive pre-launch coordination between the flight project and the Deep Space Network to evaluate initial acquisition signal modes and levels and their strong-signal effects on the station receiving equipment. Ensure that telecommunication engineers a) apprise the flight project of the likelihood of the expected post-launch indications of feedthrough- and saturation-related, downlink signal degradation; b) support the project during initial downlink signal acquisition to distinguish between apparent and real degradation; and c) provide the Flight Control Team with procedures for responding to this anomaly. Reduce the likelihood of errors in the monitoring of station data and the evaluation of the associated predicts during critical mission sequences. This may be accomplished by modifying signal level and signal-to-noise ratio displays to indicate to the FCT when these indicators may be affected by feedthrough or saturation effects. A less preferred alternative to this alert is to modify the link models to mark the predict values that may reach levels subject to feedthrough and saturation.","Lesson ID":1531}

The cognizant design engineer must determine the extreme range of design and test environments based on all life-cycle environments defined in the environmental requirements documentation.","Lesson ID":1532}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The Beta-dot controller was able to eliminate the lateral-directional coupling issues noted previously. The Beta-dot controller was chosen because it was straightforward to implement and had been used successfully in previous programs. The Beta-dot controller uses the rudder pedal input, as well as information from the aircraft sensors for ny, velocity, stability axis yaw rate, pitch angle, and bank angle as inputs. The Beta-dot controller does not use Beta as an input due to the fact that the only source available is from the nose boom measurement of Beta, which is a single-string source. The research controller necessary for flight test is a hybrid controller using dynamic inversion in the longitudinal and lateral axes, with a classical control used in the directional axis. This modification was necessary in order to obtain reasonable flying qualities for the nominal research controller with no neural network adaptation present.","Lesson ID":1525}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Reference (4) provides two major recommendations for preventing in-flight spacecraft and instrument commanding errors: Ensure that each command has a unique and clear identifier, and verify the indicated creation date and time. For example, the characters in the file name should all be the same case (upper or lower), and of a length that can easily be read over the voice-net phonetically. Schedule periodic Flight Team training in command processes, including an overview of the uplink process, discussion of lessons learned, and identification of needed center-wide changes. It also recommends that the Mission Manager and staff: Encourage deliberation in the processing of commands, even if it slows the command uplink process. Minimize the use of real-time commanding in favor of incorporating the commands into sequences, where feasible. Verify, validate, and make maximum use of tools for uplink product generation and product review processing that automate the command uplink process and help to reduce the likelihood of operator error. Tap experienced flight team personnel for critical events, activities new to the Flight Team, recovery from anomalies, and transitioning to a new mission phase. Utilize the full capabilities of the flight system testbed; when in doubt, err on the side of too much testing of commands. Use the standard JPL command uplink process (Reference 5), and share command uplink lessons learned with other projects. Conduct monthly project-level reviews of command anomalies","Lesson ID":1521}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Programs should define roles and responsibilities early all the way down to the supplier level with a clear focal point for communication. The government should play a key role in enabling the full team to communicate and enforce established protocols, responsibilities, and the team's core values early and often. This will provide expected standards of operation that are both established and fully understood for the life of the program.","Lesson ID":1513}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Ensure that all personnel associated with hot work are aware of the hot work permit process and associated requirements. Clearly identify responsibilities including who verifies that precautions have been taken. Ensure a system is in place that will continually verify requirements are being met. (This system should extend to all safety related areas). Ensure all personnel are trained to the proper procedure and that they are following procedures. a) When water is not available, implement a system that ensures safe 'hot' work operations. b) Improve the notification process to assure that the Fire Department is aware anytime that a fire suppression system is taken out-of-service and that the Fire Department is provided a date when service will be restored. a) Ensure all personnel, including supervisory personnel, understand their authority, responsibilities, and limits and that they are trained and have adequate time to perform their jobs. As part of implementing this recommendation the MIT would like the implementer to consider utilization of a transition plan for new supervisors. This would help ensure that all aspects of the position and especially the safety aspects are fully understood. b) Analyze workloads of supervisory personnel (and others as appropriate) to ensure adequate time is available to perform safety aspects of their jobs, including time to become thoroughly knowledgeable of job requirements and procedures, frequently visit work sites, supervise work crews, review hazardous operations with employees, ensure personnel are properly trained, and be aware of physical and mental health of employees which could affect safe job performance. a) An obvious distinction needs to be made between facility fire alarm system pull boxes and all other pull boxes. Also, evaluate the adequacy of existing fire alarm system. b) Evaluate the design\/design review process to ensure the adequacy of the process, that sufficient time is allocated for review, and that the correct disciplines are involved in the review including human factors. a) Temporary configurations need to be reviewed by the appropriate engineering disciplines to ensure safe engineering practices, policies and procedure are followed. b) Immediately stop using tarps in locations where hot work operations are taking place unless they are approved for hot work (flame retardant). Ensure the implementation of all safety related procedures. Any deviations must get adequate review and approval. Furthermore, all emphasis on schedule must be accompanied with an even greater emphasis on safety. If the contractor is penalized for missing schedule because of safety concerns, NASA must be aware of the message being sent.","Lesson ID":1517}

Utilize these forums as an opportunity for team members to question management decisions\/approaches. A definite hierarchy should be established on the documentation to clear up confusion on which requirements take precedence in the event of unforeseen conflicts. Set minimum program standards. For multiple contractors, each NASA assessment team should be trained to understand the requirements before validating them based on the individual contractors designs. A more efficient process for executing to the requirements could be established by involving implementers and stakeholders in the development process to assist in validation and configuration control and eliminate the need for an interpretation document. Guidance and training for requirements generation should be provided to requirements development groups.

Verify assumptions regarding the expected behavior of software modules. Do not use a module without detailed peer review, and assure that all design and test issues are addressed. Where the software development schedule forestalls completion of lower priority action items, maintain a list of incomplete items that require resolution before final configuration of the flight software. Place high priority on completing tests to verify the execution of flight software internal functions. Early in the software development process, create a comprehensive suite of tests and automated analysis tools. Ensure that reporting flight computer related resource usage is included. Ensure that the flight software downlinks data on system resources (such as the free system memory) so that the actual and expected behavior of the system can be compared.

{"Recommendation(s)":"It is recommended that serious attention and care must be taken by project and systems engineering management to ensure that all Safe-To-Mate procedures are given significant priority during the component electrical integration. The key elements to successful application flight hardware power are continual diligence and a detailed understanding of the risks involved with an initial power-on integration operation. This attentive diligence is particularly necessary during early flight hardware integration efforts, because the hardware test configuration is continually changing. In addition, it is recommended that changes to NASA operating procedures, which would affect the safety of personnel or flight hardware, must be approved at the Program management level or above. As applied to this lessons learned, the recommendation would involve signatory authority on a flight hardware integration work orders Finally, authority for managing successful integration effort should be given to systems engineering and quality assurance.

{"Recommendation(s)":"The recommendations are twofold: (1) the FRR Process and (2) a strategy for addressing dissenting opinions. Benchmark Dryden Flight Center's FRR process (Dryden Handbook DHB-X-001) which provides for a robust, independent review of a project's readiness for flight and should be adopted across the Agency. The X-43A Flight Readiness Review (FRR) process defined in Dryden Handbook DHB-X-001, Airworthiness and Flight Safety Review, Independent Review, Mission Success Review, Technical Brief and Mini-Tech Brief Guidelines, appears to be an excellent FRR process that Provides an alternative approach to the more traditional single meeting method Avoids the potential for the large data dump and \u201crubber stamp\u201d type review Allows for FRR initiated actions, necessary response time and appropriate follow up on the identified technical issues.

It takes courage and conviction to openly present and defend a dissenting opinion to a program or organization; thus, it is in NASA's best interest to create an environment that encourages dissenting opinions within its programs. Other organizations within NASA need to develop strategies for handling dissenting opinions. To accomplish this, several issues must be considered including: A policy to address when it is appropriate to communicate a dissenting opinion to an existing independent authority. The necessary monitoring and follow up requirements on referred items. Potential for large resource commitment working phantom issues","Lesson ID":1413}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For NASA missions involving outside partners, the roles of the various in-line and independent engineering and safety organizations should be clearly defined. The expectations of each organization as well as the applicable standards, specifications and processes should be documented as project requirements explicitly in the appropriate document (e.g., Program\/Project Plan, Program Commitment Agreement, Memorandum of Understanding).

{"Recommendation(s)":"Parts Selection and Reliability Analysis Assume that a NSI short (as low as 0 ohms) will occur from the NSI high-side-pin to case-chassis for the entire duration that the \u201cfire\u201d relay is closed. Treat this as an expected transient; not a rare fault condition. Size pyro circuit elements (resistors, relays, PWB traces) to accommodate the calculated current during the NSI short. Include NSI short conditions when performing the Parts Stress Analysis and interface failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA). Include in the worst case short current calculations (MER had resistive circuit limits of about 10-15 amps) the temperature, age, and pulse duration effects on battery impedance. Also include the temperature and life effects on (1) wire impedances and (2) stress limits on series resistors. Retain all NSIs and pyro devices that are fired during test on flight hardware in bonded stores until the end of flight operations, and maintain a detailed installation traceability log for each device used. Read and record post-fire resistance for each NSI tested on a flight system, high side pin-to-case and low side pin-to-case. Generate a failure report for each NSI with low (out of family), post fire resistance. (For example, <100 kilohms). If a Single Point Ground (SPG) fuse is used, (1) test the SPG fuse immediately prior to installation onto a spacecraft, after each removal, and after each reinstallation, (2) assure that the SPG fuse is accessible, and include explicit checks on SPG fuse state in each system test, and (3) exercise each pyro circuit after it is fired during ground NSI firing to verify parts functionality. Power\/Pyro Design Do not extend the fire relay pulse time beyond that required with adequate margin to open the NSI bridgewire. Minimize the activation voltage and\/or current used in the firing circuit to reduce the potential for NSI arcing or electroplating. When using a chassis-grounded firing source, consider a constant current source for the firing circuits. Because pyro initiated plasma effects can propagate into other systems and components, it is important to understand, design and test for such effects in a configuration as similar to flight as possible. Be mindful of where the short circuit current will physically flow. Select and size the firing circuit components to survive at least 4 firings at maximum possible voltage with a NSI 'high side' short to case condition. Locate a current limit resistor in the 'high side' line. Design the activation current, considering all circuit elements, to be 5-7 amperes for each NSI. System Grounding Before deviating from the JPL \u201csoft ground\u201d design principle (or any other design principle), assess the system impact and risk.","Lesson ID":1412}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A Realistic Schedule and Budget Is Needed. Particular attention should be paid to how realistic the schedule is considering the complexity and technical risk involved. A recent study of NASA projects that used a faster-better-cheaper approach indicated that mission failures resulted from highly complex projects on short development timelines. Fixed price contracts should be avoided if development work is required. Such contracts can result in inflated vendor estimates for initial cost and can remove the incentive to aggressively resolve technical issues. Resolution of these issues may not be covered in the budget defined at project start. Technical issues must be addressed early in a project, even in the presence of cost and schedule concerns. These issues can easily become showstoppers later in the integration. Not addressing issues until late in a project will drive up cost and shift schedules to the right. Problems arising from cost and schedule slips and failure to address issues can create adversarial relationships between project participants and the vendor. Fixed price contracts are appropriate when the planned use of the unit is the same as the original application for which the unit was designed. In this case, little or no development work is required. Modifying an aviation navigation unit for use on an unmanned or manned spacecraft should be budgeted and scheduled as a development project. Resources and Schedule Must Be Allocated To Analyze Test Data. When planning a navigation unit missionization and integration, adequate time and personnel must be set aside to analyze flight and ground test data. If data is not thoroughly analyzed in a timely manner, firmware issues will go unnoticed. Lack of resources can even lead to failure to analyze test data. Performance issues arising late in the development and certification cycle can negatively impact cost and schedule. Maintain an Integrated Team Approach. The \u201csuccess oriented\u201d nature of project budgets and schedules sometimes result in limited communication at the technical level. Multiple layers of contractors cut down on communication and should be avoided. The vendor should be involved in all design reviews. Early MAGR\/S project reviews focused on hardware modifications, with little attention paid to firmware. Most technical personnel were \u201cfire walled\u201d from the firmware missionization process and the vendor. No formal, program wide reviews of the GPS receiver firmware modifications were made. The GPS vendor and the Shuttle navigation (both operational and engineering, contractor and civil servant) personnel had minimal involvement in the missionization decisions made by the integrator. The GPS vendor was more fully integrated into the GPS project to enhance communication due to anomalies that surfaced during STS-91. Weekly teleconferences were established that included the vendor and all NASA and contractor organizations. Face to face meetings of all project participants were held at the Johnson Space Center three to four times a year. Special teams that crossed civil servant and contractor boundaries were formed to address specific technical problems. The GPS receiver is a critical part of an EGI. Unfortunately, the user and integrator often have little or no opportunity to interact with the GPS manufacturer on an EGI contract. Contracts concerning EGI units should be written so that the GPS vendor will be involved and able to give advice and information to the EGI manufacturer, the integrator and the user. Produce, Test and Fly Interim Firmware Versions. Firmware issues tend to be discovered sequentially. Units containing complex firmware may not manifest anomalies in the initial round of ground and flight tests. This can lead to a false sense of security about the maturity of a firmware version. Enough rigorous ground and flight testing must be planned to thoroughly exercise the firmware. Schedule and budget should include interim firmware versions to allow issues to be discovered and resolved before a production firmware load is scheduled for certification. Keep Accurate Records. Detailed and accurate records of meetings, issues and issue disposition and design rationale should be maintained. This enables project participants to be better informed on issues facing the project and provides a record for the future. An official issue list should be maintained, along with a list of questions for the vendor and vendor responses. A Close Relationship Between The Vendor And Customer Is Needed. Both the MAGR\/S and SIGI projects demonstrated the need for a close working relationship between the integrator, users and vendor. The navigation vendor needs to be involved in early decisions on architecture and integration. Frequent and open communication between technical personnel should be encouraged. This lesson is best summed up as \u201ccommunicate early, communicate often.\u201d The \u201cthrow a unit and an ICD over the fence\u201d approach can lead to cost and schedule problems. Due to communication constraints imposed by \u201csuccess oriented\u201d budgets and schedules, vendors are frequently not involved in the design of software that is to interface with a GPS or EGI unit. In hindsight, some aspects of the Shuttle GPS integration might have been done differently had the vendor been involved. The Shuttle software that interfaced with the MAGR was designed with an inadequate understanding of the firmware behind the interface definition. This lack of receiver insight was one of the causes of the problems encountered on STS-91. Shuttle software that interfaced with the GPS receiver had to be bullet proofed against known and postulated receiver anomalies. Regular face-to-face contact between the vendor and Shuttle engineers built positive, personal relationships and established a \u201cteam\u201d rather than an \u201cadversarial\u201d environment. Communication between other project participants also improved. Both the vendor and Shuttle Program engineers became familiar with each other\u00bbs \u201cwork cultures,\u201d which enabled them to work better together and provide appropriate support to each other. The vendor also provided much needed education to Shuttle engineers concerning the challenges of GPS receiver design and operation. Use of complex, \u201coff the shelf\u201d aviation navigation units in unmanned and manned space applications requires vendor involvement over and above that provided in terrestrial aviation projects. Educate The Vendor About Your Application. The GPS vendor observed Space Shuttle ascents and entries from Mission Control. Vendor GPS engineers also flew landings in a Space Shuttle simulator and were present in the cockpit of the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory when MAGR\/S testing was performed, and participated in lab tests of the MAGR\/S at Shuttle Program facilities. These activities permitted the vendor to ascertain how the Space Shuttle application differed from aviation users of GPS receivers. These experiences were found to be very helpful in understanding customer concerns and identifying improvements to be made to the receiver. This enabled the vendor to propose solutions to technical issues that were agreeable to the various parties within the project. The vendor became familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of Shuttle Program GPS simulation facilities. This enabled them to provide input to Shuttle integration engineers concerning how best to perform receiver testing and verify MAGR\/S functionality. Talk To Those That Have Used The Product Before. Outside consultants, who do not have a stake in the choice of a particular unit, should be used. Such consultants have \u201chands on experience\u201d with box integrations and can be an important information source concerning their design, integration and use. Consultants who have participated in previous integrations will have knowledge of problems that other users have encountered. Consultants and other users can also provide valuable insight into the rationale and requirements that governed the original design of the unit. This information is invaluable to the integrator for identifying technical, cost and schedule risks associated with a particular navigation unit integration. \u201cPlug And Play\u201d Versus Development. The fact that a unit is in mass production and is a proven product does not mean that its integration into a different vehicle will be a simple, problem free \u201cplug and play\u201d project. A difference in application (such as aviation versus space flight) will result in the manifestation of firmware issues that may not have appeared in the original application. Unique data interfaces used by manned and some unmanned spacecraft avionics may require modification of the unit. Power supply changes and radiation hardening may also have to be performed. Test As Much As You Can. A lack of comprehensive, end-to-end testing has resulted in a number of spacecraft failures. Deep integration of systems makes them more vulnerable to software issues. As navigation systems become more complex and more deeply integrated, software quality and verification become more important. Firmware development schedules driven by \u201ctime to market\u201d pressures and a desire to lower overhead costs (a small group of programmers, short development and test cycles) result in a higher probability of code with bugs. Navigation projects for the Shuttle, ISS and CRV programs reaffirmed the need for rigorous and thorough flight and ground testing. Lab testing using signal generators will not exercise all possible logic paths within a GPS receiver or EGI. Signal generators will not completely duplicate the radio-frequency environment encountered during flight. Receiver anomalies will appear in flight tests that may not manifest during lab testing. Conversely, some anomalies found during lab testing did not occur in flight. Many firmware issues could have been found earlier in the Shuttle GPS project had a thorough ground test program been conducted. A limited number of lab and flight tests to ensure that the box \u201cmeets spec\u201d will not exercise enough of the firmware to find issues. This is particularly important for safety of flight applications involving humans. Vendors tend to perform the minimum amount of lab testing needed to ensure that the unit meets contract specifications. Vendors may not consider flight-testing to be valid if they do not trust the source of \u201ctruth\u201d vectors. Testing should also involve any hardware and software that interfaces with the unit. Thorough off line testing of the unit and proposed algorithms that will interface with it should be performed before committing to specific integration architecture. Once the integration has been performed, thorough testing of navigation unit interaction with the rest of the avionics system is needed. Some firmware issues resulted from the use of aviation GPS receiver algorithms at orbital altitude. However, many of the firmware issues that surfaced during the MAGR\/S and SIGI flight tests were due to basic computer science issues. Firmware issues that do not manifest in aviation applications due to a flight time of minutes or hours can manifest during a much longer space flight. Shuttle program ground and flight-testing of GPS receivers and EGIs has uncovered many firmware issues that may aid the maintenance efforts of other users of similar units. End-to-end testing, over the complete flight profile, is required. For space applications, lab tests lasting days or weeks should be conducted. Use good engineering judgment when dispositioning issues, backed up with ground test and flight data. Instrumentation Port Data Is Needed During Flight and Ground Tests. Instrumentation port data provides invaluable insight into firmware behavior during periods of questionable performance. Vendor input should be solicited concerning what data to collect and how it should be interpreted. Instrumentation port data simplifies and speeds up the identification of firmware problems. Software on data collection platforms (such as laptop computers) must be fully tested, documented and certified. Clear and accurate procedures for laptop operation and troubleshooting are needed. Otherwise, it may be difficult to distinguish GPS receiver problems from problems with the data collection computer. Independent Verification And Validation Is Invaluable. The NASA IV&V contractor played a significant role in the MAGR\/S project. Initial IV&V involvement focused on the integration architecture, ground test, and flight test results. After MAGR\/S certification was postponed (in 1998) and MAGR\/S firmware was made available to the Shuttle Program, IV&V performed an audit of the firmware starting in 1999. The audit was invaluable in the certification process, but should have been conducted much earlier in the MAGR\/S project. To date, over 250 issues (of varying degrees of seriousness) have been identified and dispositioned through the IV&V analysis of the MAGR\/S requirements and firmware. The trend to use NDI avionics containing proprietary software may prevent independent validation and verification of firmware. This is an issue for applications that involve human safety and unmanned applications requiring a high degree of autonomy. The ground and flight test environments will not be able to produce conditions needed to reveal all firmware issues or verify all firmware modifications and fixes. Code audits are needed, both by the vendor and an IV&V organization. Guidelines should be created concerning audit scope and the definition of credible failure scenarios. Lack of an IV&V level firmware audit will result in lingering suspicion about a unit. Conduct Enough Test Flights Before Making Critical Decisions. Initial flights of the 3M receiver (pre-production MAGR) were very successful. Later flights of the MAGR\/S, along with ground testing and firmware audits, uncovered many issues that had to be resolved before the MAGR\/S could be certified for TACAN replacement. It is important not to be lulled into thinking problems are not out there based on a small number of initial, successful test flights. Numerous firmware issues were discovered during the STS-91 flight in June of 1998, resulting in the postponement of MAGR\/S certification for operational use. However, the three TACAN units had already been removed from the orbiter Atlantis and three MAGR\/S had been installed. The Shuttle Program had to remove three string MAGR\/S and reinstall three string TACAN in Atlantis. Design Insight Is Necessary. Inadequate and outdated documentation and a lack of understanding of output parameters make operation, performance analysis and problem resolution difficult. Lack of design insight also complicates risk assessment of firmware issues. A lack of formal procedures for operating the unit in the test (flight and ground) environment results in user errors, which cause schedule slips. Integrators and users have little access to vendor engineers and design documentation. Vendor engineers are often not prepared to answer complex, \u201cspur of the moment\u201d questions at design reviews. Design insight questions require time to research. Trying to obtain design information in the presence of firewalls wastes time and money. Knowledge of product design and operation should not be isolated to a select few. Open and accurate communication is needed. An official questions list should be maintained to record open questions, question status and closure. A lack of configuration-controlled documents can lead to incorrect knowledge about box design, operation and performance. Inadequate understanding of navigation unit design and operation can also lead to misinterpretation of test results. This makes problem resolution more expensive. A lack of accurate, detailed product documentation forces integrators to spend significant amounts of lab time trying to get the unit to work properly. Frequent consultations with the vendor drives up project costs. During a mission, operators of both unmanned and manned spacecraft live by their data. Wrong information can lead to making the wrong decisions when faced with a spacecraft anomaly. This can lead to loss of data, some vehicle capabilities or even the spacecraft itself, as in the 1997 Lewis satellite incident. For a flight critical application (i.e., the box is required to safely conclude the mission), a box will undergo more modification than in other applications. The user will also require more detailed knowledge of navigation unit design and operation than users of non-flight critical units. The Shuttle program considers a box to be failed more quickly than an aviation user. Engineering and Mission Control personnel must have a thorough understanding of receiver operation and data. For manned space flight, lack of design insight is a safety issue. Due to the anomalies that occurred on STS-91, MAGR\/S firmware requirements, the integration guide and source code (originally developed at government expense) were made available to the Shuttle program. Answers to navigation unit insight questions were limited to \u201chow\u201d and often did not include \u201cwhy.\u201d The \u201cwhy\u201d often touched on assumptions made in designing a receiver for terrestrial aviation applications. Assumptions made during the original design can manifest as firmware and receiver performance issues if the assumptions are not valid in the new application of a unit. During the relative GPS experiments conducted on STS-69 and STS-80, lack of insight into the 3M, TurboStar, Tensor and Quadrex receivers made integration, data processing and data analysis more difficult. In addition, lack of insight into algorithms (particularly those associated with clock steering) made development of the laptop based relative GPS navigation filter more challenging. Integration engineers must have access to testing facilities and data so they can become familiar with box performance. As more insight is gained about a unit, the ICD and software requirements for the unit and other units that it interfaces with should be examined for errors and inconsistencies. Pay Attention To \u201cTechnical Risk\u201d. Project management may focus mainly on risk to cost and schedule, with little attention paid to technical risk. GPS project management kept Shuttle Program management well aware of the nature of a \u201csuccess oriented\u201d approach and that cost and schedule could be impacted. Analysis at the start of a project should be conducted to determine risk to cost and schedule based on the technology level, the maturity of the technology and the difference between the planned application and the application for which the box was designed originally. Software complexity should also be examined. Failure to account for technical risk can lead to cost and schedule problems. An additional risk in using \u201coff the shelf\u201d units concerns the availability of the vendor. Can a user continue to use and maintain a product if the vendor goes out of business or stops producing and supporting the product? Coding Practices Used In The Past Still Haunt Users. Many current navigation units use firmware that is descended from systems built over 20 years ago. In the past (and even in the present), good software coding standards were not always used, and were often insufficient. New products tend to be developed quickly, with little effort expended on rigorous requirements definition and documentation. Many navigation system vendors maintain a common library of software modules. Different products share many modules. Cost and schedule considerations may lead integrators, users and vendors to ignore firmware issues, rather than fix them. A firmware problem that is no impact to the user that discovered it may be a \u201cshow stopper\u201d in a different application. This leads to error propagation through a product line. A good example from another program: the Ariane 5 flight 501 launch failure in June of 1996 resulted from the use of code from another launch vehicle. Ariane 4 navigation software was used in the Ariane 5 navigation software. No analysis was performed to determine if the ported code was appropriate for the Ariane 5 application. Several lines of navigation code capable of producing math errors had no protection against such errors. The rationale for not providing error protection was not documented. Furthermore, the launch vehicle computer was not designed to meet any requirements concerning handling and recovery from software errors. Only random hardware errors were taken into consideration. Identify And Resolve Legal Issues Concerning Proprietary Documentation. If a COTS device contains proprietary firmware, legal arrangements must be made to permit inspection of proprietary documentation. Lack of access to proprietary documents can result in undetected issues. One such example, on a civilian spacecraft, was the telemetry bandwidth problem on the European Space Agency Cassini\/Huygens Titan probe. This issue was not discovered until the probe was en route to Saturn. Factors that contributed to the late discovery of the problem were lack of access to proprietary documentation, no \u201cend to end\u201d system testing and a lack of comprehensive project requirements. Maintain Configuration Control Over Test Equipment And Procedures. Perceived anomalous navigation unit performance in the lab is more likely to be caused by improper test equipment configuration and improper procedures, rather than firmware or hardware problems in the box or GPS satellite problems. A lack of accurate, documented test procedures can make it difficult to duplicate questionable performance in later tests. This lengthens the amount of time it takes to determine the cause of suspect behavior. When trying to diagnose questionable performance, an accurate record of what procedures were performed and the test equipment hardware and software configuration is invaluable. Provide The Vendor With As Much Data As Possible. Vendors often complain that users provide minimal data when a problem with a navigation unit occurs. GPS receivers are complex computers whose performance depends on a variety of factors. A plot illustrating questionable position and velocity performance is not enough to permit a vendor to diagnose the true cause of an alleged anomaly. The vendor should be provided with as much digital data as possible, particularly channel and tracking parameters. Information on antenna location, hardware configuration and the procedures that were executed is also helpful. Navigation unit vendors are busy and receive large numbers of \u201ccalls for help\u201d from the user community. Users who suspect that a unit is malfunctioning should make a thorough investigation to determine if the alleged performance is a user error before involving the vendor. COTS Box Outputs May Not Be Designed With Redundancy Management In Mind. Most aircraft and missiles use only one GPS receiver, stand-alone INS or EGI. Some vehicles (Space Shuttle, ISS, X-33, X-38) were designed to use multiple navigation units for redundancy. Redundancy Management schemes perform checks on box outputs, such as dynamic parameters (position, velocity, attitude, rotational rate and accumulated sensed velocity) and health status parameters (BIT\/BITE). Most BIT\/BITE indicators and self-tests were designed to help ground personnel determine if a suspect unit should be returned to the depot for maintenance. Use of BIT\/BITE indicators in RM algorithms requires that the integrator understand what the health status indicators mean and how indications of a problem can affect navigation unit performance. Care must be taken when determining which parameters to monitor for assessing unit health. A \u201ctitle\u201d of what the indicator is in an interface control document does not tell the integrator the potential impact the annunciated condition has on box performance. This makes it difficult for the integrator to determine which BIT\/BITE indications should be used in the RM algorithm. The RM scheme should be robust enough to identify and deselect a questionable unit but not deselect a good unit. BIT\/BITE indicators in navigation units evolve over long periods and have a heritage going back decades to previous products. Particular indicators are often added to help address certain problems encountered. Over the years, corporate knowledge loss results in a manufacturer no longer knowing why a particular indicator is present in the output or what its significance is. Of particular importance are what values performance indicators (such as Figure of Merit) are initialized to after a unit power cycle or re-initialization. Unlike aircraft, the Space Shuttle performs BIT on navigation units during flight. Mission Control must understand how to interpret negative results. Does a certain failure indication from BIT always mean that the unit should not be used? Could the unit continue to be used for navigation with no degradation in performance? Nuisance indicators need to be identified and ignored. A BITE masking capability is particularly useful. While redundancy management is important, it is not a substitute for well-documented and fully verified software. Do Not Totally Rely On The Vendor For Navigation Expertise. Vendors can provide valuable information on the design, integration and use of their products. However, they may not always fully understand the applications where their products are used. Users and integrators must maintain navigation expertise to conduct testing, resolve issues, avoid \u201cfalse pulls\u201d of healthy units that are assumed to be malfunctioning, determine how best to integrate a unit, and provide management with advice on what navigation products are suitable for an upgrade. Navigation vendors, who are doing business in a highly competitive market, do not want skilled technical personnel tied to one project for periods of years. The use of a COTS navigation product should not lead one to believe that technical expertise can be \u201cbought\u201d as a COTS product. The Interface Control Document Is VERY Important. If the integrator and user do not have access to firmware and firmware requirements, the ICD may be the only written source of information on unit parameters. Developers of software that will interface with the unit must examine the ICD closely. The ICD and the interfacing software must be compared to each other throughout a project. The ICD should also be compared to ground and test results to ensure that it accurately reflects unit input, output and operation. An inaccurate ICD will lead to software and procedural issues that will have to be addressed before a system can be certified as operational. An accurate ICD is also needed for instrumentation port data that is critical during the test and verification phase of a project. Understand operation of the box as much as possible before defining requirements for code that will interface with the box. \u201cBullet proof\u201d the interface since it may not be possible to account for all forms of anomalous unit behavior. Some issues encountered on both the MAGR\/S, SIGI and relative GPS projects concerned time homogeneous data. Integrators should confirm with the manufacturer which data messages are or are not time homogeneous. This information should be included in the ICD. Non-time homogeneous data makes data analysis and problem resolution more difficult. Short development schedules may result in changes to the ICD while host vehicle software requirements are being defined and software is in development and test. A disciplined process of checks must be in place to ensure that the ICD and software requirements for units that interface with the GPS receiver or EGI are consistent. Individuals who have knowledge of both receiver or EGI requirements and requirements for other interfacing units must be able to communicate and be involved in any changes made to the ICD. Knowledge Capture. Aviation navigation units often lack detailed, accurate documentation that can be accessed by the integrators and users. If such documentation exists, it is often not included in a contract. The manufacturer may consider some information that would be contained in such documentation proprietary. Much information about unit design and operation possessed by integrators and users is \u201coral tradition\u201d or \u201ctechno-folklore.\u201d Different individuals on a project may have conflicting ideas about how a unit works. This can lead to mistakes during integration and difficulties in resolving anomalies from flight and lab tests. Integrators and users should record information about unit operation and design in a \u201cliving document\u201d as information is learned from testing and interaction with the vendor. Once design and procedural details are on paper, they can be more easily verified and passed on to other personnel later. Such a process facilitates the dissemination of accurate information about the unit. Introduction of proprietary data into the document should be avoided. Document The Theory Behind Navigation Algorithm Requirements. Software requirements documents contain equations to be used, but rarely provide insight into how the equations were derived, or how values of constants were determined. This information exists on paper at some point, in the form of informal memos and company internal letters. However, over time, this information is lost due to employee attrition, clean-out of offices, retirements and corporate takeovers. Many mathematical results used in navigation algorithms do not exist in the open literature. Corporate knowledge loss makes it difficult for engineers to understand, evaluate and modify software years or decades after it was written and certified. Trying to re-derive results can take a considerable amount of time. Theoretical development of algorithms should be contained in a configuration controlled, companion document to the software requirements. The document should be as \u201cself contained\u201d as possible, and avoid references to internal letters, informal memos and presentations that easily become lost over time. Derivations should include all steps and details of simplifying assumptions. The document should be written for a future eng","Lesson ID":1370}

Recommendation: Restructure and re-format the SSC procedures to reduce complexity, ambiguity and to enhance the probability of being understood by technicians and inspectors prior to performing the work. Consider individual planning for unique jobs with the aid of computers and include\/adopt either the KSC or Canoga Park system or elements thereof. Finding: The initial release of a SSC procedure is formally controlled, however, subsequent modifications in the field are not, and the responsibility for establishing the options is unclear. The system relies on redlining and DNAing major sections by technicians, inspectors, engineering, and quality engineering to custom fit the procedure to the specific circumstances at hand. Technicians and inspectors routinely DNA and redline procedures. In some cases, the hardware is not subsequently under the control of the person selecting the DNA option. Recommendation: Procedures should be reviewed and approved by engineering for accuracy and revision as required for the identified task prior to release to the floor. Decisions affecting hardware configuration should be made by engineering in the course of the review; not left up to the floor technicians and inspectors. DNA\/NA options to be exercised on the floor should be limited to those actions where results are immediately verifiable and obvious. DNA\/NA options which require decisions where the results are not under the control of the affected line personnel should be disallowed, and if situation changes, new planning should be issued. A procedure deviation system for initiating deviations to correct errors\/oversights would be helpful. Deviations should be reviewed prior to the use of a procedure. Redlines should be limited to minor pen and ink changes not affecting intent, e.g., typographical errors. Finding: Disciplined implementation of existing procedures was inadequate by floor technicians and quality assurance personnel. Technicians performed five procedural steps in the CCVA procedure (Rework #49) that, if properly accomplished, would have disclosed the missing hardware. The QA inspector stamped four of these five. Three other steps were performed in this procedure that would have possibly disclosed the deficiency. The procedure was clear in these areas and the careful accomplishment of these actions with all parties properly fulfilling their roles would have prevented this problem. Recommendation: Personnel performing operations must fully understand the importance of their tasks and consequences of incorrect action(s). They must understand the significance of their stamps on the planning whereby they certify and agree to the accomplishment\/verification of the specific task(s). Technicians and inspectors should not stamp work they have not personally witnessed. Reinforcement of these responsibilities through additional training\/orientation by supervision appears to be warranted to assure the proper level of discipline is in place. Finding: Performance in accordance with the current procedural system does not assure that the hardware configuration is under control through all phases of disassembly\/reassembly. Recommendation: The procedural control of hardware configuration needs to be addressed and changes instituted to assure the hardware configuration is known and under control at all times. This should apply to the transfer of hardware status from one type of paper to another, to procedures controlling the hardware transfer, storage, issuance, and to the procedures for verifying configuration integrity. Finding: A major SSC planning document deficiency is the absence of a list of parts required to start the job and of parts to be left over after the job. Recommendation: Incorporate in planning a list of required parts and a list of parts to be left after the job. Finding: The existence and location of flight and test hardware on test stand A-1 appears to be uncontrolled. The uninstalled coupling was found on level 5. There was a line assembly on level 5 that belonged on level 8. On level 8, a shim was found that should have been left in building 3202. Recommendation: Institute a system that inventories and controls the location of test and flight hardware on all test stands. A preferred approach would be a centralized location rather than multiple locations. The parts crib should be a controlled access area with an individual responsible for inventory of incoming parts and issue to technicians. Parts should be segregated and identified in the crib in such a manner that they can be unambiguously located and retrieved for a particular job\/engine. Finding: Flight engine 2032 was shipped from building 3202 to the A-1 test stand with a considerable amount of open work and a sizable box approximately 4 X 8 X 4 feet with loose parts. The exact configuration of the engine as shipped was not clearly defined and the absence of parts lists did not force reacting to an unaccounted left-over part like the coupling. Recommendation: Discontinue the practice of shipping flight engines with open work unless the work is related to high pressure pumps. Provide an inventory list of loose parts shipped with the engine and to be installed, and a list of parts to be removed from the engine and centrally collected prior to hot fire testing. Institute a system that reacts to parts left over and unaccounted for. If parts to be installed are shipped separately, they are to be identified on the inventory list not as being in the shipping box but as still to be delivered. A verification system should be in place at the engine position that provides assurance of hardware configuration. Finding: Technicians and inspectors interviewed did not know that the actuator which was to be installed was new and being installed for green run purposes. It appeared that the working people in general are not being briefed as to long term objectives. Recommendation: Establish an information system such that also technicians are aware of long term objectives and not just near term objectives of getting dates, paragraphs stamped off, and the paper closed. Finding: No clear identification of a responsible development engineer having full responsibility for the successful accomplishment of a given task. Recommendation: Assure the clear identification of a lead development engineer and full delineation of his responsibilities for each job. Finding: Integration of Government Agency and contractor procedures is inadequate as evidenced by the existence of conflicting instructions concerning mandatory inspection points. Recommendation: The Government Agency letter dated November 24, 1987, concerning a post activity closed paper review of DNA\/NA operations having a Government Agency review within them should be rescinded.","Lesson ID":1340}

Vendor procedures for cleaning of diaphragm propellant tanks should be carefully reviewed to ensure that adequate quantities of cleaning fluid are being used to ensure the internal surfaces are fully wetted and agitated. Propellant tank cleaning procedures should limit the time the diaphragm is exposed to isopropyl alcohol to no more than 4 hours. Exposure should be followed immediately by vacuum drying of the tank.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Take precautions where any composite materials (such as graphite cyanate ester or epoxy resins) are used in exposed exterior spacecraft surfaces, and where flight electronics or other flight equipment is susceptible to degradation or damage from radiated or otherwise coupled electrostatic discharge (ESD) energy: Use a non-contact charge measuring device when testing the material's electrical resistance under expected mission worst-case space plasma environment conditions. a. Conduct the first test as a measure of resistance in a vacuum, and use an electron beam to characterize the material's surface and in-depth ability to hold an electrical charge. b. If the charge does not bleed away, the material's resistivity is too high for analysis and the material may accumulate a potentially damaging charge in space. If, however, the charge bleeds away in a measurably short time, the material may be characterized and the potential for damage may be analyzed. Results of such testing and analysis may warrant consideration of spacecraft designs that can accept worst-case electrical discharges. This may include pulse filters, the use of alternative materials and coatings, or methods to improve the ESD bleed path on the composite surface.","Lesson ID":1330}
{"Recommendation(s)":"One response to this lesson is, where vulnerabilities have been identified, to deploy radiation hardened solutions. For reflight, PCS will employ a Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM) device for storage of Basic Input Output System (BIOS) application and parameters, a technology that is much less susceptible to Single Event Effects than either CMOS or flash memory technologies. Specifically, the solution being pursued by the Project to reduce the vulnerability of the BIOS is to have the Original Equipment Manufacturer of the original Single Board Computer create a customized BIOS application that will force a boot-up using BIOS parameters stored in Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM) technology. PROM memory technology is far less susceptible to radiation events than either CMOS or flash memory. The PCS BIOS program and the BIOS parameters themselves will be \u201dburned\u201d into a One Time Programmable- Programmable Read-Only Memory (OTP-EPROM) device. Storing all BIOS parameters in OTP-EPROM will then effectively bypass CMOS as a storage location for the PCS startup parameters and also provide a far less susceptible storage location than flash memory for the BIOS application itself.","Lesson ID":1333}

Thus, the secondary vehicle should only be used as a resource to support vehicle number one after other risk mitigation strategies have failed.","Lesson ID":1288}
{"Recommendation(s)":"All test requirements and configurations need to be sufficiently analyzed, the work broken down, and work defined prior to initiation of flight element testing. Test requirements and configurations should be firmly backed up by analysis and testing in order to minimize the impact of unexpected test results. This ensures that the test team has a clear expectation of all results prior to performing the tests. Prior to the initiate of testing, wherever possible, dry runs of the actual tests should be performed. This will minimize problems associated with the actual procedures, test set ups and\/or test equipment. Detailed information as data sampling rates and\/or formatting parameters must be covered in the test procedures. In order to minimize the number of test configurations\/runs, analysis such as Design of Experiments (DOE) should be performed in order to fully understand the worst case configurations and \"boundary conditions\". Unique and\/or representative cases need to be identified prior to the initiation of test planning. These cases can provide an estimate of the test effort and provide a path to facilitate good planning and realistic schedules. In doing so, criteria should be developed for prioritization and screening of candidate test cases. These criteria should focus the development and eventual implementation of detailed test requirements toward key test cases that are the most significant or revealing with respect to the system's performance capabilities and limits. Name a technical \"Test Chief Engineer\" with test experience and a clear knowledge of the purpose of the data being taken. This \"test guru\" can work with the Test Director in expediting the test process and paperwork to expedite the schedule. Because the test chief engineer is ultimately responsible for the verification of the subsystem for this flight element, this positions him to make critical decisions on the need and importance of the test data as well as how it was taken. This type of in-depth knowledge is a key to successful test completion. Consider making available a development test facility that can be quickly configured in an \"identical\" mode to the flight element. This enables off-line troubleshooting of anomalies and\/or unexpected results. All data requirements need to be clearly understood and documented. For example, this particular test required data unique to start-up (transient information) and not just the data from the test run itself (load or initiation information) [Example: power turned on to the loads and the load started, not simply power applied to the loads and thus the input EMI filters charged).] The more elemental tests done at the higher assembly level, the more complex any debugging and problem resolution will be. Tests ideally will be pushed down to the lowest level; if data can be obtained from a load or an individual rack, don't perform the testing on an entire flight element. This accomplishes two things: the performance of the component is established, which in turn minimizes the need for sophisticated trouble shooting and debugging of integrated components at the system level.","Lesson ID":1274}

Adherence to process\/procedures was re-emphasized; Implemented a weekly documentation review for process compliance; Improved \"shakedown\" inspection process and checklist was developed and implemented; Product Assurance performed a procedure review, clarification, and personnel training to ensure process compliance; Conducted thorough process review of engineering change implementation to ensure process is adequate; Added requirement for a dry-fit check where critical thermal interfaces depend on a specific level of clamping force; Reviewed drawing standards with personnel to address the proper use of redline drawings. Confirmed that during the fabrication, assembly and test operations, processes are in place to identify defects and\/or deficiencies that are identified by non-conformance reports. These are evaluated and dispositions determined by Engineering, processed through the Material Review Board (MRB), and finally sold off to inspection during assembly.","Lesson ID":1227}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Provide early definition of both specification tree and document tree hierarchies applicable to the program. (from Center Data Manager: Consider performing the process for requirement compliance and traceability versus document \/ specification authority as separate exercises. For example, if a requirement must be traced to a standard, consider using a parallel traceability matrix or a commercial off the shelf requirements tracing package.)","Lesson ID":1228}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Continue to emphasize to all suppliers the importance of timely reporting of all significant business and organizational changes that could affect Space Shuttle logistics.","Lesson ID":1243}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A-frames should be constrained to a 2.5 to 1 height-to-base ratio which will allow the lifting line to be approximately 11 degrees from vertical before an unsafe condition could occur. A-frame base support devices should be provided for A-frames with wheels to preclude overturn due to the loss of a wheel when lifting its rated load. A-frames should be positioned directly over the object to be lifted with the lifting line vertical, the hoist-to-object attachment vertical, or the sling vertical. Lifts should be performed through the center of gravity of the object to be lifted or lateral movement restraints should be imposed to maintain the lifting line vertical. If the lifted object is to be transported by the A-frame, the center of gravity of the object should be as low as practical and lateral restraints imposed to maintain the lifting line vertical during transport. At no time during the use of A-frames should the lifting line be allowed to get outside of the A-frame base dimensions. A-frames should be marked with their load capacity rating.","Lesson ID":1221}
{"Recommendation(s)":"If threaded inserts of this type must be used, \"condition\" the insert first with a sacrificial bolt of the same type. The sacrificial bolt will cold work the upset thread slightly to help mitigate the probability of galling during repeated use. Lab analysis of this cold working procedure was performed; results are available from the lesson initiator.","Lesson ID":1222}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Accelerate the schedule of penetration exercises to gain greater insights into computer security vulnerabilities; determine if further threat analysis should be conducted; review all vulnerabilities; and ensure that plans are adequately formulated to mitigate these vulnerabilities and that work is proceeding to prevent critical systems from being compromised. Accelerate the schedule for the implementation of triple Data Encryption System (DES).","Lesson ID":1250}
{"Recommendation(s)":"In developing future command procedures, the Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) and other mission support specialist (SE Subsystem Engineering, etc.) should take additional care to ensure that upstream power requirements are met in order to ensure success of hardware command (activation, checkout, test, etc.) activities.","Lesson ID":1219}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Team instruction No. 2A-CET-065 was implemented by the flight 2A team by requiring: procedural coordination between assembly and checkout (A&CO) and test teams; application and removal of tags identifying element hardware and systems configured for test or flight; and sensitizing floor operations monitors, task leaders, and all personnel with access to the flight element to the criticality of maintaining awareness of hardware and systems processing status. Key to this initiative was the highly visible tags, the application and removal of which could only be accomplished under authority of approved WADs and with the concurrence of Quality Assurance representatives. The team instruction referenced above can be viewed and obtained at the Flight 2A FE&S web site at http:\/\/www-ss.ksc.nasa.gov\/flight2a\/ACE\/administrative\/Team_Instructions\/Released\/. Recommend that this or a similar procedure be used during all ISS element processing.","Lesson ID":1224}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The transformer vendor has stopped performing the mechanical stripping operation. To prevent reoccurrence of this problem, the vendor has been instructed to use either thermal or chemical stripping of coil wire. No additional vibration failures occurred after replacing the mechanical stripping process. Stripping of such small wires, regardless of application, should avoid mechanical methods since they have been shown to damage the wire. This process change is particularly recommended for transformer and inductors designed with coil wire between 38 and 32 AWG.","Lesson ID":1226}
{"Recommendation(s)":"After applying final assembly torque, consider applying to all critical connections \"Torque Stripe\" paint that spans the joint between the nut and the adjacent connector surfaces. Then visual inspection of the \"Torque Paint\" will verify final assembly of the critical joints. Subsequent loosening or removal of the nut will be detectable due to the crack in the paint that will result at the joint. If joint is loosened, tag the loosened joint and perhaps remove \"Torque Paint\". Apply new \"Torque Paint\" when joint is fully reassembled. All high-power connections must be thoroughly checked before initially applying power. The Power\/Control Drawer was given a visual inspection before use, however the loose connections were not visible beneath the contactor cover. It should not be assumed that a company experienced with electrical assembly has properly checked all connections.","Lesson ID":1229}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Design Engineering should use a non-welded configuration when close proximity bends are needed. Even though the orbital tube welding process requires only 0.7 inches of straight tubing on both sides of the joint for clamping, approximately 1.5 diameters of straight tubing should be kept between a bend and a weld joint for ovality run-out. This will insure acceptable ovality that, in turn, will insure acceptable mismatch.","Lesson ID":1230}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Maintain the previously planned funding to expeditiously implement the CAU.","Lesson ID":1239}

{"Recommendation(s)":"KSC provides for an overall review and readiness for critical flight tests and component installations referred to as a Test Readiness Review (TRR). Recommend reiterating the written policy, CETI-055, to all Test Director's\/Task Leaders with emphasis placed on procedural deviations. Background: Test Readiness Reviews outline objectives for the Test Director\/Task Leader to provide management an evaluation of the readiness of flight elements, support systems, and test procedures required to accomplish ground processing test objectives and safety of personnel\/hardware.","Lesson ID":1210}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Test Aid Configuration Control a) Identify a KSC Test Conductor with knowledge of the flight hardware. b) Conduct tabletop reviews of all test aid requirements and test procedure documentation with KSC personnel prior to release. c) Structure test procedures so that all crew conducted steps are congregated in one section for efficient accomplishment. Identify specifically on the test timeline and at the crew test pre-brief. d) Release all test aid requirements documents and test procedures prior to TRR. e) Add test aid to flight element configuration drawing as an Appendix to the Test Aid Requirements Document. f) Schedule all reviews and document releases on the element schedules at KSC Use of existing management forums a) Create a checklist of success criteria for the On-Orbit Constraints Meeting. Add checklist to the agenda for all On-Orbit Constraints Meetings. b) Add obstruction dimension and mounting requirements for the OOCT to the Test Aid Requirements Document (TARD) for release. c) Add test aid setup and alignment requirements data to the TARD as an Appendix for release. Integrated configuration control a) Add general warning to the test procedures on protecting flight hardware when overhangs occur. b) Develop a footprint of the test configuration for all tests. c) Add performance of CAD model assessment of the test configurations to identify potential flight hardware safety concerns. d) Add a test configuration assessment of the On-Orbit Constraints meeting and a review of the assessment at the Test Readiness Review. Congency planning for discrepancies to reduce downstream impacts a) Add element and system hardware representatives to the mandatory review of test requirements and test procedure documents. b) Add all subsystem hardware providers to the Test Readiness Review. c) Call out specifically in the test procedure all locations for the application of targets and the procedure by which they are to be applied. d) Include the element managers from both the hardware provider and the program integrator are at the TRR. [Reschedule the TRR if necessary to insure proper attendance. Resolving data conflicts a) All data conflicts should be identified as Test Constraints and identified with resolution at the TRR. Only formal engineering paper should be considered sufficient documentation of resolution and closure not sketches. b) Add all Test Constraints to the TRR agenda as a specific topic. This will act as a second review gate of all issues prior to the start of test.","Lesson ID":1216}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Management needs to clearly delineate responsibilities and appoint one individual to be in charge. This individual must plan and coordinate all activities between personnel involved to ensure no conflicts or hazards arise. Before commencing testing, the software and hardware functions must be checked-out in a manner that does not endanger the test article. In the above case, the test fixture motor(s) should have been physically disconnected (flex coupling removed) prior to check-out of the system functionality. An Uninterruptible Power Supply with proper surge protection is a preferred practice to protect expensive and delicate electronic test equipment from electrical power surge damage. All personnel involved in designing, assembling, handling and testing ISS hardware should know how to \"Murphy\" proof the process. A \"Can Not Fail\" briefing was developed by Boeing-Huntington Beach which addresses two different approaches to maintaining a safe environment during Production and Test.","Lesson ID":1212}
{"Recommendation(s)":"There were no recommendations as the information provided revealed an ongoing series of issues with configuration control. The depth and breadth of this lesson illustrates the need for configuration control at all times across the boundaries of the immediate activity and the need to plan for sharing information with unanticipated customers.","Lesson ID":1213}
{"Recommendation(s)":"This condition was first noted on a qualification test article. When the qualification article was assembled, most Hi-Lite fasteners were installed with the collars facing \"outward\" to ease the mechanics access to the nut element. On subsequent flight units, a concerted effort was made to install fasteners with the collars facing \"in\", greatly reducing potential EMU access to the burr hazard. On collars that cannot be reversed, plans are in place to encapsulate all exposed collars with a sealant compound. This same issue can be attributed to other fastener types (e.g., lockbolt and many types of blind bolts and rivets) as well. Any fastener whose installation involves shearing or breaking off of any element has high potential for leaving a sharp edge or burr.","Lesson ID":1217}
{"Recommendation(s)":"An approval process for packaging plans, which ensures specific plans are developed and utilized for mission critical equipment, should be established. Formal procedures and responsibilities should be established to ensure proper communication of data and requirements from CFE and GFE providers to the receiving facility. A formal process should be established to ensure all effected organizations (i.e., test, manufacturing planning, quality assurance, safety, and shipping\/ receiving\/ packaging) review and concur with the data and requirements from the CFE and GFE providers before the hardware\/ software arrives. Packaging and shipping instructions for mission critical equipment should include all of the required monitoring equipment. They should not depend on the interpretation of requirement documents by receiving organizations to ensure the proper configuration.","Lesson ID":1211}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Several short-term recommendations were considered to mitigate the mishap recurrence. The crane operating procedure has been modified to include a detail list of crane speeds that are to be used when operating within close proximity of flight hardware. The pre-task briefing will reinforce the use of the E-Stop (i.e. Emergency Stop) during operations. The operating procedure will be modified to include a list of all crane crew certifications, including those of relief personnel on the crew. Long term recommendations include development of a process to change out the crane crew that have vigilant type duties more often and keeping the crane operator more involved in the task during dwell times. A study of the crane's cab control panel design will also be conducted to optimize Human Engineering Factors. In addition, a dry run should be considered to ensure that the operator is confident to avoid human errors.","Lesson ID":1215}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Develop a JSC Generic Requirements document for space flight equipment. This standard shall be applied for Criticality 3 (CRIT 3) hardware only and will be jointly approved by the ISSP and SSP. In addition to the JSC Generic Requirements Document, the following \"common hardware\" certification policy will be used to certify previously flown hardware. Any CRIT 3 hardware certified for use that has flown on the Space Shuttle or Mir Space Station and will be used for similar function on the ISS will be acceptable for the ISSP. No additional documentation is required except for the following: Hardware that will use Space Station power (United States on-orbit segment and \/or international partner elements) will have a power quality, and a conducted and radiated emissions certification. Battery-operated hardware will be assessed using existing certification data to assure that Electromagnetic Interference\/Electromagnetic Compatibility are not issues with the ISSP. Hardware launched, used, or stowed in environments outside the experience base will be assessed against existing certification data to assure the difference is not a safety or mission assurance issue","Lesson ID":1207}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Daily status updates should be provided by designated Test Team representatives at specified times as required to meet program needs. This detailed status should be provided external to the control room to minimize disruption to real-time test activities.

This fix has been instituted for the remaining Test Configuration (TC) - 1 testing as is proving to be very effective.","Lesson ID":1206}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For future Flight Operations Reviews (FOR), the ISS S&MA community is aware of this issue and will in the future review the flight operations products (e.g., Operations Checklists, Malfunction Checklists, etc.) with an emphasis on warning\/caution note placement. At no time should a procedural step precede a referenced warning or caution note. ISS MER-Safety routinely checked the Flt 2A.1 (STS-96) Flight Note procedures sent to the crew for placement of warning\/caution notes, as well as their content. Additionally, this lesson learned will be referenced in PRACA PR# 1000 as part of the Recurrence Control. It is believed that placing a procedure step before a referenced warning\/caution note is a rare oversight and that increased ISS Program visibility of such an occurrence via the PRACA Report and the Lessons Learned should adequately address the problem.","Lesson ID":1204}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Kennedy Space Center (KSC) problem report SS-GA1-01-324-P001 (CFN04), corrected the problem by removing all the rivet collars from the PAF (S\/N 002) panels. Huntsville PAF design team has placed a stop work order on the remaining two PAF sets (S\/N 001 & 003) in order to correct the problem at the manufacturer. At this time, the fix appears to be by replacing the PAF rivets with equivalent collarless rivets. This lesson points out the importance of design and use of any hardware that interfaces with ISS flight hardware.","Lesson ID":1205}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The mechanical bonding of the heatsink to the printed wiring assembly results in a unitized structure, providing the components with the support necessary to prevent the reported damage. The elimination of unapproved tooling and processes ensures that electronic components will not possess latent damage that would result in reduced reliability.","Lesson ID":1202}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Be prepared to assess and make procedural adjustments in response to multicultural considerations.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Prepare, review, and approve (including QA) written test plans (when appropriate) and test procedures for all tests involving critical hardware prior to test. Strictly observe connector safe-to-mate practices, including continuity and shorting checks, before cables (flight or GSE) are initially connected to critical hardware. Prior to testing, review the OSS, and without exception complete all OSS action items. QA should witness the setup for testing and witness first item testing of all critical hardware. Perform comprehensive functional checks after completion of testing the first item, and after all subsequent testing of identical critical hardware (especially as a final gate prior to delivery of this hardware).","Lesson ID":1201}
{"Recommendation(s)":"To minimize the likelihood of personnel injury and flight hardware damage, some crane hardware replacements and procedural changes have been implemented. The metadyne in use on the night of the close call and other selected crane components have been replaced. A new commutator cleaning procedure relating to the brushes and debris removal has been implemented. Operator awareness and engineering involvement in any off-nominal crane performance have been increased and operating rules regarding speed selection have been enhanced. The new procedures reduce the likelihood of a recurrence, but some residual risk remains. The crane operator did not stop operations and report the unexpected trolley speed increase. All anomalies should be reported. Shift turnover briefings are especially important to communicate anomalous or unusual conditions. Continued use of the VAB cranes as presently equipped should be with extreme caution. The Board recommends that the new solid state control system being evaluated to replace the metadyne be expedited for immediate implementation on the 250 and 175 ton cranes with special attention to proper control system relay contact selection.","Lesson ID":1187}
{"Recommendation(s)":"To fully validate performance, test integrated software and hardware over the flight operational temperature range.","Lesson ID":1197}
{"Recommendation(s)":"As the interim corrective action, the manufacturer and investigative team have determined that the risk of fire can be reduced significantly if the current available in a short circuit situation can be limited. Since the booster power supplies are wired in parallel with the main power supplies, disconnecting the booster connected to power supplies with the flawed boards have the effect of reducing the shorted current from over 10 amps to near 5 amps. As indicated previously, over 6 amps are required to initiate a fire. The booster supplies remained disconnected until the permanent corrective action was complete. As the permanent corrective action, the flawed boards were replaced with the most recent revision level from the manufacturer.","Lesson ID":1188}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For developments funded by NASA, the contract should ensure that the work performed does not result in proprietary information.

For systems that use previously developed proprietary information, the contract should ensure that NASA has the right to inspect, discuss, and verify all designs, analysis, and test results.","Lesson ID":1190}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Spacecraft processing lightning policies should be addressed as a specific agenda item during early Ground Operations Working Group Meetings. The spacecraft and launch vehicle community should clearly define their plans and expectations for not only launch countdown operations, but for all PPF and Pad operations as well. An early exchange of information may identify technical drivers, which may ultimately influence the policy, and guarantees that the community is fully aware of possible operational impacts.","Lesson ID":1194}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Avoid staffing flight projects with individuals having no backups. During up front planning, build in human redundancy, and provide checks and balances for technical decision-making. Where it is not feasible to provide for backup personnel on key assignments, ensure that \"single-string\" individuals: 1) document and assure accessibility of the rationale for important decisions, and 2) inform peers and line management of these decisions. 3. Report any \"single-string\" staffing approach as a risk item at major project reviews. Identify potential backups anywhere in the organization.","Lesson ID":1195}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Enforce the system-level test principle of \"test as you fly, and fly as you test.\" Carefully assess any planned violations of this principle; if they are necessary, take alternate measures such as independent validation. Departures from this principle must be reflected in the project risk management plan, communicated to senior management for concurrence, and reported at reviews. When using simulations for system-level verification, models must have been validated (e.g., supported by test); and sufficient parametric variations in the simulations must be performed to ensure that adequate margins exist.","Lesson ID":1196}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Communication System: Frame Control: The existing Frames Status Indicators should be utilized for Frame access control in all facilities that have critical or hazardous systems in operation. Frame Access control should be coordinated with Facility Management and potentially affected systems should be safed prior to Frame access. Critical Functions: All critical or hazardous functions routed through the Comm. system should be appropriately identified and protected. Documentation: Formal documentation of troubleshooting procedures should be required when work involves critical or hazardous systems or is accomplished in the vicinity of them. Water Deluge System: Documentation: Systems drawings should be updated and audited to verify accuracy and completeness. Control lines: Control functions which require an OPEN\/CLOSED path between two wires should be designed and implemented such that exposed terminals are non-adjacent and are adequately protected. If possible separate wires should be utilized, not a twisted pair. Routing: control lines for \"ARM & ACTIVATE\" values and other critical functions should not be routed through uncontrolled TDs and Frames along with other miscellaneous systems Monitoring: Control logic should be designed such that traceability is provided to indicate how the system was activated. (i.e. which pushbutton). Verification: Examine all Water Deluge Systems and identify those with conditions similar to the PHSF system so that appropriate action can be taken.

{"Recommendation(s)":"FINDINGS, OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PRIMARY CAUSE: Avionics Bay Platform Beam Assembly was left in the Aft Compartment of OV-104. Other work unrelated to platform removal and Aft Closeout had been scheduled for the Aft Compartment during the same period as platform removal and Aft Closeout. This unrelated work required that the entry platforms inside the 50-1 and 50-2 doors remain in place. The unrelated jobs contributed to an excessive man loading in the Aft Compartment, as did some OJT by NASA QC. The beam could not physically be removed from the Aft with the entry platforms still in place. Therefore, the beam was temporarily positioned against the 1307 bulkhead forward of Avionics Bay 6, awaiting removal of the entry platforms. When the entry platforms were removed, approximately 40 minutes later, the platform removal crew had forgotten about the beam. RECOMMENDATIONS All unrelated work should be completed before performing platform removal. Limit personnel access to the Aft Compartment to minimum essential personnel required to perform platform removal and Aft Closeout. Judiciously control OJT man loading. CONTRIBUTORY FINDING #1 The platform removal crew made a mistake in verifying the removal of the bean assembly from the Aft. The other half of the platform removal crew conducted a platform component inventory outside the vehicle on the floor near the Aft shop area. They checked the platform component numbers against a handwritten inventory list contained in the job card. They mistakenly checked off the bean as having been removed from the Aft when it was actually still in the Aft Compartment. Their task was made more difficult because of problems with the job card and the components. For example, the listing of part numbers in the job card matrix (inventory list) is not done in any logical sequence of sub-grouping. the part numbers are hand-written.on the matrix when they are installed in the Aft compartment. RECOMMENDATIONS Develop a bar coding process for the individual subassembly components in this GSE platform set. Group subassembly part numbers by zonal locations. Pre-print the subassembly part numbers on the job card sheets. CONTRIBUTORY FINDING #2 The final visual inspection of the Aft Compartment did not result in the beam being discovered. The final visual inspection to verify platform set removal was done by two technicians in the platform removal crew from the 50-1 door. They did not enter the Aft Compartment and failed to look at the area in which the beam had been repositioned and missed seeing it. All of the platform subassemblies, except the beam, had been removed. As the platforms were being removed, the portable lights were also being removed, leaving a darkened interior. The crew used a. stick light and flashlight to inspect the interior by observing from outside the Aft Compartment. RECOMMENDATIONS A method for providing improved lighting for the final visual inspection of the Aft interior must be developed. The final visual inspection to verify that all platform items have been removed from the Aft should be done by Quality. Use the platform set ladder to allow safe access to the Aft Compartment after all platforms have been removed. CONTRIBUTORY FINDING #3 The LSOC and NASA inspectors performing the Aft Closeout inspection failed to back-stamp the Aft Compartment zones which contained the beam assembly. The LSOC and NASA inspectors performing the Aft Closeout inspection were aware of the beam assembly positioned in their zonal area of inspection. Since they were assured that the beam assembly was going to be removed, they elected not to back-stamp their Aft Closeout Job Card to show that the beam remained in their zonal area of inspection. The backstamp notation would have prompted the inspectors to check on beam assembly removal before being able to complete their job card and Aft Closeout. The LSOC and NASA inspectors also did not ensure that OMI V6003 was available as a reference document during their inspections. The inspectors did not feel the need for the reference OMI because it repeated inspection criteria which they follow in their daily inspections and had committed to memory. If they had referred to V6003, Sequence 48?001, they would have been reminded of their responsibility for both GSE platform removal verification and flight hardware inspection. RECOMMENDATIONS Reinforce the usage of the back?stamp procedure by Quality inspectors. Reinforce the requirement for reference documentation to be on site or readily available to the aft closeout inspectors. Reinforce the Aft Closeout inspectors' total responsibility for both flight hardware inspection and GSE platform removal verification. Update Job Card V35-10010 to require LSOC and NASA Quality to verify visually by internal inspection inside the Aft Compartment that all platforms have been removed. Delete the word \"temporary\" when referring to the Aft Closeout within the job card. Publish an SPC Safety Lessons Learned bulletin to all employees. CONTRIBUTORY FINDING #4 There was no single person in charge of the integrated operation. A Pre-Task Briefing was not conducted for the combined effort (platform removal, aft closeout inspection and aft door installation). The job cards for GSE platform removal, aft closeout inspection and GSE door installation are all independently worked operations. The j ob cards replaced OMI-V1032. There was no KICS integrated mini-schedule published for the Aft Closeout effort. The job card for GSE door installation is generic and does not define requirements for unique move operations. Communication to personnel performing overall aft closeout functions were vague, with no apparent single leadership. RECOMMENDATIONS Develop an integrated aft closeout OMI with a control sequence to provide a single person in charge of the integrated operation. Assign single?point responsibility and accountability to significant processing events. Revise the GSE door installation job card to verify that all supporting Work Authorization Documents (WADs) are complete before giving an okay to install the doors. Conduct individual and combined Pre?Task Briefings. Provide integrated mini-schedules for all Aft Closeout operations. OBSERVATION #1 Part number on bean was different than Platform Removal Job Card matrix illustration. Cause: Typo error on sketch. RECOMMENDATION: Correct platform matrix Job Card. OBSERVATION #2 Fatigue, work hours, schedule pressure and experience did not influence events.","Lesson ID":1199}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Primary Cause Finding: Aft movement of Bridge 9A of the Payload Bay Area Bridge and Bucket Hoist System with the Payload Bay Door Zero-G Simulator connected (right side only) caused the improper raising of Orbiter 103's (OV-103) right payload bay door (PLBD). Contributing Causes: The operator of bridge 9A, in support of TPS No. VTCS-3-11-138, TCS Blanket Rework - Aft Bulkhead, failed to follow the approved procedure covering bridge\/bucket operations (OMI V3575, OPF PLB Access Bridge\/Bucket System) as follows: A) A thorough walkdown\/inspection of bridge 9A was not performed per sequences 03 and 04 of OMI V3575 to verify Zero-G Simulator was not connected. Appendix A checklist only was used to checkout the bridge\/bucket system. B) A bridge\/bucket observer was not assigned. Recommendation: Delete Appendix A checklist and require use of OMI V3575 applicable sequences for bridge\/bucket checkout and operation. Control systems utilized by Shuttle Processing Contract (SPC) to preclude bridge operation while connected to the Zero-G Simulator were deficient as follows: A) Control of the bridge\/bucket keys was nonexistent. The technician had virtually free access to the keys. B) No provision is set forth in OMI V9023 (Orbiter Payload Bay Door Operations - Horizontal\/Vertical) to tag bridge\/bucket system out of service and secure the key during Zero-G operations per OMI V3575 requirements. C) Shift tie-in from third shift Mechanical\/Electrical\/TCS Supervisor to first shift Electrical\/TCS Supervisor did not occur. Supervisor was not aware of scheduled PLBD operations status nor did he perform a complete walkdown. Therefore, the supervisor assigning TPS No. VTCS-3-11-138 was not aware the Zero-G System was connected. Recommendation: SP-?018(2)K IOPF Payload Bay Access Equipment (Buckets) Operation and Control and OPF Fixed Platform Movement Control}, paragraph 6.1.1.b, which provides for specific key control, should be enforced. Recommendation: OMI V3575 steps to tag bridge\/bucket system out of service and secure keys during Zero-G operations should be incorporated into OMI V9023. Recommendation: SPC OPF management needs to formalize and enforce third to first shift tie-in. A formal end of shift tie-in needs to be established. Recommendation: The sustaining engineering design organization should incorporate a positive, actively controlled lockout device to prevent improper operation of the bridge system while the Zero-G Simulator is connected. TPS VTCS-3-11-138 did not appear on the OPF shop schedule or the KSC Integrated Control Schedule (KICS) for June 4, 1990. This TPS was in response to MCR No. 14725 and should have been scheduled through the KICS system. Had TPS VTCS-3-11-138 been properly integrated into the KICS schedule, work involving bridge movement would have been scheduled to occur after use of the Zero-G Simulator was complete. Recommendation: All OPF shop work (non-hazardous) should be fully integrated with the KICS. OBSERVATIONS Keys for both forward and aft bridge\/buckets are fully interchangeable. Interchangeability of keys compounds the key control issue in another finding. Recommendation: Bridge control key locks should be recoded to provide unique key control (1 key) for each bridge in both high bays. Secondary keys should be maintained by the Orbiter Processing Chief (OPC). Hands-on training for firs-?time operator certifications for the bridge\/bucket system is performed while Orbiters are in the high bays. This practice increases flight hardware exposure to possible damage. Recommendation: Schedule hands on training during periods when high bays are empty. Create a stand-alone OMI to support this training process. The constraints log kept with the out-of-TAIR OMI V3575 in the mechanical mid-body shop area book may not contain the complete list of open Problem Reports (PR's) due to the time lag to annotate constraints from the bridge\/bucket TAIR book to the mid-body book. In addition, there is no official method for recording other operational constraints against OMI V3575. Recommendation: SPC should develop a system to ensure all applicable PRIs and operational constraints are recorded against OMI V3575 in a timely manner. QC personnel, both NASA and SPC, do not receive any formal training on the operation of or hazards associated with the bridge\/bucket system. Recommendation: Provide QC personnel with a familiarization course on bridge\/bucket operations and hazards. Training of such personnel could enhance the check and balance system by providing additional awareness of the hazards associated with improper operation and checkout of the bridge\/bucket system. Technical training given for bridge\/bucket operations appears to be generally adequate. However, based on interviews with operators, there are different interpretations of the significance of finding the bridge inhibit switch on. Recommendation: Training should emphasize that finding the inhibit switch on.should prompt the operator to find out why this switch was left on prior to operating the bridge (e.g., steps in OMI V9023 require inhibit switches to be turned on after the Zero-G System is connected). OMI V3575 should be revised to instruct the operator what to do when inhibit switches are found on. The training instructor for bridge\/bucket operations is not on distribution for OMI V3575 revisions or deviations. Recommendation: The training instructor should ensure that he receives the latest OMI V3575 revision\/deviations to ensure training material is consistent with current operating procedures. There are common\/similar findings between this mishap and the 1985 bridge\/bucket mishap. These finds are: A) inadequate bridge key control, B) Inadequate bridge tag-out (out of service) procedures, and C) Deficient shift-to-shift tie-in communications. There are 86 bridge\/bucket certified operators. This appears to be excessive number to support OPF operations. Recommendation: SPC should reassess and justify the need for the number of certified operators with a view towards elimination of \"incidental\" operators. The Preliminary Evaluation Report (PER) did not address damage to flight hardware even though it was stated on the PER that the Payload Bay Door lifted approximately 10 to 12 inches. Recommendation: Even if there is no obvious damage to flight hardware that has been involved in a Mishap\/Incident, it should be included in item number ten (Equipment Damaged) on the PER. The PER should be revised to include a block for flight hardware that could possibly be damaged. The initial estimate in item ten will then be a TBD until the flight hardware can be examined. SPC OPF Supervision, as evidenced by interviews, are not generally aware of the NASA\/KSC mishap investigation process per KHB 1711.lC,\"Reporting and Investigation of Mishaps.\" In addition, the SPC SPI SF-505(8)KV, Rev. C-1, \"Mishap Reporting,\" lacks specificity on the mishap investigation process. This lack of awareness and specificity led to: A) A SPC Mishap Investigation Team was established June 4, 1990, by the Director of OPF\/HMF\/VAB Shops outside of the authority of Launch Site Directive 002, \"Standing Accident Investigation Boards.\" An informal LSOC Assessment Team was subsequently established by a letter from the Launch Site Director on June 5, 1990. B) Incomplete communications to and within the SPC flow management organization permitted mishap-related, failed hardware to be removed without the SPC Mishap Investigation Team Chairman's approval. Recommendation: Revise SPI SF-505(8)KV to provide SPC personnel a more detailed guide to follow during a mishap investigation process. A review of SAA09FY093-006, \"System Assurance Analysis of the Payload Bay Area Access Bridge at the Orbiter Processing Facility High Bay 1 and 2,\" Section 4, \"Hazards Analysis,\" reveals there are ten controlled hazards in this system. The primary risk acceptance rationale for control of these hazards involves procedural checks, inspections, warning notes, and testing principally via OMI V3508 (now V3575). In light of this mishap and the 1985 bucket mishap findings, the hazard control verification aspects of OMI V3575 are not being implemented as fully or rigorously as envisioned in the SAA. Recommendation: SAA09FY093-006 should be revisited and acceptability of the controlled risk rationale and verification method via OMI V3575 reassessed. On Friday, June 22, 1990, a \"near miss\" incident involving bridge\/bucket checkout per OMI V3575 was recorded. During the forward\/aft motion check of OPF-1 aft bridge\/bucket 9A per OMI V3575, the right-hand Zero-G counterweight basket lifting pulley and mount bracket came close to striking a workstand that extended into the bridge path. The Problem Report (PR) for which the workstand was being used (PRC70-00-002-0026) was not listed as a constraint against OMI V3575.","Lesson ID":1200}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Provide a means to assure there is no source or path of electrical connections to allow a sneak circuit between the payload power source or other external electrical power supply to the 2.75 FFAR igniter. Also, power transfer above 1.5V DC should usually be done remotely. Do not use the fins as part of an electrical grounding circuit, unless provision is made to assure adequate electrical connections. Redesign the arming device to provide electrical isolation from the battery and connect to the withdrawal piston with a non conductive lanyard. Review and amend the 2.75 FFAR procedure to assure that it meets NASA, KSC requirements such as those outlined in KMI 1710.13 and other supporting documents. Revise the 2.75 FFAR procedure to require the down range impact area and air space be secured and cleared of all unauthorized personnel and aircraft before loading and preparing the 2.75 FFAR's and their payloads. Revise the 2.75 FFAR procedure to require a safety professional\/observer to be on site during all hazardous operations. Redesign the launcher assembly to use insulating devices between dissimilar metals, or use materials that are compatible. Revise the procedure to indicate the required control\/clear area and show the man loading charts that identify the personnel required to perform the hazardous steps\/task. During the pre task\/test briefing personnel must be reminded of the necessity to discharge any potential of static buildup within their body\/clothing just before handling ordnance (regardless of the humidity levels). Use leg stats\/wrist stats as required. Personnel should use the proper equipment. The use of the work stand would have minimized, if not eliminated the injury received during the inadvertent launch. When any change to the procedure is needed, a written deviation or waiver must be signed and approved as required by KMI 1710.13.","Lesson ID":1185}
{"Recommendation(s)":"PRIMARY CAUSE: Fuel Cells 2 and 3 were not isolated from orbiter main busses when commanded. The emergency power down procedure did not address the loss of multiple fuel cells with no vehicle ground power and therefore did not accomplish the required safing. RECOMMENDATION: Review emergency power down procedures to assure that fuel cell failures are appropriately addressed Review should consider: Precautionary note regarding sequence of fuel cell removal from busses; Use of crew module panel indicators as part of configuration verification; and Precautionary note regarding possibility of invalid data. CONTRIBUTING CAUSE: Sudden performance degradation of Fuel Cells 2 and 3 as a result of helium ingestion into the 02 supply caused the loss of Main Busses B and C. Helium was ingested via the oxygen horizontal drain disconnect as a result of an inadequate test procedure. The pressure specified in the test procedure for the GSE Back Pressure Regulator (BPR) exceeded the orbiter pressure allowing GSE helium to enter the fuel cell 02 supply. RECOMMENDATIONS: Consider a positive means to isolate GSE from vehicle during GSE pressure testing. Review OMI V1091, \"Orbiter PRSD Cryo Drain\" to: Maintain GSE helium pressure below vehicle reactant pressure when fuel cells are operating. Include caution note prior to GSE pressurization steps. Record vehicle pressure at appropriate locations. Alert electrical power distribution (EPD) and other appropriate systems of critical fuel cell operations. OBSERVATIONS: 1) The PRSD\/FC Engineer, aware of vehicle pressure, attempted to limit Oxygen Horizontal Drain (OHD) pressure during the Back Pressure Regulator (BPR) adjustment by cycling GSE supply valves instead of initiating a procedural deviation. RECOMMENDATION: Engineers should be cautioned to critically evaluate borderline conditions. 2) Due to the obscure nature of the failure, the problem analysis did not recognize that Fuel Cells 2 and 3 were still connected to main busses after power down. RECOMMENDATION: Vehicle configuration should be carefully verified after recovery from emergencies or anomalous conditions. 3) While aware of the need to prevent helium ingestion, the PRSD\/FC Engineer assumed pressure instrumentation was adequate to indicate presence of helium in quantities harmful to fuel cell performance. RECOMMENDATION: Re-emphasize to PRSD\/FC operators the sensitivity of fuel cells to any helium ingestion. Evaluate the use of vehicle instrumentation that is more responsive to fuel cell performance changes. 4) Vehicle data stopped updating prior to vehicle power down. Most test team members were unaware of vehicle data loss and that the motor switches did not open. RECOMMENDATION: Consider implementation of an obvious flag\/color change within data display system to indicate data has stopped updating. 5) When fuel cells are operating without ground power, flight hardware is vulnerable to GSE activities. RECOMMENDATION: Review operations and GSE design to minimize times when fuel cells are operating without redundant ground power. 6) Although not referenced in the OMI, the PRSD\/FC engineer relied upon a 20 PSID operating specification value for the horizontal drain flight poppet to prevent flow into the orbiter. RECOMMENDATION: Instruct engineers not to use delta pressure across system components in determining safe GSE to vehicle pressure margins. 7) Orbiter fire alarm activation (due to low bus voltage) provided false clues to the nature of the problem. RECOMMENDATION: Alert test team of this condition.","Lesson ID":1184}
{"Recommendation(s)":"PRIMARY CAUSE - THE HYDROGEN (H2) PURGE VENT PORT ON ORBITER OV-104 WAS CAPPED. Finding 1: The H2 purge vent port was capped although there were no steps in OMI V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3 to cap the vent. Recommendation: An alert should be widely circulated to all technicians and quality inspectors emphasizing the criticality of rigorously following procedures. The alert should include the necessity to obtain a deviation to the work document to perform any work (including usual shop practices that alter configuration of the vehicle or ground support equipment [GSE] not specifically identified in the OMI. Finding 2: None of the personnel involved (two mechanical technicians and a quality inspector) were aware of the criticality of the H2 purge vent port remaining clear and open at all times. Recommendation: Precautionary notes should be included in OMI V1093 relative to not capping critical vents that must remain clear and open. All OMI's should be reviewed to identify such vents and appropriate precautionary notes incorporated. Placards should be utilized on the vehicle to identify critical vents that must remain clear and open. Finding 3: System training and certification relative thereto are not required for technicians or quality inspectors working on the Orbiter. Recommendation: System training and knowledge should be made part of certification requirements for all technicians and quality inspectors and should be one of the primary considerations for pay increases and promotions. System training should be made available during off-shift hours. A systematic review of all training and certification requirements should be accomplished across the contractor organization. Currency and proficiency training should be a major consideration. Finding 4: The two mechanical technicians and the quality inspector assigned to perform OMI V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3 had no previous on-the-job training or experience performing this task. Recommendation: Technicians and quality inspectors should not be assigned to a task they have not previously performed without the supervision of a system engineer, supervisor, or another experienced technician who has performed the task. Finding 5: With the exception of the part number, the nomenclature on the \"bulkhead\" fitting did not agree with the nomenclature in the OMI. Recommendation: Orbiter and GSE displayed nomenclature should be reviewed to ensure it is consistent with the OMI's. Finding 6: Operation and maintenance instructions are reviewed and approved by several organizations\/contractors. This review and approval process involves system engineering, quality engineering, and safety. After engineering approval, portions of the OMI's are handed over to the technicians to perform without any requirement for further engineering involvement or direction. Recommendation: Station system engineering personnel in the OPF to witness and direct the conduct of their respective OMI's. CONTRIBUTING CAUSE: FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE THE LACK OF H2 FLOW AND TO GENERATE AN INTERIM PROBLEM REPORT (IPR). Finding 7: The second shift fuel cell system engineer did not prepare an IPR for either of the anomalies, i.e., the failure of the 02 reactant valve to close on command and the lack of H2 flow with the H2 reactant valve closed and the purge valve open. Recommendation: Re-emphasize to engineers that IPR's must be prepared and documented real time for all anomalous conditions. OBSERVATIONS 1: The midbody mechanical supervisor and lead mechanical technician were off work the night of the mishap. The midbody lead electrical technician was supervising the mechanical technicians. He was not familiar with the capabilities of the personnel or the task being performed. Recommendation: In the absence of a discipline supervisor and lead technician, supervision should be delegated to the next senior technician within that discipline on the shift. The delegation and chain of command should be clearly understood. 2: On March 19, during OMI V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3 on Orbiter Columbia, OV-102 (OPF High Bay 1), the H2 purge vent port was also capped. An experienced technician sent to review the work found the purge vent port capped and directed the cap be removed. The incident was reported to the supervisor but there was no shop-wide awareness. The inadvertent capping was neither discussed at \"tailgate\" meetings nor were engineering and quality notified. Recommendation: Any improper performance of an OMI step should be documented and generate a review of that OMI by the shop supervisor, engineering, and quality to determine if the document needs to be revised. When improper work practices are discovered an alert should be generated and circulated within the technician, engineering, and quality organizations. These alerts should be discussed at weekly \"tailgate\" meetings. Engineers should attend technician \"tailgate\" meetings to discuss system issues or problems related to processing which are of interest to both groups. 3: A walkdown of the area was not performed prior to fuel cell venting. Recommendation: A walkdown should be performed by engineers in the OPF prior to initiating an OMI, significant tasks, or subsequent to configuration changes affecting future work. Walkdowns should be accomplished in a timely manner for the OMI steps to be performed. 4: Deviation 37-01 was not logged at the work control station and the first fuel cell venting was attempted per OMI V5RO1, step 37-005. Two active work authorization documents (WAD's) existed at the beginning of first shift, April 4, to vent the fuel cell (PR PV6-156255 and OMI V5RO1, step 37-005). The fuel cell system engineers on first and second shift, respectively, each worked the venting procedure on different WAD's. Recommendation: Deviations generated to WAD's must be logged into work control as they are generated in order to ensure work is accomplished in accordance with current and authorized procedures. The need for a coordinated work plan between shifts should be re-emphasized to all personnel. 5: Quality inspectors are assigned work on an indiscriminate basis by a call board system. Recommendation: A quality supervisor should assign work to quality inspectors based on their experience and knowledge. 6: The remote location of the control rooms in the Launch Control Center (LCC) some distance from the OPF creates a natural barrier between engineering and technicians making communications and observation of work difficult. Recommendation: When new control rooms are provided they should be located within the orbiter processing facilities. 7: There is not an effective procedure to identify the constraints open grounds will have on systems. Recommendation: A procedure should be established to notify system engineers that removal of electrical grounds will be a constraint to testing. 8: Engineering log books are extremely important in the shift turnover communication process. They are sometimes hard to follow. Recommendation: Emphasize to engineers the need to keep log books neat and orderly and to highlight anomalies. 9. The NASA\/JSC engineers (the design center) reviewed all the vehicle OMI's for XSC checkout after the Challenger accident. The Presidential Commission recommended the design centers become involved in the review of operating and maintenance instructions utilized at KSC. Design center participation, including concurrence in changes affecting Criticality 1 and 1R items, was also directed by the Associate Administrator for Space Flight's letter of March 24, 1986, Strategy for Safely Returning the Space Shuttle to Flight Status. NASA\/JSC concurred in the OMI process until approximately one year ago. An agreement was then made with KSC that JSC would no longer concur on the OMI's or changes thereto. A KSC contractor has been concurring as the design center's representative and is responsible for coordination with the Orbiter subsystem managers at JSC. Recommendation: The NASA\/JSC subsystem managers should review all OMI's for compliance with the Orbiter Maintenance Requirements and Specification Document (OMRSD) and for clarity. There should be provisions for the subsystem managers to review all OMI's and changes thereto on a periodic basis. NASA\/KSC engineering should validate all OMI's to ensure clarity and that they are sufficiently definitive for utilization by operating personnel. They should also be reviewed for compatibility with good shop practices. 10. NASA\/JSC subsystem managers do not generally review contractor training material. Recommendation: The NASA\/JSC subsystem managers and flight controllers working with NASA\/KSC engineering should review all Lockheed KSC training courses for engineers, technicians, and quality personnel, relative to their respective subsystems, for accuracy and adequacy. 11. System training material is not effectively shared between KSC and the design centers. Recommendation: A joint training group with representation from all centers should be organized to ensure the effective sharing of material and resources between JSC, KSC, MSFC, and Stennis. 12: Observation Training is not identified as a major function within the contractor organization. At the Johnson Space Center, 183 civil service and contractor personnel are assigned to an organization devoted exclusively to Shuttle training. They are responsible for training approximately 550 personnel per year. The number of people assigned to Shuttle and Ground Support Engineering, Orbiter Processing and Shops, and SRM&QA within the contractor organization totals approximately 2500 personnel. Training for these 2500 personnel is provided by the contractor training organization (a part of Logistics) totaling 41 people. Training should be and will be a major activity throughout the life of the Space Shuttle Program at KSC. Recommendation: Training should be designated as a separate and major functional entity at the same level as the engineering, operations, logistics, and quality groups within the contractor organization.","Lesson ID":1182}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Emphasize to all individuals involved in the work task that proper procedure execution is mandatory. Access to the OPF deluge system Zones 1 through 6 should be positively controlled (e.g., a lock and key arrangement). Personnel with access should be fully trained and certified in the operation of the system. A policy should be developed outlining which operations\/ activities require PTBS. This policy should be rigorously implemented when developed. As part of the reassessment of the use of this system, all control panels should be properly labeled. A positive position for open versus closed should be readily visible on all valves. The manual arming and firing valves should be oriented to the industry norm and provided with specific open and closed position markings. Access to OPF deluge system Zones 1 through 6 should be positively controlled (e.g., a lock and key arrangement). Personnel with access should be fully trained and certified in the operation of the system. The policy of free access to the water deluge control panel key should be reviewed. Evaluate the risk of inadvertent OPF deluge system water flow with the current system design. The water deluge system valve repair task was not observed by Engineering, which could have prevented the deviation to written procedure by the facility water technicians. When malfunctions on critical facility\/GSE systems occur which could affect flight hardware, a clear policy is required that outlines what level of management approval is needed to initiate repairs. The OPF area warning system should be split between Bay 1 and Bay 2, enabling the NTD to only evacuate one OPF bay when the emergency does not warrant evacuating both bays. Non-redundant GSE should be identified, and workarounds developed if this GSE is destroyed or incapacitated for an extended period of time.","Lesson ID":1183}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Recommend that all personnel that may be involved in integration and test operations be notified whenever any change of configuration is made to equipment.","Lesson ID":1179}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The Systems Engineering activity should, as part of the Systems Requirements Review, conduct a thorough review of all derived requirements, including interfaces, to establish that all requirements are identified, documented, and have been included in the verification process. During the proposal and initial design phases of the project, carefully and thoroughly evaluate the heritage and prior application of the technology. In this case, the sunshield had been used in prior applications, but not with microstrip patch antenna elements. During the Integration and test phases of the project, test the entire system in the final flight configuration. In this case the concern was focused on the RF loss of the sunshield rather than the dielectric loading impact. Examine in detail all analyses of the on-orbit environment impact on the system. Not all aspects of the environment are easily simulated or tested (e.g. solar input, high energy plasma, etc) and verification of performance rests with the completeness and thoroughness of the environmental analyses. During anomaly investigations, check and recheck conclusions, analyses and tests. It is easy to go down the wrong path when results of tests yield answers that match pre-conceived ideas. Design the system for on-orbit test. In this case there was an ability to examine the performance of individual elements. In many systems, this is not the case. Assure adequate clearance of dielectric or conductive material from resonant structures such as the microstrip circuitry including radiating RF antenna elements and transmission lines.","Lesson ID":1180}

{"Recommendation(s)":"NASA concurs with the ASAP recommendation. As a result of the ASAP findings and recommendations, as well as other external and internal reviews of the workforce, NASA has terminated downsizing at the Office of Space Flight (OSF) Centers. All four OSF Centers-the Johnson Space Center (JSC), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and the Stennis Space Center (SSC)-are in the midst of large-scale efforts to replace skill losses and increase the number of entry-level professionals. NASA has a plan in place to hire close to 600 new employees in fiscal year (FY) 2000 that will fill some of our most critical skill shortages and enable us to begin efforts to rebuild our cadre of future leaders. These new critical staff hires are designed to support program requirements for Space Shuttle Operations and Upgrades, Space Station Development and Operations, Expendable Launch Vehicles, Advanced Space Transportation Technology and other Center mission-related and administrative requirements. The hiring of these new employees is geared to alleviating stress impacts resulting from expanding workload pressures coupled with continuous downsizing; eliminating critical skill shortages across our programs and Centers; and pursuing fresh-out hires to revitalize our Science and Engineering (S&E) knowledge base for future program and project management responsibilities. In addition, NASA is seeking to refocus our workforce composition towards a future-oriented research and development base. Specific short-term scientific and engineering expertise or operations-oriented requirements will be satisfied by utilizing nonpermanent term appointments and Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignments. In addition, we anticipate the ability to replace upcoming losses on a one-for-one basis in the years to come. Our hiring capability has sparked renewed enthusiasm throughout JSC, KSC, and MSFC, and SSC. Employees and managers are eager to return to a time when NASA had a continuing influx of the best and brightest graduates in the engineering and science fields. We have carefully planned our recruiting strategy to ensure success in achieving this goal. To this end, we have identified critical skill shortages and made them our top hiring priorities. We have established a goal of hiring 50 to 70 percent of new personnel at the entry level in an effort to revitalize our workforce with high-caliber, recent graduates. NASA's recruiting efforts are aimed at some of the top engineering and business schools in the country, including minority universities. We have involved many NASA employees in our recruiting initiative by sending them to conduct on-campus interviews with potential candidates. The OSF Centers' rigorous screening process requires that potential employees possess degrees that are consistent with long-term needs, a minimum grade point average of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale), outstanding references and other indicators of high achievement (e.g., extracurricular activities, honor society membership, community involvement, and awards). We are already seeing hiring results that are on track for meeting these goals. Finally, the contractor workforce will be enhanced, where appropriate, for maintaining safe and effective operations. An example of this is the United Space Alliance (USA) initiative to enhance work documentation with new technology and off-the-shelf products and still maintain increased flight-rate capability.","Lesson ID":1134}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Based on the findings and conclusions, the Committee identified the following recommendations which should prevent similar incidents in the future and improve overall range operations: Management for both the Range User and the Range should ensure that the roles and responsibilities of critical decision making personnel are clearly defined and understood. The Range User and the Range should establish, document, and fully coordinate all mission rules and launch constraints. A final pre-mission briefing should be conducted as near the intended launch date as possible (1 to 2 days before launch). All key participants should be represented at this briefing. This briefing should include but not be limited to: a. Roles and responsibilities of all key participants and the launch decision process b. Mission rules and launch constraints c. Operational procedures including standard abort\/hold terminology d. Communication channels assignments and protocol A direct link should be provided (either voice or electronic) from the WFF RSO\/TD to the flight crew that enables the WFF RSO\/TD to hold the launch in the latter stages of the count should an abort\/hold condition arise. The terminal countdown should be conducted on a single communications net. All critical mission status calls should be made on this net. The FTS CDR mission rule should be reviewed. All inflight non-reversible countdown items such as battery activation should be preceded by a \"go for\" command. Video from carrier and\/or chase aircraft is a highly desirable source of information and should be provided for all future missions. Prior to launch, various scenarios should be conducted that exercise abort calls from the various mission support elements. A dress rehearsal which exercises as many assets as possible should be conducted prior to each launch. There should be a recovery day between dress rehearsal and launch.","Lesson ID":1090}

{"Recommendation(s)":"FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Root Cause of Problem.- The T\/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the T\/V chamber was unstable in the TOPEX\/POSEIDON configuration. Contributing Causes Lack of Stability Analysis - A stability analysis of the total T\/V Fixture Assembly (T\/V Lift Fixture, Cables, SHSS, Satellite, supporting thermal shrouds, and instrumentation) was not performed, reviewed, or approved prior to the overturning incident. Recommendation: A Stability analysis must be performed on all lifting devices in all lift configurations and must be repeated with each new application assigned. A stability factor of 1.5 or greater should be analytically demonstrated to cover possible differences between analysis and the actual lifted assembly. The stability analysis should be treated as a formal mandatory item in the same manner that stress analysis is addressed. Inadequate Stability Testing - Stability testing was done during the proof loading tests of the lifting fixture, and again with the complete T\/V Fixture Assembly. Because the impact of clevis friction was not taken into account, neither of these tests revealed the underlying instability. The two \"rocking\" tests were not analyzed for their adequacy in determining fixture instability. Recommendation: Detailed review of all elements of planned testing must be done to assure the testing will accomplish the goals of the test. Stability analysis of lifted assemblies should be done whether or not stability testing is planned. This analysis is essential to determine the need for and the adequacy of any stability testing. Continued Postponement of GSE Review - A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T\/V Fixture Assembly was repeatedly Postponed, and not held prior to use of the Assembly for lifting the spacecraft into the T\/V chamber. (In preparation for thermal vacuum testing an Environmental Test Readiness Review was held November 20-21, 1991. There was one page that addressed the entire mechanical GSE in the review documentation. This page was simply a listing of the mechanical GSE and its status.) A supplemental handout available at the November 20, 1991, Environmental Test Readiness Review (ETRR) included an assembly drawing of the lift configuration, but the drawing reproduction did not clearly show the cable attach points. A viewgraph of the lift configuration drawing was not shown at the ETRR. However, it was shown at the previous Monthly Status Review (MSR). Recommendation: Formal mechanical GSE design reviews must be held to assure adequate design evaluation of the proposed lifting configurations. Discussions must include a detailed review of the proposed drawings and procedures for specific attach points, stability analyses, direction of motion, and expected accelerations for all moves. Lack of Designer Experience and Peer Reviews - The Principal Engineer was not familiar with stability analysis of lifting fixtures for loads lifted below the C.G. and did not follow the lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook. Furthermore, no peer review, internal contractor review, or project review of the total T\/V Fixture Assembly occurred. The review process failed. Recommendation: Accepted guidelines should be followed in the design of all lifting fixtures. This is especially true when the designer has not designed a lifting fixture before and is unfamiliar with the shortfalls of various lifting fixture configurations. In all cases, a review of the design and margins should be held with peers and supervision to assure the design meets all requirements. A checklist which includes all aspects of the design e.g., stability, loads analysis, proof loading, etc. should be developed. GSE Project reviews should be held and attended by personnel who are capable of assessing the adequacy of the design being reviewed. Lack of Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration (dry run) of the chamber lift activities was not performed prior to the incident. However, a lift of the T\/V Fixture Assembly (without the spacecraft) was done earlier for a form fit of the SHSS and thermal shrouds. There were significant, differences in C.G., fixture alignment, and personnel assignments between this lift and the actual spacecraft lift. Recommendation: A high fidelity dry run, using the lifting fixture with the proper mass and C.G. simulator and following the procedures that will be used for the actual lift should be conducted. A formal briefing before the dry run and debriefing after the dry run of the personnel involved should be made for all high value one of a kind spacecraft and equipment. On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur. Lack of Host Center Review of Hazardous Operations Procedures - The host center (GSFC) did not review the hazardous procedures\/operations planned by the outside user organizations. Also the GSFC did not require advance notification of the Center Code 205 or 302 safety organizations of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation. Recommendation: Host center personnel should be required to review all hazardous procedures\/operations planned by outside user organization. Host center personnel are much more familiar with the characteristics (and quirks, if any) of their equipment and facilities. Also, they are more likely than the visiting organization to be highly experienced in the type of operations involved. A requirement for formal Host Center \"Buy-Off\" (signature of concurrence) would help ensure proper visibility and attention to hazardous procedures\/operations. In addition, the development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered. Advance notification would allow the safety organization the option of monitoring or witnessing selected hazardous activities and ensuring that all internal and external safety requirements are being satisfied. Remaining Spacecraft Handling Operations: At this time the T\/V spacecraft handling equipment has been redesigned, tested, analyzed, reviewed and used to move the spacecraft back into the T\/V Chamber. Recommendation: The TOPEX Project must examine and approve the stability analysis for all remaining handling configurations, including those at the launch site. A GSE review should be conducted for all remaining handling operations as soon as possible.","Lesson ID":1089}

Recommendation: Train employees on the significance of documented procedures. Require the use of comprehensive and well-reviewed procedures and checklists. Finding: The work schedule pressure caused some individuals to be overworked. Recommendation: Review manpower, work schedules, and limit overtime. Ensure the project schedule is reasonable. CONTRIBUTING CAUSES: Finding: The K-bottles of gases are not color coded for different gases. Recommendation: Develop a method of uniquely identifying K-bottles by gas species and consider using unique fittings for different types of gas systems. Finding: The individual connecting the GN2 K-bottle to the flight hardware exhibited complacency when he failed to look at the label on the K-bottle prior to connection and when he tagged the K-bottle for pick up earlier in the move sequence. Recommendation: Provide training to all Integration and Test (I&T) personnel to verify gas type, inspect for cleanliness, check grade, and document the activity and results during any operation that involves the flight article. Finding: Department of Transportation (DOT) Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) regulations were not met. Recommendation: Provide training for appropriate individuals on DOT HAZMAT regulations and shipping documents. Finding: SU identification, traceability, and accountability of gas K-bottles are inadequate. Recommendation: Improve the identification of gases and the control and traceability by requiring appropriate identifying paperwork to accompany all fluid supplies and by providing a segregated and labeled storage area for different types of gases. More detailed recommendations may be found in the complete board report which is included with this lesson learned.","Lesson ID":1041}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Appropriate experience and tooling must be sought, and ample time allocated for practice before viable seal preforms can be machined. For example, machining of PTFE to close tolerances using a conventional lathe required spraying isopropyl alcohol (IPA) directly on the PTFE during preform fabrication and final trimming to create the final seal profile. Implementation of established machining guidelines for PFTE was also found to be essential [1]. Accurate machining of small RPOV piece-parts was further assisted by the use of a video microscope and monitor system with quotin-processquot measurement and inspection capability.

{"Recommendation(s)":"When designing with PTFE, the tendency of PTFE to undergo creep and cold flow must be considered. While a positive interference fit is necessary to avoid gap formation and seal recession in semitrapped seals, the interference fit should remain close to the elastic limit of PTFE so that key mechanical properties are not changed irreversibly. The use of smaller, properly proportioned preforms may benefit long-term seal performance by reducing the magnitude and gradient of internal stress, and thus minimizing the tendency of seals to extrude. Internal stress could be further minimized by a slower strain rate when tightening down on the retainer via the hot-forming fixture during seat assembly, or by post-assembly annealing.","Lesson ID":1038}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Review the written procedures and the laboratory Chemical Hygiene Plan for the task. Perform job hazard analyses for all laboratory tasks. Wear protective clothing (goggles, gloves, coat) and work in a clean well-ventilated fume hood. Keep the sash down when reactions are in progress. Never take aqua regia out of the hood. Only prepare the amount you need for immediate use and destroy any excess in the hood in which it was prepared. Aqua regia can be destroyed by cautious and careful dilution with water. Use a large waste container and add the aqua regia to the water, which will produce a less hazardous and less reactive waste. Never store aqua regia and never put it in a closed container, since evolved gases will cause a pressure build-up and possible explosion. Label waste container to remind employees of specific waste. Schedule a frequent waste pickup disposal. This will prevent overfilling of the container and will promptly remove the hazard from the work area. Assess the physical characteristics of any mixture through literature searches, professional consultation, or direct test\/check out of the mixture both prior to and subsequent to loading the reaction system especially for the first time. Be aware of the limitations of relying on material safety data sheets (MSDS) and other literature to assess the hazardous characteristics of a mixture. MSDS do not traditionally address interactions between a mixture's chemical components except as broad classes (acids versus bases, oxidizers versus reducing agents, or organics, etc.).","Lesson ID":945}

Managers\/supervisors must continuously reinforce the safety principle that \"whenever there is a conflict between our safety objectives and mission objectives, safety shall be our first consideration\". Management shall provide easy access to all safety documentation for employees. When new information is distributed, an overview of the information should be provided through some form of interactive presentation such as branch meetings, toolbox discussions, etc. Maintenance engineering should be incorporated in the requirements for facility design. All facilities that have the potential for fall hazard should be inspected for fall hazards within the next six months. Update AHB 1700.1 to correct errors in fall protection references. The Ames Safety Office should prepare an additional chapter dedicated to this subject matter. The Ames Safety Office should evaluate the existing training records database for effectiveness in informing supervisors of their employees training history and requirements. The Ames Safety Office should provide training or professional assistance to employees and their supervisors on hazard identification for their areas of control. Inspectors who conduct periodic safety inspections should have adequate expertise and training to be able to identify existing hazardous conditions in the workplace.","Lesson ID":940}

Limit the opportunity for contamination introduction by minimizing the use of potential contaminants and using permanent closures on joints were applicable. Keep joints closed at all times when access is not required to perform work. Implement an improved method of dealing with loose, non-serialized materials to ensure full accountability. Additional inspections and checkouts should be considered to verify that the engine is contamination free, prior to any hot-fire. The use of reusable joint barriers, which can be controlled and accounted for, should be investigated. Provide clear instructions in processing paperwork and discrepancy paperwork. Use positive identification of engine hardware to ensure that the work is being done on the correct part. Correct electronic paperwork systems, to either prevent changes or provide a clear tracking of change activities. Further ensure that all SSME changes can be tracked. SSME Project should investigate evidence to ensure that SSME 0523 Powerhead structural properties were adequate. Ensure that an unacceptable condition does not exist in the flight fleet. The SSME Project should understand the mechanism causing roller bearing failure and ensure that conditions experienced were outside the designed capability of the roller bearing.

Add quotmaintenance practicesquot (in general) and QRPs and tethers (specifically) to first line management's Site Safety Observation Checklists, to ensure QRPs are stowed correctly, as well as to ensure maintenance inspection and repair tasks are effectively completed. Charter a cross-functional team to assess the current status of the facility maintenance program and identify areas of improvement needed to enhance maintenance effectiveness. Develop an Internet Based training course that emphasizes the expectations for achieving a quotLevel of Excellencequot for maintenance practices. As a minimum, course content should address the proper use, stowage, inspection, maintenance and repair of QRPs and tethers. Corrective Action Engineering should review, and correct as needed, their in-house recurrence control identification process. Revise and standardize final inspection acceptance criteria sheets, to verify the as-built configuration matches the released engineering design. Eliminate\/minimize the handling risk associated with the current design of the F-9 kickplate. Modify the F-9 kickplate, as needed, in order to attach it permanently to the F-9 flip platform. Identify any other kickplates being used in the processing facilities that present a similar handling risk. Revise the pre-VAB rollout inspection.

{"Recommendation(s)":"It is imperative that documented procedures accurately reflect defined processes, especially when configurations change, work environments change, or new equipment is introduced. Procedures embarked upon without verification of their adequacy and correctness can lead to a false sense of security that all work is being done safely. Managers and employees at all levels must ensure that complacency is not allowed to creep into the work environment. Hardware must only be used for its intended function. As the need arises to expand that function, it must be accomplished through an appropriate evaluation and review process. Risks inherent in all phases of process execution must be assessed to ensure that appropriate safeguards and controls are clearly specified in training and procedures.","Lesson ID":918}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The fabrication or test organization should thoroughly inspect all MGSE for fastener engagement and specified torque prior to delivery for use by a project. Where feasible, threaded components that are to be placed under tension should be designed with a positive locking device. Otherwise, fastener heads should be spot bonded or torque-striped, as appropriate, to enhance visual inspection of thread engagement. Flight projects should also conduct thorough visual and physical inspections of MGSE prior to each individual use (Reference 3). These inspections should be documented in appropriate procedures, such as JPL Assembly and Inspection Data Sheets (AIDS) for lifting critical hardware. Personnel safety should be addressed, as appropriate, by all procedures. In addition, all test personnel should constantly remain at a safe distance during operations involving suspended loads.","Lesson ID":914}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Satellite builders and operators should plan for thermal capacitance testing as an additional method of fuel gauging. Since propellant tank system thermal response is defined by mass and heat capacity, the rate of temperature rise due to a known heat input is an indication of remaining fuel in the tank. Careful location of heaters and temperature sensors can allow prelaunch calibraton and on-orbit thermal tests that can provide propellant gauging where the uncertainty decreases with depletion.","Lesson ID":915}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Survey existing buildings and be responsible to see that all buildings have correctly posted and clearly visible building numbers. The Center's maps should be updated periodically and distributed to all emergency organizations. Replace the back-up fire alarm receivers with models that can correctly report the building number consistent with the main receiver. Alarms to the duty office, during periodic testing, should verify the building number. Assure adequate fire truck access when determining site for a facility. Do not locate modular buildings in places that do not have access directly to streets. The trailer\/modular building standard, which NASA is currently developing, should require more detailed inspections of such facilities with special emphasis given to the building mechanical and electrical systems. Construction inspectors should conduct periodic inspection of modular buildings under construction on site. Specify that all furnaces with electric re-heat or auxiliary heating coils be provided with access panels at the electric coils. This would allow for initial and periodic inspection of the coils for dust and debris accumulation. The new NASA trailer\/modular guide specification should include access panels at electric furnace heating coils.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Select an appropriate sized bearing set and redesign the housings as required. Based on an updated analysis decide on components that should be monitored during testing and add appropriate instrumentation such as thermocouples or resistance temperature detectors. The adequacy of all components must be carefully checked using appropriate loads; documentation must be completed. Modify procedures so that if emergency conditions are encountered when the rotor torque is negative the Emergency Stop is initiated. Realistic limits should be set up, and then if they are encountered a Wind Tunnel Emergency Stop should be activated. Give the monitor for the Bar Chart Monitor an Emergency Stop button. Develop a closed-loop control for E\/F and RPM that provides accurate control and relieves the operator of the workload associated with control of these variables. Consideration should be given to human engineering the control consoles. Special consideration should be given to emergencies. Assembly procedures should be well documented, and there should be mandatory in-process inspection points. It is not fair nor prudent to place full responsibility for accurate assembly on one person. Improve maintenance documentation; for example, records of bearing changeout should be maintained. When an incident occurs and actions are taken there should be sign-offs by the Branch and Division Chiefs approving actions taken or intended. Insist that each manager from section head on up through the NFAC organization be totally accountable to the process of configuration management. NFAC has the written process in place. Management must make sure it does what it's supposed to do; i.e., control all potential hazards. Critical components such as fasteners and bearings must be accurately described. Add blade angle (or collective actuator position) to the PCM tape, and incorporate means of ensuring the azimuth position on the tape is reliable before testing. Consider adding Wind Tunnel dynamic pressure to the tape as well. Use dual tape machines that overlap tapes so that tapes do not have to be changed during a run, or shorten the runs. Modify the Data Acquisition System (DAS) so the data on the PCM tape are not interrupted, or change the procedure to not record data on the DAS during emergencies. The outer race retaining nut should be modified (i.e., by extending it and adding a shoulder) to stop the inner race slider from moving very far in the event of a bearing failure. Consider locating a collective blade angle transducer closer to the blades as a safety monitor. Because the signal would have to go through the slip rings and would therefore be less reliable, it is recommended that this be a safety monitor only and not replacement for the present system. Reinforce the bottom rails of the first fence, and double the height of the second fence. A quick verification is to do a hardness test, and hardness testers are not very expensive. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to sensitize the Wind Tunnel operators and mechanics to fastener problems and for them to have their own hardness tester for quickly and conveniently checking all fasteners they have doubts about. When doing armor plate\/fragmentation calculation it is usual to assume the maximum impact velocity is at the maximum normal tip speed. Because of the over-speed encountered, this assumption should be reconsidered.","Lesson ID":869}

{"Recommendation(s)":"The Board strongly recommends that the two Agencies proceed immediately with a comprehensive review of SOHO operations addressing issues in the ground procedures, procedure implementation, management structure and process, and ground systems. This review process should be completed and process improvements initiated prior to the resumption of SOHO normal operations. The recommendations are described below in detail. GROUND PROCEDURES An ESA and NASA review of the process for SOHO operational procedure change should be implemented forthwith. The review should critically assess the process from beginning to end. The review should include matters such as who can initiate a change, who agrees it should be made, how is the modification process monitored, how is it validated, how is it introduced into operations, how it is signed-off, how are the users of the procedure informed of the change, and how are users trained on the new version. All SOHO procedures modified since launch should be identified and subjected to a thorough review of the changes made and their verification and validation status. The review should be led by ESA and supported by MMS, NASA, and the FOT. This review should be completed before the resumption of routine operations. If there is any doubt about a procedure, it should be re-validated. PROCEDURE IMPLEMENTATION NASA should perform an immediate comprehensive audit of all ISTP on-going flight operations activities to assess conformance to contractual requirements addressing areas such as leadership, configuration management, roles\/responsibilities, anomaly handling, and general procedure implementation and validation. The activities pertinent to SOHO should include ESA in the review. ESA and NASA should review the decision authority for real-time divergence from agreed upon ground or spacecraft procedures. In the event that a problem is encountered during any procedure execution, the decision authority for the subsequent action must be clearly defined. Spacecraft safety must never be compromised. It is critical that NASA should review the relevance of selected metrics to determine adequacy for contractor performance evaluation. MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE AND PROCESS ESA and NASA should review the allocation of their responsibilities for the operation of the SOHO mission, as defined in the STSP MOU, Program Plan, and SOHO Mission Management Plan. Assessment should be made as to how these responsibilities have been undertaken by both parties. Changes should be proposed and implemented where appropriate. In particular, ESA's responsibilities for the technical integrity and safety of the spacecraft and science instrumentation and NASA's responsibilities for Ground Segment infrastructure and the conduct of the mission in accordance with the approved Flight Operations Plan should receive critical focus. This review should be preceded by internal reviews in both Agencies and completed prior to return to normal operations. It is anticipated that the review should result in an improved Mission Management Plan. ESA and NASA should re-assess staffing to ensure it is commensurate with the complexity and criticality of the SOHO mission and consistent with the updated Mission Management Plan. The staffing should be strengthened as required. Surge capability should exist to support non-routine and contingency operations. NASA should perform a risk-based analysis of operations plans to determine the level of insight\/oversight appropriate for joint, cooperative, and PI missions with special attention to accountability. GROUND SYSTEMS All operational timelines should be planned and validated well before implementation with proper attention to risk assessment and contingency planning. The operations scripts (the string of procedures used by the FOT) for other than routine science operations should be put under configuration control and any change formally approved by ESA and NASA. Each time such a script is changed, the whole script should be validated. Flight operations should verify response to spacecraft configuration changes and critical commands to ensure proper execution. Flight operations should verify configuration prior to initiating critical spacecraft activity to ensure it is consistent with planned events. ESA\/ESOC should lead an independent assessment of the capabilities of the NASA SOHO simulator and provide recommendations for suggested maintenance and enhancements. The FOT should review the current database to ensure that all critical parameters are flagged as out-of-limits (and preserved) if they violate values as defined in the ESA provided satellite users manual. If possible, automatic monitoring should be extended to all telemetry. An ESA and NASA board should review all outstanding Ground System Problem Reports and the plans to close them.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Practice: Operational spacecraft can experience adverse effects from impinging high energy radiation. A single event upset (SEU) occurs when a single particle, usually a heavy ion or proton, deposits enough charge at a sensitive node in a microcircuit to cause that circuit to change state. In general, these effects are temporary and appear as \"soft failures\" such as anomalous bit flips or spurious commands. In extreme cases, latch-up can occur and result in the destructive failure of the part. The practice is to formulate an energetic particle environment model for calculating single event effect rates by utilizing the JPL statistical models for solar proton, alpha particle and heavy ion fluence. This predicted rate, which is a function of cumulative probability, is a useful measure when specifying shielding thickness to protect susceptible components, employing mitigating software, or both to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Note that this assessment does not consider concentration of particle radiation due to the Earth's magnetic field, (ref. 1), and factors which are not influenced by shielding thickness, such as GCR (Galactic Cosmic Rays).","Lesson ID":647}

{"Recommendation(s)":"When determining the magnetic properties of an end product by analysis, do not rely solely on the known magnetic properties of the constituent material(s). Consider factors that may have changed the original magnetic characteristics, including the fabrication method and the shape, length, and mass of the end item. Also, consider exposure to external fields that may magnetize materials during fabrication and handling. Steps to control residual magnetization of flight hardware may include: a) imposition of a limit on residual dipole moments (e.g., degauss to less than 5 A-m2), b) performance of magnetic testing on end items, c) implementation of controls to maintain a magnetically clean ambient ground environment, and d) monitoring of spacecraft field exposure with magnetic sensors attached to the spacecraft during handling and ground transportation.","Lesson ID":642}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Critical procedural steps should be identified during systems design and flagged as critical in vehicle operations procedures. Then, independent verification of all critical steps should be performed during execution of operations procedures. NASA should perform a handover design review when any program is transferred from another agency. The quotrapid prototypingquot philosophy was cited as the rationale for employing minimal written procedures. The concept should be revisited from an operations perspective. Prelaunch processing documentation and data tapes should be kept as historical records for each flight at least until a mission is completed and degree of mission success is understood. Up-to-date hazardous materials information should be supplied to the appropriate hazardous response agencies at the start of any flight program in the future.","Lesson ID":638}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Independent, separate pyro inhibits should be considered for mission critical events, particularly if all pyro functions can be simultaneously armed and enabled. Hence, activitation of a pyro event would require two separate actions - one separate action to enable the inhibit and another to fire the pyros. This approach would preclude spurious transient pyro firings during turn-on and preclude sympathetic firings induced by sneak path and\/or crosstalk\/magnetic field interactions that may occur in cabling. Testing only for correct functional behavior should be augmented with a significant effort in testing for anomalous behavior, especially during intitial turn-on and power-on reset conditions. Peer reviews should be required by Project Management and held as often as necessary. Peer reviews should consider the heritage capability and limitations of the support equipment to be used for testing the flight design. Project review board members should consistently penetrate the system and subsystem functional design and implementation to expose risk areas, particularly where multiple\/complex interfaces exist. Reviews should fully define spacecraft and payload interface requirements, and have a cognizant systems person from each program element review the other persons' test program and payload\/spacecraft simulators for fidelity. System and subsystem engineers should consistently evaluate functional designs and implementation to expose risk areas, particularly where multiple\/complex interfaces exist. Projects with multiple components, i.e. spacecraft bus and a separate instrument, require complete team coopoeration, openness, and the ability to penetrate and understand each other's design responsibilities in a timely manner.","Lesson ID":637}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Based on observations from the Lewis Program, the Board offers the following recommendations in order to enhance mission success in future programs performed under this new paradigm: Balance Realistic Expectations of Faster, Better, Cheaper. Meaningful trade space must be provided along with clearly articulated priorities. Price realism at the outset is essential and any mid-program change must be implemented with adequate adjustments in cost and schedule. This is especially important in a program that has been implemented with minimal reserves. Establish Well Understood Roles and Responsibilities. The Government and the contractor must be clear on the mutual roles and responsibilities of all parties, including the level of reviews and what is required of each side and each participant in the Integrated Product Development Team. Adopt Formal Risk Management Practices. Faster, Better, Cheaper methods are inherently more risk prone and must have their risks actively managed. Disciplined technical risk management must be integrated into the program during planning and must include formal methods for identifying, monitoring and mitigating risks throughout the program. Individually small, but unmitigated risks on Lewis produced an unpredicted major effect in the aggregate. Formalize and Implement Independent Technical Reviews The internal Lewis reviews did not include an adequate action response and closure system and may have received inadequate attention from the contractor\u00b9s functional organizations. The Government has the responsibility to ensure that competent and independent reviews are performed by the Government, the contractor, or both. Establish and Maintain Effective Communications A breakdown of communications and a lack of understanding contributed to wrong decisions being made on the Lewis program. For example the decision to operate the early on orbit mission with only a single shift ground control crew was not clearly communicated to senior TRW or NASA management. The Board believes that, especially in a \"Faster, Better, Cheaper\"program these working relationships are the key to successful program implementation. Although this report necessarily focused on what went wrong with the Lewis Program, much also went right due to the skill, hard work, and dedication of many people. In fact, these people completely designed, constructed, assembled, integrated and tested a very complex space system within the two-year goal and probably came very close to mission success.","Lesson ID":625}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Spacecraft hardware susceptibility to corona-induced damage should be addressed in subsystem design and in test and operational procedures. Ensure that ventable products will be vented overboard in spaceflight instead of venting within any enclosures, including blankets. The following design measures for corona avoidance on high voltage circuits, summarized from Reference (1), were recently used in the Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument program (Reference (2)): Avoid venting into regions of intense electric fields, such as the vicinity of power supplies and power wiring. Ensure that all critical voltage regions are properly vented. Use insulation materials of high dielectric strength. Insulating materials with strength greater than 300 volts\/mil and a relative dielectric constant less than 5 are preferred. For high voltages, use only connectors that have been tested to work in the critical pressure region. Also, use only soldering terminals rated for high voltage. Physically isolate the high and low voltage circuits. Test the circuits that may be subject to voltage breakdown and\/or corona discharge.

Another recommendation would be NOT TO USE THIS DESIGN. If it is desired to break all connections to the power source then this could be done with an arm and a prearm single pole elements in each leg of the design or with double pole elements. Best of all options would be to not use this kind of ground fire pulse design AND check the status of fusing element after each use of the circuit and prior to launch.

{"Recommendation(s)":"Following the use of any chlorinated product, a thorough and complete cleaning to remove all residual chlorine contamination is a necessity.","Lesson ID":434}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Coded interface circuits should employ isolated power supply and grounding schemes. System level requirements must be generated for the design of grounding of interfaces. Compatibility tests, using representative equipment (prototype or breadboard) should be conducted as early as possible for subsystems having new, or complex interfaces. Where noise immunity is critical, injection of noise on the signal lines may be necessary to demonstrate that adequate margin exists. These tests (and the design\/analysis that precedes them) should account for the fact that differences will exist between subsystem and system configurations. The noise characteristics in the lab may be different than the system configuration, for example.","Lesson ID":412}

{"Recommendation(s)":"On mission critical rotating mechanical equipment, life cycle testing should be performed under realistic conditions to obtain a reasonably accurate life-time forecast prior to final design acceptance and flight qualification. For design of rotating elements used in a space environment, care should be taken on those facets of the design which could contribute to increased drive torque requirements with continuing use. For precision mechanisms containing moving parts which are susceptible to binding in the presence of particulate matter or fluid contaminants, the use of bonding agents for locking devices should be tightly controlled. This particular application used nylon, Solithane and Stycast for the purposes of screw locking and wire harness bonding. Post assembly cleaning and inspection for contaminants are critical elements in the fabrication process. Properly applied, nylon, Stycast and Solithane are stable compounds. All of these materials however, are highly productive of particulate contamination when abraded or disturbed. Rework, such as breaking free a screw head which is bonded in place, or cutting a Stycast spot bond away, tends to produce large quantities of very small particles which must be subsequently located and removed. A set of spare spacecraft hardware should be maintained in the flight configuration and within specification to enable detailed analysis of suspected causes of in-flight faults and validation of proposed corrective actions or workarounds.","Lesson ID":394}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Procurement of parts with a prior history of problem\/failures should be specifically re-evaluated prior to re-use on a subsequent flight program.

Special screening tests and\/or additional special burn-in tests may also be warranted.","Lesson ID":433}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Diagnostic Radio Frequency system analysis and modeling are effective in identifying microwave design susceptabilities to RF leakage. They need to be scheduled early enough to allow the necessary design modifications to be accomplished. In addition, use of prototype models offers the opportunity to uncover problems without subjecting flight hardware to jeopardy.","Lesson ID":419}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Microwave RF circuit design that involves the practice of flight unit tuning by removal of conductive material, such as by use of abrasive or cutting tools, should be compatible with the substrate and circuit material, the packaging design, and other relevant factors. Post-tuning inspection is mandatory.","Lesson ID":427}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Use fresh stock when installing solder plated terminals. Evaluate date codes on packages of terminals to be used. Return residual stocks of solder plated brass terminals to controlled stores, or discard them on completion of the project. Perform solderability tests on any lot of solder plated terminals prior to use. Avoid installing solder plated terminals until immediately prior to populating the printed wiring board, if possible.","Lesson ID":402}
{"Recommendation(s)":"All interfaces with the spacecraft should be subject to failure mode analysis. Since it is difficult to anticipate all failure modes, use should be made of indicators or alarms to provide verification of operational performance or mode status. The spacecraft should not be left unattended unless periodic monitoring is conducted. The periods to be used and the parameters to be monitored should be based on an analysis of the conditions under which the spacecraft is left unattended.","Lesson ID":397}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Inflight test requirements should be considered in selection of telemetry data points. On Viking, the overall \"system\" problem was exacerbated because the Orbiter, the Lander, and the Viking Project were each the responsibility of different organizations. (The Galileo Orbiter and its Probe are a similar composite system, in which interactive RF effects need to be carefully assessed.) Early system decisions as to which tests will be necessary are needed to make correct recommendations regarding testability and test operating modes.","Lesson ID":411}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Although the Viking situation continued for more than two years, there are shorter periods when vehicles from different projects (for example, Voyager and Galileo) may be less than a few tenths of one degree from one another, as seen from a station. This potential interference must be properly accounted for in each project's frequency allocation process and mission design. On Viking there was no operational software available either within the Project or the Deep Space Network to use routinely to predict when such interference would occur. It was therefore necessary to preclude the possibility of interference (by forbidding ranging during critical spacecraft data return sequences) by operational rule. Also, it was necessary to accept occasional interferences and to acquaint the real-time operations people to the \"signature\" of these interferences.","Lesson ID":410}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The TWTA has numerous high-voltage areas needing protection from ground potential, by means of either insulated wire or potting compound. Note: The Martian atmosphere consists mainly of 95% carbon dioxide and about 3% argon. The ambient pressure at the Lander site is 7.2 millibars, corresponding to an Earth pressure of 5.2 torr. This constitutes a very critical pressure region in an atmosphere of \"active\" gasses. (Experimental experience with electrostatic discharge indicates that carbon dioxide produces corona at a voltage 19% lower than required for air, and argon at a voltage 60% lower than air.) Corona breakdown in Martian atmosphere could occur as low as 50 volts. The TWTA power converter has output voltages ranging up to 2 kV. The failure analysis concluded that somewhere in the TWTA system, a high-voltage point developed a gap between itself and circuit ground which then filled with Martian air. Lack of precise telemetry data from the Lander made it impossible to define the breakdown area any closer than the TWTA No. 1 as a whole. Power converter corona RF noise could have found its way into the ranging system via the radio system or power line pickup.","Lesson ID":404}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Tolerancing of screw length normally is examined to ensure adequate penetration. For captivated inserts, buildup of tolerances in the other direction becomes important. Captivated inserts should be designed so that conductive pieces of the insert are retained and will not fall into the electronics. Assembly of spacecraft bays should be closely monitored by the Quality Assurance organizations to verify that only screws of the proper length are used. The application method for conformal coating relied on to prevent electrical shorts must not leave uncoated conductors. Procedures governing required or planned ground activities and their interaction with stored on-board quotautomaticsquot must be carefully established and used.","Lesson ID":436}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Voyager uses a carrier suppression of 0.54 dB for the 64-meter stations compared to 3.0 dB for the 26-meter stations. The requirement for two different modulation levels does complicate mission operations. In noncoherent modes, the downlink frequency reference is derived from an on-board oscillator. Phase jitter in the loop VCO is acceptable under these conditions. Future projects, including Galileo, need to develop careful mission design to accommodate conditions such as command feedthrough where hardware modification is not considered feasible. Voyager command feedthrough parameters were established for the subcarrier frequency and bit rate used. Galileo will require similar tests for its bit rate of 32 bps, even though transponder design and command subcarrier frequency remain unchanged. 1995 Update: Missions presently in design at JPL use a 16 kHz command subcarrier to accommodate command feedthrough effects.","Lesson ID":418}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The space environment is a vital consideration in circuit design. Voids will slowly bleed down to critical pressure, thus allowing corona inception, which occurs at lower AC voltages than DC voltages. The possibility of critical pressure must be eliminated from all circuit parts having DC or AC potentials capable of causing corona or arcing. Many design weaknesses can be discovered through testing; however, testing should not be relied on to catch all. Independent analytical review of the circuit design and parts application benefitted the Voyager TWTA voltage doubler design.","Lesson ID":417}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Testing to verify the absence of such products should be performed during the pre- and post-environmental tests at the antenna subsystem level, and also after installation of the antenna on the spacecraft in tests at the Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) and as part of prelaunch preparations. The Hardware Design Engineer must be continuously cognizant of the intermodulation product phenomenon and implement design practices for its avoidance. Install the stainless steel mating shells on the semi-rigid aluminum cables with a torque from at least 45 in-lbs.","Lesson ID":416}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Short-term tests of the circuits may not be sufficient to rule out zenering. The rate of degradation is dependent upon the magnitude of zenering, and therefore changes in RF output can occur very slowly. Such changes may not be noticeable unless the circuit is operated continuously at a constant temperature for several days. Testing is complicated also by the condition of \"healing.\" If the circuit is turned off, some of the performance degradation tends to be recovered when the circuit is turned back on. The extent of the recovery is dependent upon the off period. Healing also takes place more rapidly at elevated temperatures.","Lesson ID":414}
{"Recommendation(s)":"This failure could have been avoided by providing an isolation resistor between each power supply terminal and the scanner. The voltmeter used to make the measurement has an input impedance of several megohms, so an isolation resistor of up to 100K ohms would have provided ample protection without affecting significantly the measurement accuracy. The difference between flight configuration and GSE configuration must be kept in mind. The normal inputs, connected to the spacecraft power converter, are isolated by at least 10K ohms. There is a need to be continuously conscious of the differences between flight and test configuration. The catastrophic potential of a reed relay failing to open was overlooked in this case. Support equipment failures must be prevented from propagating to the flight hardware.","Lesson ID":435}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Had the ability of the safing sequence to enable the thrusters been constrained in some manner until after launch, for example, the VO'75 problem would not have occurred.","Lesson ID":403}
{"Recommendation(s)":"RF breakdown should be one component of the worst-case analysis normally required in the design, and it should be accomplished early in the development phase of the program. The breakdown margin must include all operating environments. Voltages, power levels, spacings should all be checked to determine the susceptibility to both multipaction and ionization (corona) discharge breakdown. The margin must be determined (tested) for each environment expected. As a minimum, a margin of 3 dB (factor of two in power; factor of 1.4 in voltage), which has been verified by testing, is required. The breakdown margin of a passive component can usually be measured by applying up to 6 dB more input power than is expected during normal operation. However, measuring the breakdown margin of an active circuit, such as a transistor amplifier, is much more difficult and requires a well thought-out testing program.","Lesson ID":415}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The spacecraft design should consider the ease of commandability of those subsystems most likely to require real-time commanding. Ground Software must be designed to readily accommodate the generation of the necessary real-time commands and to minimize the time and effort required to update the software initial conditions resulting from real-time command activity. MOS procedures must accommodate real-time commanding in a way which meets established timeliness criteria and is compatible with acceptable levels of risk. The resulting capabilities and limitations must be widely communicated to all Project interests.","Lesson ID":425}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The use of explicit commands is recommended whenever no significant operational advantage exists using incremental commands. Should an incremental command capability be desired for other reasons, the system design should consider also implementing the explicit command capability to ensure fault tolerance.","Lesson ID":405}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Careful coordinated pre-flight analysis by both the Navigation and Spacecraft areas is needed to estimate the size and uncertainties of these effects, to establish the necessary operational interfaces, and to estimate the scope of the operations task. Spacecraft designs must be reviewed with an eye to avoiding impingement problems. If impingement is suspected, a test similar to the Voyager impingement test should be planned and executed early in the flight.","Lesson ID":424}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Consider the use of a redundant air data source (one of diverse design so as to lessen the probability of common cause failure) to increase the reliability of air data.","Lesson ID":360}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Consider the use of Pitot-static heating, even in the case of experimental aircraft used exclusively in normally dry, temperate environments.","Lesson ID":359}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Consider use of a larger diameter main parachute, especially where ejection is likely to be over land.","Lesson ID":361}
{"Recommendation(s)":"After the antenna pattern variations were noted during the mockup test, the Communications Ground Systems section developed a mathematical model which simulated the observed data closely. This model was used prior to launch, in conjunction with Deep Space Network station (CTA 21) to model the anticipated system degradation. It was also used to devise tracking methods to minimize the disturbing effects of the interferometer and spin modulation.","Lesson ID":407}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Fuses are normally coated in place. The unit in which they are installed must be removed from the spacecraft to replace the fuse. Removing a fused device is preferable to removing elements of the power subsystem because it causes less disturbance to the test. Moving the fuse to the device does leave the cabling unprotected by the fuse but the reliability of the cabling is so high that this lack of protection is usually well justified. Mariner'69 and Mariner'71 had fuses in various locations. Some were concentrated in the power subsystem; others were within the individual devices. Since that time, fuses have usually been located within each individual device being fuse.","Lesson ID":408}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The magnitude of the resulting non-gravitational accelerations should be estimated and compared with the navigation requirements on non-gravitational accelerations. If these requirements are exceeded, re-design of the navigation strategy and\/or the spacecraft may be required.","Lesson ID":423}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Avoid placing identical connectors in adjacent locations where mating connectors can easily be transposed during installation. When the conditions noted in recommendation #1 above are unavoidable, add a requirement that all connectors to be mated are clearly identified by color codes or other means which will make it obvious if transposition is about to occur during the mating process. If feasible, configure the cables in such a manner that the cable connectors cannot readily be mated with the wrong connector. Ensure that assembly technicians are trained, and sensitized to the dangers inherent in the transposition of connectors. Mandate that any mate of identical paired connectors be verified by a second party (preferably Quality Assurance) before any application of power. Series connect unique pairs of jumpered pins in identical connectors, and terminate the series connection in an external connector. Verify installation by continuity test.","Lesson ID":431}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Fully consider the cost\/risk tradeoff of not qualifying critical inherited designs for new operational uses. Potential loss of function of a redundant element may be preferable to obtaining no telemetry during high risk events.","Lesson ID":432}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Provide at least an hour's protection period following these events before returning the spacecraft to normal roll control. Bright objects resulting from a pyro event may also adversely effect other devices such as science instruments. A one-hour delay in operating these devices should be considered.","Lesson ID":422}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Priority should be given to maintain and update an anomaly recovery plan with an explicitly defined anomaly recovery team, with backups, and roles for each team member. Establish a configuration management system to log spacecraft event updates including documentation for software updates, commands, pre-fault and post-fault spacecraft states and anomaly resolution. Be prepared to immediately delay, delete or redo less-critical activities to enable highly reliable recovery work. Care must be taken when reusing previously successful command packages. Ensure that nonstandard ground system configurations are clearly identified in operational instructions.","Lesson ID":391}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Packaging designs, whether new or inherited, need to be reviewed for adequacy; especially when electrical power and thermal aspects of a design can be affected by spacecraft system configuration changes. Manufacturing processes need to encompass ease of manufacturing and inspection aspects. Inspection must be performed by Quality Assurance instead of by an assembler. Adequate temperature margins between qualification temperatures and expected in-flight operating temperatures need to be assured. Consider mission thermal cycle profile in mission design and test.","Lesson ID":387}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Consider using a fault tree matrix during the design phase to identify critical telemetry parameters needed to analyze failures. Match component screening and qualification to the mission, including any expected significant thermal cyclic excursions. Minimize mission designed power cycling to reduce thermally induced stress. Use of dry gas with moisture content below 5000 PPM in repackaging electronic components is a must.","Lesson ID":362}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Perform inheritance reviews to span the differences between the previous use of existing spacecraft designs, hardware and software, and planned new usage. Inheritance reviews should include the following assessments: Verification that the inherited hardware\/software designs are compatible with the spacecraft design, mission environment, qualification requirements and product assurance requirements. Verification of the necessity and mission compatibility of design changes and implementation plans. Determination of whether additional protoflight testing will be required for the inherited hardware\/software. Identification of potential risks associated with documented problems of inherited hardware and software. Delta inheritance reviews should be performed when major mission changes occur.","Lesson ID":346}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Avoid the use of combustible porous materials, such as wood, as tools for working on or in conjunction with solid propellants.","Lesson ID":344}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Design fault protection to detect and respond to excessive attitude control errors. Use RCS Thrusters to control excessive attitude control errors. Always test fault protection software on the flight spacecraft before launch.","Lesson ID":345}
{"Recommendation(s)":"It is imperative that spacecraft designers consider the consequences of anomalies at all mission phases and ensure that fault protection takes proper action regardless of spacecraft state. Fault responses should not be allowed to interrupt critical activities unless they have the ability to assure completion of these activities. Final, stable fault protection modes (such as contingency mode) should autonomously assure communications.","Lesson ID":343}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Consider designing self supporting racks in 1-G environment. (note that there are other factors to be considered such as weight and volume).","Lesson ID":325}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When performing operations (handling, machining, transporting, disposing) on solid propellant which has been exposed to conditions for which it was not designed, assess the condition for hazard potential, especially in regard to ignition sensitivity, and modify existing normal operation procedures to account for the possible changes in propellant characteristics.","Lesson ID":327}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The quality assurance oversight function should be a separate function from program and engineering management.","Lesson ID":332}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Use connector savers or intermediate connectors\/extension cables whenever frequent mating\/demating of connectors is required.","Lesson ID":316}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Perform an end to end systems engineering evaluation utilizing end to end functional testing or simulated testing to verify that the functional design is compatible with the requirements at all interfaces and to assure proper system performance and prevent loss or misapplication of safety critical functions.","Lesson ID":342}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Consider installing pressure systems above ground; if not feasible, then assure the integrity of the pressure system coating at the time of installation and locate system such that it is not in proximity to sources of stray electrical current. Perform periodic proof pressure tests on pressure systems.","Lesson ID":315}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Assignment of an experiment to a mission which is about to enter the payload analytical integration phase should be avoided if the experiment has not reached as a minimum, the following milestones: 1) Experiment has completed the preliminary requirements review, including general requirements for integration, and is approaching the preliminary design review. 2) Funding for the completion of experiment development and manufacture has been committed. 3) The experiment schedule for preliminary design review, critical design review, and software review realistically supports the integrated payload reviews. That is, the experiment reviews should lead the ipl reviews by at least six months.","Lesson ID":318}

{"Recommendation(s)":"Provide the capability to rapidly receive diagnostic data when in-flight anomalies occur, especially in regard to automatic shutdown or automatic entry into the safemode state. This may require the provision of backup communications, which can be transmitted on more than one telemetry configuration. Implement systems engineering which will require test and c\/o verifications and FMEA's to reveal interdiscplinarly activities.","Lesson ID":333}

{"Recommendation(s)":"End-to-end tests must be performed. Ensure that end-to-end tests to determine failure modes are performed prior to the disassembly of the payload. If functional redundancies for single point failure modes cannot be supplied, work arounds should be established before the start of the mission.

{"Recommendation(s)":"The mishap investigation board recommendations included: high pressure oxygen components should be designed to minimize flow configurations which may trap debris or create stagnation points, and minimize the generation of internal contamination. The mishap investigation board recommendations also included: evaluation of existing high pressure oxygen systems and replacement of existing metallic and non-metallic materials (silicone for silastic 675 in o-rings and monel for aluminum in regulators).","Lesson ID":8}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Training and certification of the solder technicians was upgraded to aerospace quality specifications DOD-STD-2000.","Lesson ID":2}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The investigation board recommended correcting deficiencies in the work procedures, emergency plans, and mission control allowable work policies; and training of personnel for these changes.","Lesson ID":3}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Ensure that any process modifications are considered for implementation in all units that were previously distributed or deployed - not just to those units processed after the process was modified.","Lesson ID":1}
{"Recommendation(s)":"End-to-end system tests to simulate actual use must be performed as early as possible in the test sequence. Early module level functional tests should be performed to detect RF timing\/leakage issues.","Lesson ID":304}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Tests should be run to verify that procedures for the handling and storage of capacitors to be used in electronic assemblies result in the absence of capacitor residual charges. Assembly procedures should require the shorting of capacitor leads just prior to installation. Capacitor leads should be shorted from manufacturing through storage.","Lesson ID":297}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Assure that contamination on internal rocket motor case walls is acceptably low by (1) performing bonding tests on \"witness\" samples which have been subjected to the same processes as the flight hardware, and, (2) inspecting the case walls by techniques such as ultraviolet light to determine if the cleanliness level is equal to or better than the witness samples.","Lesson ID":329}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Avoid the use of b-nuts in fluid systems","Lesson ID":323}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Electronic parts should be utilized only as per manufacturer's recommendations. Cognizant design engineers must consider fully the difference between the current and prior assumptions, electrical performance required, and potential risks when adopting an inherited design. Extreme care should be taken when applying any inherited designs since they do not ensure reliability. Similar care should be exercised when implementing inherited test plans.","Lesson ID":296}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The use of helicoils should be avoided. The use of locking devices should require the generation and use of detailed assembly procedures, clearly identifying potential problem areas and torquing limits for both temporary and final installations.","Lesson ID":306}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Thermally isolated subsystems with complex geometries such as the REM should be subjected to a series of solar thermal vacuum orientations at the subsystem level. Given the lack of a REM subsystem solar thermal vacuum test, the spacecraft system thermal vacuum test fixturing should allow much greater flexibility in orientation simulation. Design changes should be verified by test. Had a flight spare (or developmental) REM existed, such a retest would have easily shown that the problem was not solved. Thermal integration of the REM should be the responsibility of the prime contractor, not the REM supplier.","Lesson ID":349}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Vacuum outgassing procedures should be evaluated for consistency and effectiveness. System operation at temperatures beyond those expected in flight should be demonstrated during ground system thermal vacuum tests. For missions toward the sun from earth, the spacecraft system thermal control design should minimize or avoid solar exposure on critical thermal control surfaces.","Lesson ID":283}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Critical rocket engine component subsystem test procedures and actual performance should be carefully monitored by appropriate technical and quality assurance personnel. Test data from all qualification and flight acceptance testing of critical rocket engine component subsystems should be obtained, reviewed, and archived by JPL. The stability of new rocket engine designs should be intensively studied early in the development and\/or qualification cycle. Rocket engines should be tested with propellants which have been verified to be saturated with pressurant gas.","Lesson ID":351}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Employees should be familiarized with clear, safe handling practices and instructions written and agreed upon by both the NASA center and the contractor. These standards should be posted in work areas and enforced by quality assurance. Perform a careful examination and review of potential risks prior to utilization of existing fixtures for additional handling operations. Quality assurance personnel should review and approve all fixturing and setups for flight hardware prior to use. Inexperienced personnel should be supported by experienced personnel for a time sufficient to assure that they have been adequately trained in handling of flight hardware and are thoroughly familiar with the hardware and associated procedures. Use special awareness in the development of handling procedures and techniques in the event that someone other than the originator may be required to perform those functions.","Lesson ID":273}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Analysis of the design, load application and stability of a lifting fixture assembly, and the center of gravity of the load to be lifted, must be rigorously performed to verify and demonstrate that the final configuration is stable. Ensure qualified, experienced personnel are on site during critical hazardous operations.","Lesson ID":267}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Solder fatigue life should be treated as a mission consumable for the packaging design. Estimate the total mission thermal cycling expected in ground and flight operations, and compare with the demonstrated fatigue life capability of the hardware. The space between the printed circuit board and the electronic components must not be filled with conformal coat material unless thermal heat sinking is needed, and then the material must not exceed the thickness specified in approved documentation. Packaging design reviews should assure that approved design processes and procedures have been met. Electronic packaging design and fabrication must follow proven and qualified processes and procedures, and documentation must be regularly updated and maintained to meet current design needs.","Lesson ID":275}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Component part types, requiring mechanical lead forming, should have approved procedures and qualified processes with adequate sample testing prior to forming component leads for installation into flight hardware.","Lesson ID":268}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Generate preplanned in-flight workaround procedures for random performance anomalies to enable successful repeated flights of low-cost experiments. Base risk assessments for reflyable experiments on considerations involving data quality versus cost tradeoffs. In the case of low cost reflyable instruments, view the rules controlling testing and qualification established for single flight projects as guidelines only. Less than perfect performance can be accepted during any given mission.","Lesson ID":272}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Selection of spacecraft sensors should include a consideration of all environmental effects, including all sources of radiation. The selection of spacecraft materials that will be exposed to solar and other environments should include consideration of their tendency to shed particles that would be detrimental to the sensors of the spacecraft's subsystems or instruments. When the above selections cannot be fully attained, then system design must take into account the limitations and show that the risk is acceptable.","Lesson ID":269}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Because of the difficulties involved in ground testing spacecraft attitude and articulation control systems in a one G field, it is extremely important to conduct thorough reviews to verify math models of hardware and to understand the implications of simplification of math models on performance in flight. These reviews should involve hardware, analysis, software and systems engineers. Finer resolution display scales should be used around worst-case conditions to identify subtle instabilities.","Lesson ID":358}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Alarm and \"fail safe\" circuits must always be utilized with sensors located appropriately on the hardware and test facility to prevent the hardware from exceeding environmental limits. During the pretest functional verification of the test facility controls and alarm systems, attention should be given to the adequacy of transient data sampling and recording to assure timely recognition of \"out of tolerance\" test conditions. Require communication between test facility engineering personnel and cognizant hardware engineering personnel for approval prior to any override of \"fail safe\" devices. Program offices should give consideration, during the planning and initial stages of a project, to provide continuous quality assurance monitoring of all environmental tests as an additional safeguard against overlimit test conditions.","Lesson ID":274}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The alert process should be re-examined and consideration given to reissue of certain alerts on a periodic basis. Assembly involving flight components, even in non-flight equipment such as engineering models, should be controlled by the appropriate practices and procedures required for flight hardware, including grounding of soldering tips and wire strippers.","Lesson ID":285}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Care should be taken in deciding where to mount telemetry transducers to assure that the desired function is actually being measured, and not just a related function. All applications of microswitches should take into account the need for overtravel in the actuation stroke. Perform a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) early in the spacecraft life cycle, and involve the cognizant design personnel.","Lesson ID":289}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When simulating and testing command sequences, care must be taken to guarantee that the software and hardware states used during the test exactly match the software and hardware states that are expected in flight. Whenever a spacecraft anomaly changes any of the fundamental spacecraft states, all subsequent activities must be scrutinized for potential impacts.","Lesson ID":288}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A complete and thorough design review should be held for \"inherited\" designs of flight hardware. This review should examine changes in planned application, changes in design and plans for reanalysis and retest. Assure use of a dynamic test model for developmental testing of hardware designs based on \"inheritance\". Perform an in-depth analysis of interrelationships between modified and unmodified elements of flight hardware designs.","Lesson ID":271}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Spacecraft design should emphasize simplicity in interface design. Attempts should be made to allow for the design, development, assembly and test of subsystems as independent units. In planning welding operations, a simulation of the physical configuration of the components in the area of the welding operation should be included, in addition to the existing tests for weld integrity. Contact start welders should be considered where welding operations present the possibility of arcing problems such as were encountered during the assembly and welding of the Galileo Propulsion subsystem fuel line. The electrical and insulation characteristics of mechanisms such as the ball bearings in the Spin Bearing Assembly, which are not designed to conduct electricity, should be evaluated during the design process and consideration be given to electrical isolation of such mechanisms.","Lesson ID":399}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Test or retest of flight hardware should always be performed with adequate personnel in attendance, with QA surveillance and with approved test procedures. Clarification of this requirement in the flight project practices document should be considered. Prior to the use of test instrumentation, reviews should be conducted to verify that proper configuration and adequate precautions have been taken to prevent damage to flight hardware.","Lesson ID":287}
{"Recommendation(s)":"All primary and backup spacecraft flight configurations should be tested or analyzed before launch, including the most probable failure-mode configurations. Subsystem constraints that impose system constraints should be evaluated at system design reviews for their system impacts and their possible elimination. The flight rules generation cycle should be initiated early in the mission operations design, and emphasis should be placed on their review, including additions or revisions thereto, by all essential personnel (such as design cognizant engineers). Reviews of critical spacecraft operations should be initiated early in the design cycle and should include design specialists. For long duration missions, re-review before initiation of critical operations is highly desirable.","Lesson ID":286}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A task should be undertaken to understand the limits to which spacecraft and instrument contamination can be reduced for various levels of funding, and to develop design criteria and decontamination procedures to achieve these limits. Each project, for each contamination-susceptible instrument, should specify instrument-sensitivity objectives achievable with project resources. Each project with contamination-susceptible instruments should specify design criteria and should use decontamination procedures consistent with instrument-sensitivity objectives and project resources. A task is presently being funded by the WF\/PC project to characterize the contamination sources for WF\/PC-II. Carry this task through to completion and make the data available for future projects.","Lesson ID":352}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Investigate the suitability of using flex lines not susceptible to this type of failure (i.e. stainless steel bellows). Re-examine the loading procedures to minimize the failure mode, and verify by testing that electrostatic buildup can be controlled or contained. Consider using new flex lines when hazardous loading operations are performed. Investigate the physics of this failure type and determine maximum flow rates that will prevent, by a conservative margin, electrostatic discharges for each combination of non-conducting fluid through non-conducting tubes used in spaceflight operations.","Lesson ID":217}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When crimped contacts are to be used in spacecraft or ground support equipment cable harness assemblies, a requirement should be imposed on the fabricators, that color coded contacts and pull tests be incorporated into acceptance test procedures.","Lesson ID":302}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When planning RF tests in different facilities, pathfinder tests should be conducted to minimize loss in measurement precision or to eliminate the need for extensive workarounds. In conducting RF tests it is important to use RF probes with high directivity and to shield the antenna from metallic surroundings which cause RF reflections.","Lesson ID":381}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Care must be taken to ensure that design changes are properly reviewed.","Lesson ID":379}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Cognizant personnel, thoroughly familiar with the hardware, must be involved during the conduct of any critical or hazardous operation. Prior to performing any critical or hazardous operation on a spacecraft, procedures must be reviewed for clarity and correctness, and approved by cognizant technical personnel. If an assembly operation is untestable for verification, an independent check should be incorporated in the procedure (picture, X-ray, etc.). Unused mechanical or electrical connections should be sealed or otherwise protected to avoid misconnection by assembly technicians. Personnel involved in critical or hazardous operations on a spacecraft must practice the procedures and be qualified by hands-on experience.","Lesson ID":382}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Batteries should be mated to flight spacecraft only in a fully discharged state. Cables should be dressed and tied such that connections to wrong connectors are physically impossible. Connector designs should be selected such that pins can only make contact after full engagement of all alignment keys. This is particularly important when power connections are involved. Spacecraft design should avoid, whenever possible, connector locations that require blind mating of connectors. Design umbilical and direct access circuitry with protection to withstand direct shorts at the external connector interface without damage to the spacecraft. Use of Kapton insulation should be critically examined, particularly in spacecraft power circuit applications.","Lesson ID":386}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Handling spacecraft flight hardware is potentially hazardous and should be entrusted only to trained and skilled technicians, whether JPL or contractor, who are familiar with the laboratory's established practices and their rationale. The Del Mar Avionics company has modified the Hydra-Set design to reduce the probability of up pump handle breakage. Only appropriately modified hydraulic Hydra-Sets should be used. When sensitive or optical surfaces must be exposed to potential Hydra-Set leakage, consideration should be given to protective measures. Prior to initiation of any assembly or major equipment handling operations; Safety, Quality Assurance and handling procedures should be reviewed to assure that the appropriate cautions and restrictions on the use of Hydra-Sets are included.","Lesson ID":385}
{"Recommendation(s)":"All external areas of spacecraft flight hardware should be designed with consideration for assembly and handling operations. In particular, sharp or pointed corners, which could easily snag protective clothing should be avoided. This should be a topic for preliminary and critical design reviews at subsystem, instrument and system levels. Physical surveys should be conducted early in the assembly operations to identify hardware that is susceptible to handling damage. Protective guards and other procedural safeguards should be developed early before damage occurs. In situations where these safeguards are not possible or adequate, a second technician (buddy system) should be assigned to monitor and assist in the operation to provide another level of protection.","Lesson ID":355}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Fabric type Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) wrist straps containing conductive metallic fibers should not be used in the assembly, fabrication, or handling of electronic hardware. Nonshedding ESD wrist straps are available. Special care is required from all personnel who work in close proximity to critical hardware to avoid contamination of any type. All aspects of fabrication and test of critical hardware should be carefully reviewed before initiation of an activity.","Lesson ID":301}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The cognizant engineer must pay particularly careful attention to interfaces between powered and unpowered portions of his subsystem or between his subsystem and other subsystems to allow early detection and correction of potential sneak paths. These interfaces should be singled out for special attention during the design and development of all subsystems. Interfaces between powered and unpowered portions of subsystem circuitry should be specifically addressed at Critical Design Reviews (CDR) and in the Engineering Change Request (ECR) approval process.","Lesson ID":392}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The uncritical acceptance of equipment that has been classified as \"standard\" or \"flight proven\" should be avoided, especially if modifications of any level have been made on this equipment. Plans should be made early in the project to fully evaluate the heritage of previously used equipment. The degree of evaluation may have to be contractually defined on fixed-price contracts. When conducting a FMECA on the power system and other electrical components, electrical shorts should be considered as one of the potential failure modes.","Lesson ID":371}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Due to the complexity of spacecraft\/thruster configurations, additional care must be taken in the development and utilization of spacecraft and plume models. Analysis should be conducted on early and final designs, as part of the normal design team activity.","Lesson ID":377}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The cognizant engineer must fully consider the electrical performance of the cable in his specific subsystem application. The subsystem impact of simulator limitations should be thoroughly understood and documented. Additionally, testing with integrated breadboards instead of simulators should be encouraged. Subsystem equipment must be adequately tested on the spacecraft in all redundant configurations to ensure that equipment configuration dependent problems are found. Noise on intra-subsystem cabling must be thoroughly investigated as to cause and effects as early as possible in subsystem testing.","Lesson ID":383}
{"Recommendation(s)":"AC ground paths should be testable and should be verified in system interface verification tests. Interface circuits should be analyzed to identify any AC coupling paths between independent ground trees.","Lesson ID":281}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Required contamination control precautions include: Design for avoidance and control of contaminants. Measure contaminants in test environments and facilities. Identify and control contamination sources. Provide for protection during the transportation and launch environments. Design to minimize contaminant migration. Plan to clean contaminants off. Design for in-mission contaminant removal (heaters, wipers and covers).","Lesson ID":366}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The use of stainless steel components in combination with nitrogen tetroxide should be eliminated where obstruction in small passages may occur. Projects of long mission duration that use nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer systems and cannot avoid the use of stainless steel should develop a mechanism to predict flow decay hazard conditions. Oxidizers should be purified immediately before loading to minimize contamination products.","Lesson ID":305}
{"Recommendation(s)":"All metal shielding boxes and metal masses on circuit boards should be grounded even though they are inside equipment housings. All materials that could be exposed to ionizing radiation should be analyzed\/ tested to insure that unacceptable degradation will not occur. A set of spare hardware should be maintained to enable analysis of in-flight failures and validation of proposed corrective actions.","Lesson ID":384}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Subsystem facilities must be critically examined for the probability of any failure modes which may subject flight hardware to out-of-specification environments. Specification limits should be alarmed separately from control system limits. Operator response to alarms should be covered by straightforward safing procedures. The proposed use of nonstandard facilities for flight hardware should be very carefully weighed during the planning phase of a project or task and the following should be considered: Safety certification isn't a foolproof process. Availability of qualified operators is a greater problem for small subsystem teams than for the officially prescribed environmental test lab, particularly if long-term tests are planned. Upgrading facilities to meet requirements that are imposed because of the testing of flight hardware is likely to be expensive in schedule and dollars. Damage and subsequent repair to flight instruments or subsystems is costly in both schedule and dollars and could have severe project and mission impact.","Lesson ID":353}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Subsystem design analysis must not only include the circuit design, but all aspects of the end-to-end implementation, including such things as current carrying capacity of printed wiring board conductors. Testing at the subsystem level must include realistic duplication of the flight system configuration that could affect subsystem performance, including consideration for worst case system conditions.","Lesson ID":398}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The consequences and risk of damage to flight or developmental hardware imposed by test levels and test environment must be evaluated by the project office and the supporting technical division(s) with a formality commensurate with the consequences. To clearly understand the results of environmental tests, especially those that include exploratory or characterization aspects, detailed physical and functional inspection should be performed between \"separate tests\" to isolate any problems attributable to each particular test. The responsibility for the care and handling of any flight hardware should be unambiguously assigned throughout its preflight operational lifetime. Transfer of this responsibility should be unambiguous and formal. Kinematically indeterminate structures, not capable of detailed analysis, should be tested with prototype hardware rather than flight hardware.","Lesson ID":368}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When funding constraints require that trade-offs be made and the use of R&D equipment is contemplated, one must evaluate the operability and maintainability for continued reliable operations support.","Lesson ID":276}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Use of existing procedures, particularly in the materials and fabrication areas, should be carefully reviewed and followed. Extensions or modifications to standard procedures beyond their planned use should be carefully evaluated before use in a new application. Utilization of laboratory areas of expertise and standard documentation should be maximized by all designers of subsystems and modules. This is especially beneficial in the areas of packaging, materials and processes. New technology applications should be carefully reviewed.","Lesson ID":388}
{"Recommendation(s)":"During the spacecraft design phase, consideration should be given to: Increasing the amount of analysis on and simulation of structural \/ control interactions. Placing additional or tighter controls on key parameters at interfaces between structures and attitude control. Establishing procedures for communicating key parameter data between subsystem engineers and analysts, initially and when changed. In situations where there is significant uncertainty in simulations, models, or analysis results, the spacecraft subsystem software should be designed so as to accommodate changes late in the development, test, and post-launch periods. Techniques such as modular design and parameter tables vs. hard coding should be considered. The capability to cope with this type of anomaly, by analysis and simulation, should be maintained throughout the mission.","Lesson ID":400}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A flight project should invoke a software policy which specifies that no single parameter error or single spacecraft malfunction can lead to a \"deadly embrace\" in the flight software. There should be a rigorous software verification and failure mode analysis conducted at the system level. One subsystem checking on another subsystem's functions should be used only when absolutely necessary. \"Try Again\" responses may be undesirable unless a recovery mode is incorporated.","Lesson ID":369}
{"Recommendation(s)":"End-to-end voltage drop analyses should be conducted during the design phase, using flight component characteristics, to assure that in the worst case condition, voltages at the subsystem power distribution interfaces are within the specified tolerances. Subsystem bench level tests should be performed early using representative external interface circuits to verify adequate performance.","Lesson ID":280}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Whenever honeycomb structures are used an analysis should be conducted of the temperature and ambient pressure profiles that the honeycomb structure will be exposed to during all phases of pre-launch and post-launch activities. It should then be verified to ensure that the honeycomb structure design provides for adequate venting or is structurally capable of withstanding the expected temperature and ambient pressure profiles. The design of the honeycomb structure is verified by conducting a thermal vacuum test that accurately simulates the worst case environment that it will be exposed to during all phases of pre-launch and post-launch activities. The actual pressure vs. time profile that will occur during the worst case environment conditions should be used during this test.","Lesson ID":356}
{"Recommendation(s)":"System tests to determine subsystem compatibility should begin as early as possible using prototype or breadboard hardware. Testing of the system without the subsystem support equipment cables attached should also be conducted as early as possible. It has been found that these cables can alter the flight configuration noise environment considerably. Critical system level interface electrical noise and transient design requirements should be generated early by systems engineering. These should be reviewed and understood by the subsystem design engineers prior to circuit design. Critical subsystems interface circuit design should be reviewed by the system engineer prior to implementation. It is essential that early and extensive interface testing be conducted with as many system loading and flight-like conditions as possible. Where noise immunity is critical, injection of noise on the signal lines during subsystem tests may be necessary to demonstrate adequate margins.","Lesson ID":390}
{"Recommendation(s)":"For payloads of a specified class (particularly those using commercial equipment), one should ensure that the provisions of JPL document D-1489 are met with respect to reviews, problem failure accountability, parts selection, materials and processes, environmental testing, quality assurance, and commercial equipment qualification.","Lesson ID":370}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Each project must thoughtfully establish its own criteria for using the project resource of telecom link performance, based on sufficient pre-launch and in-flight telecom link characterization. Desirable characteristics of a set of criteria include (a) being clear and without ambiguity, (b) having balance between risk, complexity and consequence, and (c) providing a means to measure (compare) the predictions against actual performance. The project must formally authorize the selected criteria, ensure their consistent use among all elements of the project and formally communicate any changes required from further experience.","Lesson ID":375}
{"Recommendation(s)":"If critical components are manufactured and tested and supplied GFE by organizations other than the laboratory, the cognizant development organization should request copies of the test procedures and the data derived from these tests to determine that the equipment meets the project testing requirements. RF breakdown tests should be conducted on all radio frequency generation or amplification and antenna feed system components that are susceptible to breakdown. Test plans should include sufficient system perspective to ensure that the tests are conducted at power levels that demonstrate a margin over the flight power levels and for a period of time commensurate with the planned flight operating duration. End-to-end system tests should be conducted on large complicated systems to verify RF breakdown margins.","Lesson ID":396}
{"Recommendation(s)":"A thorough analysis should be conducted before changes are made to one or more of the flight project elements late in the development cycle where the test program is well advanced or actually may be completed for some of the elements. This analysis should be conducted in concert with designers of the other elements. If discovered after changes are made, these interactions and couplings may (1) reduce the flexibility to make later changes necessary to recover from failures, or (2) negate the opportunity to enhance future science return, or (3) require complicated and costly operational workarounds.","Lesson ID":364}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Maintain a functionally identical, properly configured, test bed of spare spacecraft hardware and associated support equipment, enabling detailed analysis of suspected causes of in-flight faults and validation of proposed corrective actions or workarounds.","Lesson ID":284}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Initiation and sensing circuits must be designed and analyzed with great care to prevent sneak paths which permit unwanted current flows. This is especially true in sensing circuits which could result in anomalous telemetry indications. Post-fire squib shorts must be recognized by the design engineer as a \"normal\" occurrence and should be taken into consideration when designing squib activation or sensing circuits.","Lesson ID":367}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Consider that a spacecraft system design which facilitates on-board algorithm modifications to optimize performance, based on detailed analysis and understanding of the measured inflight spacecraft operational characteristics, allows significant post-launch mission enhancement. Use of spacecraft design which enables utilization of redundant hardware, to increase the sequence software on-board storage capacity, should be considered. Projects should allocate sufficient resources to maintain a complete flight software development and validation capability during long duration missions.","Lesson ID":401}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Sealed flight equipment requiring container integrity should be designed to provide continuous passive indication of leaks by pressurizing above atmospheric pressure and monitoring with pressure transducers to provide evidence of proper pressure and seal integrity. When modifying equipment, care should be taken to ascertain that the as-built configuration is understood. Equipment can be modified by Engineering Change Notices or corrective actions based on Material Review Board decisions.","Lesson ID":393}
{"Recommendation(s)":"All anomalies or indications of potential failure should be thoroughly investigated, analyzed, and if indicated, corrective action should be taken and the results verified. When undertaking research and development experiments with high cost equipment, all modes of possible damage or destruction should be thoroughly analyzed and an assessment made of the risk. When interfacing at the working level with a non-JPL organization that is not responsive to JPL needs or concerns, the problem should be escalated up the JPL management chain to the level where resolution is obtained.","Lesson ID":372}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When cleaning spaceflight components, the cleaning process must be followed by an outgassing vacuum-bake treatment. This is particularly important for porous materials which may have absorbed various fluids, including the cleaning medium itself.","Lesson ID":303}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When cleaning critical spacecraft components, the cleaning fluid should be carefully checked, not just visually, for chemical and particulate contaminants prior to use. The source of the contaminants could be the container or the manufacturing process or both.","Lesson ID":357}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Whenever environmental conditions are specified for a container, the specified parameters should be provided with continuously visible indicating recorders including an alarm feature if limits are exceeded. When a device is operated in a mode which was not contemplated, analysis should be conducted to determine whether this new operational mode could be hazardous to the device or personnel.","Lesson ID":376}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Designers should be aware of tolerance build-up in assemblies and assure that there is adequate margin.","Lesson ID":389}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Before making design changes, related applications should be reviewed for known problems with this solder ball effect. Evaluate each design to determine whether solder can flow into uninspectable areas.","Lesson ID":308}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Any equipment suspected to be sensitive to assembly practices of tolerance build-up should have a worst case analysis to reveal any potential performance anomalies. Consideration should be given to planning for original development engineers to participate as members of the in-flight anomaly recovery team.","Lesson ID":395}
{"Recommendation(s)":"In the design of circuits, all operating modes must be taken into consideration. Relay circuits should be designed so that the circuit can still apply energy to activate relay coils, even if the relay hangs up between contacts.","Lesson ID":282}
{"Recommendation(s)":"During the system design phase, system engineers must be sensitive to the various configurations to be encountered during the system test program.","Lesson ID":378}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The development organization and the project should understand the consequences of an inadequate test program. This understanding is best accomplished by the development organization defining a comprehensive test program, which will verify all design parameters prior to launch. This test program should have sharp justification and be based on a good technical analysis and previous experience. The risks associated with any reduction of testing or the deletion of any test should be clearly documented and communicated to the project. The project in turn should carefully consider the risks to performance and reliability if any subsequent changes are made to the test program due to schedule or budget constraints.","Lesson ID":365}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The projects should allocate enough resources so that JPL personnel can adequately monitor the parts screening methods as well as contractor-specified manufacturing processes and test procedures. Contingency planning for the mission operations phase should take into consideration potential partial failure modes, particularly where functionally redundant units are involved.","Lesson ID":373}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Projects should plan to keep development facilities functional after launch to a level necessary to accomplish inflight troubleshooting. If, for funding reasons, it is necessary to shut down project development facilities after launch, the project should develop a plan with the requisite funding which will reactivate the facility in a very short period of time.","Lesson ID":277}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When designing system and subsystem tests one should carefully consider the environment and its possible effects on the test results. Those environments most likely to influence test results are temperature; electro-magnetic radiation; radio-frequency radiation, reflection and interactions; gravity; and humidity. Care should also be taken to test all components and assemblies prior to the system test so as to detect and correct all performance degradations.","Lesson ID":363}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The project and the DSN must foresee and plan the use of complex and previously unused capabilities sufficiently in advance to allow the proper analysis and configuration testing to be completed. Otherwise, prediction accuracy is degraded.","Lesson ID":374}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Provide an explicit or absolute positioning capability in which the device can be commanded to a specific position, allowing development of sequences in which periodic positioning to absolute locations can be executed.","Lesson ID":279}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The capability to both observe and control movable elements to an appropriate precision (e.g. tape position, platform position, boom position, etc.) Without the possibility of significant error buildup through normal use should be incorporated into the basic spacecraft system design. Specifically, up\/down counters should be used in all bidirectional divide by stages whenever accurate position information is needed.","Lesson ID":380}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Ensure that the back-up real-time ground command system has the necessary capability and flexibility for continuous use during all phases of the mission.","Lesson ID":270}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Lead times of project and institutional planning processes must be considered at the time the project mission operations system implementation plan is being developed.","Lesson ID":278}
{"Recommendation(s)":"When spacecraft mission encounter and post-encounter planning are not completed prior to launch, separate organizations should be established for conducting the cruise activities and accomplishing the encounter planning.","Lesson ID":262}
{"Recommendation(s)":"The telemetry formats should be designed considering all potential analyses that may require time-tagged data.","Lesson ID":307}
{"Recommendation(s)":"Environmentally sensitive hardware must be protected with indicators and alarms from loss or degradation of the environmental control system. Safeguards must also include a method for alerting appropriate personnel in the event of a failure of the environmental control system. If the alerting system does not provide for adequate time for recovery action, redundant systems should be considered. A review of the environmental control system design and implementation by user and facility cognizant personnel should be performed to assure that appropriate safeguards are in place and that they are adequate for the level of protection required. System failure modes should be exercised to check out the safeguards and train the appropriate personnel.","Lesson ID":354}

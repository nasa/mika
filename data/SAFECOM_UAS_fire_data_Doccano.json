There were no suppression aircraft on scene at this time, but a Type 3 helicopter was on order and anticipated beginning of shift on 11-09-2014. Local law enforcement assisting in evacuations was notified at this time as well as the Safety Officer to be on the lookout for the UAS operator. On 11-09-2014 an AS350B3 was on scene assisting in suppression operations. The pilot was told of the UAS sighting, as well as other single engine fixed wing operating the previous day in and around the fire area during initial briefing. A TFR was put in place prior to aerial suppression operations 11-09-2014. Later that day, an individual near the fire line {which was abutting a state highway} was witnessed by the IC with what appeared to be a UAS controlling system. Altitude the UAS was operating at is unknown. Heavy smoke and erratic fire behavior conditions were exhibited at the time of the incident. See attached photo. The IC immediately confronted the individual who admitted to flying a recreational UAS, which prompted the IC to order the individual to immediately cease operation of the UAS, and leave the fire area.  There were aerial suppression operations taking place at the same time and in the same area by the Type 3 helicopter {bucket work}.  Helibase was notified of the situation by the Safety Officer. Information was passed to pilot by HMGB, after the fact as UAS operator was found, confronted, and removed from the scene prior to notification. Local Law enforcement was also notified of the incident and put into contact with the UAS operator.

I contacted the Park Ranger via cell phone to help with the search. The Park Ranger found the two individuals piloting the drone by the front office. The drone pilot grounded the aircraft immediately. I caught up shortly afterwards. The drone was being operated in the flight path of the helicopters. Helibase was notified that the drone was grounded and law enforcement was contacted. The suspects gave us their information and left the scene. Shortly afterwards law enforcement arrived. Law enforcement contacted the two individuals to return to the scene by the cell phone number they provided. Upon return of the suspects the Forest Service LEO interviewed the drone pilot, while recording with his body camera. During his investigate he figured out that the drone was registered and they were aware of the proper procedures for checking the airspace.

I immediately called air attach and informed him that there was a report of a drone preparing to launch near Lucia about 15 miles to the SE of his location and asked him to confirm that it was indeed outside of the fire TFR. The air attack confirmed that the location was 5 miles outside of the TFR. Meanwhile the TFLD that reported the drone turned around and went back to the drone location to talk to the pilot. By the time the TFLD reached the drone location the operator had packed up and left the area. Presumably because he saw the agency vehicle slow down and turn around. I then informed the incident air attack that the drone operator had left the are and was nowhere to be found. About 45 minutes later I received another call about a second drone sighting. This time it was flying inside of the TFR {and in a Condor sanctuary no fly zone} and a quarter mile from where our helicopters were dipping from about an hour before the sighting. I again reported the sighting to airattack who was working with several aircraft up drainage {2.5 miles N @ 4,000 ground elevation} from the drone location {sea level}. I instructed the STLD who reported the drone to solicit the help of the park rangers and confront the drone operator. They were successful in convincing the pilot to land the drone and to stop flying the drone near the fire TFR. Although I asked the STLD to collect any information about the drone and the pilot that he could he was unsuccessful as the pilot made a speedy getaway during a very high road traffic area and time. We immediately made contact with airattack and informed him that the drone had landed and was no longer a factor. An AAR was done the following day using the NWCG UAS Reporting Protocol matrix. Everything was done in the proper sequence and in a timely matter.

Aircraft returned to base after no contact with the UAS operation. Aircraft took appropriate action, providing for safety first. The UAS mission was organized by the local agency representative to the fire.

The AOBD tried to contact the UAS operation but was unable to do so. He then learned that Aircraft had returned to base and within a few minutes that the UAS mission had completed. Identified problems 1. UAS mission planning did not go through normal incident planning which would have captured intent, execution, coordination, and approval of the IC et. al.. 2. While an attempt was made to do the UAS mission right, such as obtaining frequencies and talking with the helicopter pilot and manager to guarantee proper separation, steps were missed such as gaining approval from the IC and access to the TFR through the AOBD or ATGS. 3. OPS gave approval to fly on the fire inside the TFR without the authority to do so. 4. The UAS operator did not respond to radio calls while flying, on command or air to ground, even though the radios had been used prior to flight to talk to OPS. It is unknown why this was the case. The UAS pilot depended on the agency rep to monitor the radio. 5. To obtain the UAS, agency rep had gained permission from the other incidents OPS to borrow the aircraft and operator. The UAS operator sent a text to the other incident aviation staff, which was not received because the cell tower was not working. This meant that the lend\/lease process where the other incident  AOBD would have informed incident AOBD did not occur. 6. The agency rep assumed that if he talked with OPS of each fire to borrow and use the UAS that the OPS would contact and gain necessary approvals and then told the UAS operator that it was okay to fly.   A meeting with the two fire aviation staffs, the UAS operator, the agency rep, the forest aviation officer was held to discuss what went wrong and how to make things better.

Verifying requests, information receipt, etc may mean follow up conversations.

{"Tracking #":"18-0241","Mission Type":"Fire, Air Attack","Text":"Air Attack 1 was working the Prairie Fire about 6 miles NE of Little Falls with FB-201, FB-202, and Helicopter 56BH. Each Fire Boss had made two drops with 56BH continuing to do bucket work. The Pilot of AA1 noticed what he thought was a bird fly underneath the Air Attack platform and above the helicopter that was doing bucket work as AA1 observed from a higher altitude. As the pilot continued to watch the object\u2019s flight he observed that its flight pattern was not consistent with a bird, but that it was instead an UAS quadcopter. AA1 informed 56BH that a UAS had been seen over the fire and 56BH discontinued bucket work and landed at an LZ south of the fire. AA1 repositioned east of the fire and contacted the IC and informed him of the UAS protocol and asked the IC\u2019s assistance in locating the UAS\u2019 operator. The IC made contact with law enforcement and had members of the local fire department that was already on scene to disperse and try to locate the operator. The earlier tanker drops and helicopter bucket work had taken care of most of the running fire. Air Attack 1 contacted HMGB Westerman for an assessment of the fire and his opinion if the ground resources could handle the remaining suppression work. Westerman informed AA1 that in his opinion it could be held with the resources on scene. AA1 contacted IC Butler and relayed the assessment and the IC released AA1. 56BH remained on the ground for approximately 25 minutes after AA1 departed the fire to return to Brainerd TB. The HMGB contacted Brainerd TB and asked that they call the Air Desk to determine the next steps as attempts to locate the drone operator were unsuccessful, and the UAS had not been seen since the initial sighting. Air Desk confirmation was received that if the UAS had not been seen recently, and the operator could not be located, that the flight crew could use their discretion to lift off. The HMGB contacted the IC and confirmed that 56BH was no longer needed on the fire, and that no ground resources, the FD, or law enforcement had seen the UAS airborne. The HMGB let the IC know that 56BH would depart the fire to the south, clear the area as soon as possible, and would not recon. the fire before leaving. Great job on the part of AA1\u2019s pilot maintaining situational awareness and spotting the UAS!  Another reminder that we need to remain vigilant and document all incursions so we can continue our public education and outreach efforts in the hopes of mitigating this issue.  Established procedures were followed and were successful.  UAS incursions in fire airspace have been steadily increasing over the last few years on a nationwide basis. Kudos to Parker the AA pilot on being heads-up and to the AA, IC and HMGB on the incident and to airtanker base and dispatch staff for following the established UAS protocols for deconflicting the airspace and making appropriate notifications to the FAA."}

Before launching we confirmed with helibase there were no other aircraft over the fire and made out Restricted Operations Zone {ROZ} \u201chot\u201d {an area defined where the UAS can climb to altitude before transitioning to the fire}. We launched at 903 from the launch point, climbing in our UAS ROZ. Once established at altitude I notified helibase we were transition to the fire to begin IR mapping, and to turn the ROZ \u201ccold\u201d. We transitioned to the fire at 8500 MSL. For an hour and five minutes we mapped the southern portion of the fire. At about 1008 the flight navigation software on the computer started to freeze, and then crashed. The contractor pilot exited the program and restarted it. It started back up but was frozen and pixelated. This was at about 1012. The contractor pilot then completely shut down and restarted the GCS. The GCS came back online and reconnected with the aircraft which had initiated a return to launch and was circling above us at the same assigned altitude. This was about 1016. The contractor pilot and I discussed recovering the aircraft or finishing up the leg that we missed. The aircraft did exactly what is was supposed to do, it initiated a return to home once it lost link with the GCS at the assigned altitude. We ensured we had good connection and the aircraft was responding correctly and flew a short ways to gather the remaining fire images. We debriefed as a crew on rebooting the system sooner rather than trying to exit out of the flight software and re starting it. Upon further investigation by the contractor pilot, the cause of the freeze and crash was due to continuous video gathering, using up most of the RAM of the computer. By rebooting we cleared and reset the RAM usage. At the next firmware update a default to record to aircraft sim card with an override to save to the computer. We also discussed keeping video logging to short clips saved to the computer."}

Also, battery was falling through 25{{%}} as I descended, resulting in a ``low Battery`` announcement from the GCU. These factors contributed to a lack of focus on controlling the aircraft precisely in an attempt to get it on the ground quickly. As the aircraft drifted in the wind, a series of incorrect directional inputs and over-corrections were made resulting in the contact with the tree. Solo experienced several ``loss of gps`` incidents during that flight and previous flights.  Area was heavily timbered and in steep mountainous terrain.

Neither the Incident Commander, the deputy, or aerial firefighters were aware of the UAS. The county Emergency Planner, aware of the safety risk, thought his emergency response units were aware of the danger a UAS poses to piloted aircraft. Thank you for reporting this incursion. All UAS pose a great risk to flight crews regardless of the UAS```` mission and size. MN DNR is in the very early stages of UAS use and on occasion it may be necessary to utilize another agency````s UAS. Any activity with UAS needs to be approved by the Wildfire Aviation Supervisor or delegate, coordinated with the IC, and notification provided to aircraft on the incident. The best practice for UAS is to wait until the initial attack efforts are completed. Unauthorized operations of UAS which endanger manned aircraft are illegal and punishable by law. A Safety Alert was created and shared with Law Enforcement, Fire Departments, and Emergency Managers in addition to the press release regarding UAS. A similar event occurred in April, 2015 which was the catalyst for similar outreach to the MN State Fire Marshalls Office.

{"Tracking #":"19-0447","Mission Type":"Fire, Infrared Imagery","Text":"The Type 2 UAS was ordered for a number of fires in and around the XXX Wilderness on the XXX of the XXX National Forest. The mission was to detect any heat remaining on the fires, map their perimeters, and provide imagery to local fire managers. The day before the mishap, a flight was conducted on a fire that went smoothly. On the second day, a similar mission was planned over a different fire. A thorough safety and operational briefing took place prior to launch with all members of the mission. The only difference in this mission and the previous day`s was the location of the fire and the placement of the launch area. The UAS flew over the fire for just over an hour collecting data before the Pilot in Charge {PIC} began the procedures for landing. On final and while flying on an automated flight plan, the UAS aggressively changed its angle of attack and pitched down. The UAS impacted the ground at this angle one-quarter of a mile from the intended landing zone. The fuselage, leading edges of the wings, and tail boom all sustained significant damage leading to the aircraft being deemed not airworthy. The angle of attack change is normal for this aircraft on approach to its landing zone. The crash was due to an incorrect input into the Ground Control Station {GCS} of the landing zone elevation. This elevation was gained from a new GPS out of the box. The input into the GCS was 5915 and the actual elevation of the landing zone is 6280. This incorrect input made the aircraft believe that it was over 300 feet higher and continue with this angle of attack prior to leveling off for landing. The PIC and flight crew will double check inputs into the GCS prior to launch to verify that they are correct.  Correct elevation will be gained from more than one source.  If you are using a new GPS, cross-reference with a GPS that is known to be accurate."}

At 49 percent battery life the Pilot started his return flight. The Fire was about 2000 vertical feet above launch point so as the pilot flew back to the launch point he was descending. The Visual observer stated he lost visual with the aircraft and to stop descending. Pilot stopped descending and continued to fly at the current altitude towards the launch point. Shortly after that Visual Observer heard a audible ``smack`` and pilot lost connection to the aircraft. Both Pilot and Visual Observer determined Aircraft had hit something {assumed a tree}. Due to the time of day Pilot and Visual observer decided to hike off the hill and return the next day to locate the Aircraft. The next day Pilot hiked up to the last know location of the UAS as recorded on the Flight Controller app. Do to limited Cell phone service until he gained elevation and the late night before and early start that morning notifications were not made until approximately 0800 on 8\/15 when pilot hiked high enough to gain cell service.

Two of the Rotors were damaged but other than that the aircraft had no visual damage. Further tests and inspections will need to be done before the aircraft is returned to service. The UASP and UASP{T} spoke extensively about the mission and the decisions that were made that led up to the accident. The correct action would have been to have gained elevation until line of site was reestablished before continuing flight back to Launch zone. The pilots decision to continue to fly at present altitude and not climb was influenced by the amount of battery life left on the aircraft and previous experience with 3DR batteries. The UAPS and UASP{T} felt that all the decisions that were made up to that point were sound risk management decisions including picking a launch site that was not the initial planned launch site to allow them to be closer to the fire but at a lower elevation and to delay the start of the mission until early evening when winds were minimal. Neither the UASP or UASP{T} felt that there was any pressure to complete the mission and that they maintained a high focus on risk management throughout all of the flights."}

The UASM checked the TFR information and found that there was no TFR in effect when the observed aircraft entered the airspace where Unmanned FXXX was operating.\r\nThe original TFR boundary was extended by the airspace coordinator earlier in the day on June 11, 2020 to accommodate large air tanker operations.   Later during the operational shift on June 11, 2020, Air Traffic Control (ATC) contacted the airspace coordinator to establish a new TFR in order to better accommodate airport traffic operations.\r\nThe Fire\u2019s Air Operations Branch Director contacted the airspace coordinator directly to discuss the TFR creation process and establish why TFR coverage was not in effect for the planned 24-hour period.  The 24-hour TFR coverage was established to provide safe airspace for the planned nighttime UAS operations on the Fire.\r\nThe airspace coordinator investigated the issue and discovered that both TFRs were, in fact, noted to provide 24-hour coverage over the Fire.  The gap in 24-hour coverage resulted after the first TFR  was effectively canceled at 2100 hours on June 11, 2020.  The new TFR  was created and was noted to provide 24-hour coverage.  However, the new TFR would not take effect until 0600 hours on June 12, 2020.

We did not see the drone for the rest of the day. Once we heard that there was a drone sighted at the fire, near Helispot 50, we immediately started communicating with everyone (Fire, Dispatch and Law Enforcement personnel) and started looking and searching for the drone and operator. Throughout the day we continued monitoring for the drone.\r\nIRAM South: Fire personnel were somewhat unsure of  protocol for drone incursion of their aviation operation. Discussion of protocol and notifications required occurred and greater awareness is in place. No further action."}

{"Tracking #":"20-0872","Mission Type":"Fire, Aerial Ignition","Text":"During UAS aerial ignition operations on the Pine Gulch fire we encountered a hang fire on the Ignis 2 PSD machine. The event occurred while pilot (UASP Aerial Ignition Trainee) and Visual Observer (Qualified UASP Aerial Igniton) were conducting UAS aerial firing operations on the night shift of the Pine Gulch Fire. The UASP flew to the area of the burnout and successfully completed the first leg of the burn pattern dropping  30 balls. The UASP was repositioning to initiate another leg of  firing when the aircraft gave a hatch motion error and puncture motion error. The VO assisted the pilot in resetting the Ignis per protocol. After reset the error became a red error signifying that it was unrecoverable in flight. The visual observer\/qualified operator noticed that there appeared to be some form of heat signature visible through the camera that was not expected. He stated he believed there was hang fire in the dropper and took control of the aircraft controller. He then turned the camera to look directly at the Ignis 2 machine and visually confirmed fire in the dropper. He successfully initiated emergency procedure using the radio controller to detach the dropper from the hopper. The IGNIS 2 functioned as designed and the hang fire was separated from the hopper. The UASP remained over the ignition area swinging the jettisoned dropper to visually ensure that fire was extinguished in the dropper for approximately 2 minutes before flying back to landing area. Upon inspection of the aircraft and PSD machine, the melted sphere was still in the dropper. Minimal heat damage was noticed on one of the hopper hatches. No other damage was noticed. The machine was cleaned and bench tested, then flight tested before further use.\r\n\r\nAn AAR was conducted discussing what happened and how it was mitigated with the entire module. A good discussion was had regarding the procedures to follow when a unrecoverable error occurs in flight. Including immediately using the camera to identify any situations that would require the jettisoning of the slipper block and the need to ensure that you do not leave the fire area when there is potential to spread fire beyond the planned ignition area.\r\n\r\nThe next night another UASP had a hang fire, but the ball was witnessed to fall from the released dropper.  Pilot returned to the LZ without incident and the aircraft\/IGNIS was inspected and returned to service.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge these are the first hang fires to happen in over 100,000 balls dropped. An AAR was conducted discussing what happened and how it was mitigated with the entire module. A good discussion was had regarding the procedures to follow when an unrecoverable error occurs in flight. Including immediately using the camera to identify any situations that would require the jettisoning of the dropper from the hopper and the need to ensure that you do not leave the fire area when there is potential to spread fire beyond the planned ignition area.\r\n\r\nThe ball spacing is derived from the IGNIS App based on distance.   The machine will not drop if not moving.   The machine will drop at the defined distance the operator sets in the IGNIS App.\r\n\r\nDuring both hang fire events the ball spacing was set to 0ft to put as much fire on the ground as possible.\r\n\r\nAs a corrective action it was decided to adjust the spacing drop rate from 0 to 13 ft.    It is assumed the machine was having a hard time \"keeping up\" with such a fast drop rate.  We will monitor the change and report the findings to the community of UASP PSD operators.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer was notified as concurred with the corrective action."}
{"Tracking #":"20-0949","Mission Type":"Fire, Aerial Ignition","Text":"Upon attempting to land after conducting night aerial ignitions the aircraft collided with a tree, tilted and fell about 15' to the ground. The aircraft incurred broken props, broken arm locking tabs, and a broken landing leg. The Ignis housing was cracked around the 3D printed plastic main body. The pilot stated that he had lost perspective of the aircraft position and the pad. He also said that he could not see the tree line as it blended in with the darkness. There was very little natural illumination and we were using truck headlights to light up the pad.  There was discussion about how the truck headlights had possibly obscured the pilots night vision and made it more difficult to pick out the tree line. The previous nights we had used a hand held LED light to spot the aircraft while incoming and to spot the pad while causing less washout. To correct for the loss of perspective for night landing we discussed having the visual observer 90 degrees off of the landing pad and the pilot so he could assist with ensuring obstacle clearance. It was also discussed using the camera to confirm location before descending.  \r\n\r\nRASM:  It is confirmed that in fact this is not a reportable accident due to no damage to property, other than the sUAS, or injury to persons; rule is specific to UAS.  After the incident, the team did exactly what they are supposed to and should do, analysis & self-analysis.  They deserve credit for practicing that notion, to continue to improve and correct, individual and program advancement.  The corrective actions are accurate but some \u201cfood for thought\u201d and \u201cthinking out loud\u201d is offered in addition, and they are just that.  Now that we are finding both the need and the authorization to fly at night, a strong suggestion is to expand aviation training for the interagency UAS community to include, what is particular to this case, a robust night flying learning package.  There are so many aspects of night flying and the resulting tactics, techniques and procedures that we can take advantage of for further skill development.  In fact, the agencies ought to own an obligation to provide them with all the tools possible.  A fair amount of night flying incorporates compensation and it sounds like this group is successfully doing that but possibly keenly figuring it out on their own, and they are actually doing a good job of it.  But are we leaving too much up to discovery learning?  This training can try to avoid that and help further develop those skills.   There were some things going on that night that this teaching may have had the crews better prepared for; the darkness of a moonless night, the black of an already burned area, the scorched black (invisible) snag tree, adjusting by using artificial illumination, trying to wash out competing and obstructing artificial light and more.  A pure UAS pilot might not otherwise have a night flying proficiency like a maned aircraft pilot would have established.  Too many subjects to list here completely but the following are mentioned.  Visual Illusions, blind spots (and how to counter them), off center viewing, minimum altitudes, vertical climbs and descents to and from those altitudes when necessary, night vision, protecting night vision, artificial illumination, different types of artificial illumination, natural light and how to use it all of them to your advantage and how to avoid & counter it to your advantage (intentional washing out to mention just one), UAS\u2019s version of a cross between VFR & IFR (a true vertical assent\/decent, perhaps return to home and auto land) and human factors particular to night flying.  A lot more can be covered here but certainly for this discussion a resource for skill improvement and growth, individually and for the greater program.  As we broaden in missions, so to do we need to mature in exposure and training.  There is formal education in this area, a discipline within a discipline of sorts; we might capitalize on it and order the tools this community should have.\r\n"}

The Unmanned Romeo XXX (URXXX, a Matrice 600), was engaged in aerial ignition near DP 10, and  the helicopter was working in a daisy chain of 3 helicopters supporting firefighters on the ground with bucket drops. Both aircraft were operating in Division T on the Woodward Fire near the Bear Valley Visitor\u2019s Center (refer to map below).  Aerial supervision was in place and both aircraft were made aware of the presence of the other.   Helicopters were given a specific route to\/from the dip and the sUAS was also provided a specific area to operate in.  \r\n\r\nAt approximately 1815 the pilot of the incident helicopter approached the vicinity of DP10, on his way to drop water on the fire.  The aircraft was on the designated route and was climbing from the dip to 1500 ft. MSL over the marine layer to the clear air, when he encountered visual contact with URXXX approximately 100 feet below.  URXXX was in a stationary hover over the marine layer at the time of the encounter. \r\n\r\nThe 1000 ft AGL clearance over the highest terrain feature had positioned URXXX at approximately 1400 MSL, near the altitude where helicopters were operating.  The pilot of the helicopter altered course slightly to the right and passed by the UAV.  The helicopter pilot estimated the UAV to be at about the same altitude as the bucket, and about 100 ft horizontally to the left.  The helicopter continued on the designated route and descended to complete the drop.  Both the sUAS pilot and the helicopter pilot notified Air Attack, who halted the sUAS operation. \r\nConnection to the URXXX was momentarily lost during aerial ignition operations.  The sUAV was at 38% battery life, and reconnection to the aircraft was unsuccessful after several attempts by the operator. The sUAV pilot selected the \u201cGo Home\u201d button to initiate the lost link procedure. The aircraft was observed, by the helicopter pilot, hovering (stationary) at around 1400 ft. during the time of the signal interruption.   URXXX\u2019s visual observer and pilot continued to look for the sUAV with no immediate success. URXXX was finally heard overhead of the original takeoff and landing area at DP10.  The pilot then depressed the \u201cGo Home\u201d button again regain control. The sUAV pilot then maneuvered URXXX to the south of DP10 to clear the smoke and marine layer and to regain a visual of the aircraft. URXXX was located to the south of DP10 and the pilot began descending the aircraft by pitching forward to the landing area south of DP10.  The aircraft was landed without further incident. The sUAS pilot, the incident aviation managers, the helicopter pilot and the air attack all reviewed and discussed this situation to determine what could be done to prevent a similar event.  The following are the contributing factors and on-site recommendations: \r\nFactors contributing to this incident:\r\n1.\tUnmanned Romeo operating at altitudes assigned in AGL; other incident Aircraft operating with altitudes assigned at MSL\r\n2.\tPoor visibility due to smoke and persistent marine layer\r\n3.\tClose operating proximity\r\nWhat went well:\r\n1.\tsUAS pilot immediately notified Air Attack, and shut down operation once the aircraft was back at the LZ\r\n2.\tsUAS Pilot followed all emergency procedures for loss of contact with UAV, IAW the manual\r\n3.\tsUAS Pilot notified Incident Aviation Managers (AOBD) in a timely manner \r\n4.\tHelicopter Pilot practiced see and avoid\r\n5.\tAll parties discussed this occurrence and provided input for this report\r\nRecommendations:\r\n1.\tAll incident aircraft should operate at MSL, rather than AGL.  This will ensure all incident aircraft are operating at the same altitude clearances.

During the breakdown we noticed at 1953 a low flying commercial aircraft fly what seemed to be within our 0\/0961 TFR 1\/4 mile to the North of us. I immediately took a screen shot of my already open flightradar24 app. It showed Delta flight 988 at 9,286 msl.  It was a non-event as we were on the ground.  I called the ASGS (t) and sent him a screenshot. He spoke with Spokane approach and let them know.  The following morning, I made a follow-up call to Spokane prior to launch at the same LRZ. The supervisor was unaware. I received a follow-up call a short time later and was told that our TFR indeed was breached by Delta 988 and exited our TFR at 8,600.  I was concerned that this may happen again tonight. This is most likely a daily flight and if it happened again, we may be in the same airspace at the same time, as we are planning a similar mission.  I also asked if I needed to have a daily call into them prior to launch and recovery. I was assured that it was not necessary as it will not happen again. It is important to have the flightradar24 app to identify aircraft type, tail number, speed and altitude if you see or hear an aircraft that may be in your vicinity. Taking a screenshot can save a lot of time for reporting. We reached out to Spokane approach and were assured that it will not be an issue in the future.  We will continue to monitor our airspace, especially during climb and decent.\r\nRASM comments:  I am appreciative of all the quick communications which took place over this intrusion.  Nice job by the manger to think quickly and use his flightradar24 app.  This intrusion was run to ground very well.  The Natl Airspace Coordinator worked with FAA, Salt Lake Center, and Spokane Approach Control while I worked with Delta Airlines.  It seems all the loops were closed on this from the UAS, AOBD, ASCO, Natl ASCO, Dispatch, GACC, and RASM to the FAA, Center, Approach and Airlines.  Even though good communications took place and the root of this cause was Approach Control dropping the ball, we still must always stay vigilant.

The public launches them to gather footage, and the media routinely collects video for news coverage reporting current conditions.  There are many reasons to use drones.\r\nThe xxx Creek Fire, since the wind event, has been under very poor visibility which has grounded our manned aviation operation, however we have been collecting some intel from a fire controlled UAS.  A TFR has been over the fire steady with the exception of one afternoon where it was cancelled to facilitate an adjacent fire posting their new TFR.\r\nOnly one agency has asked permission to fly in our TFR on private lands to collect information to facilitate their mission.  Another similar agency has produced video footage and has expressed no interest in working with the fire aviation program to communicate or meet FAA rules.  I am finding many do not fully comprehend the complexity of a fire aviation program, airspace coordination and the communication with players such, as ATGS who direct operations and set priorities.  This lack of understanding can place our pilots, and manned and unmanned aircraft at risk.

Leading up the incident, there had been continual communication issues that led to misunderstandings about UAS operations and capabilities.  On the morning of 28 SEP 20 the UAS Module arrived at Helibase and prepared the GCS (Ground Control Station) for operations.  Original GCS was located on the road downslope of the pads.  The Helitack crew arrived before GCS was established. A  helitack crewmember specified that Pad 3 would be designated for Take-Off\/Landing.  Crewmember also verified this operational plan with his Squad Leader. Squad leader concurred.  After deliberating, the UAS module chose to utilize pad 3 and also briefed emergency procedures for GCS movement in case pad 3 needed to be utilized.  \r\nAfter initial contact with ATGS, UAS PIC was told to hold position to allow for H-XXX to land on Pad 1.  H-XXX landed on pad 1, and UAS was cleared for T\/O.  Positive communication was made with Castle ATGS,  and Helibase.

{"Tracking #":"21-0015","Mission Type":"Fire, Infrared Imagery","Text":"During post-recovery inspection of the UAS after a reconnaissance mission, it was observed that the cowling on the aircraft was missing.  This is a protective cover for the UAS engine from dirt and debris during launch and recovery.  The cowling is attached to the aircraft using magnets.  During the flight, there were periods of turbulence and high winds aloft.  The pilot believes that at some point during the mission, winds funneled under the cowling and the magnets did not hold.  Upon further inspection, when the cowling came off, it contacted the push propeller of the aircraft and created a small nick.  The aircraft performed normal with the small damage.   The pilot determined that the cowling was not needed during future missions if the dirt and debris during launch and recovery could be mitigated.  To mitigate the problem, a large tarp was placed on the ground creating a barrier on the landing area that could trap the dirt and debris from getting to the engine.  The damaged push propeller was replaced and conversations with the manufacturer will take place to replace the magnets with a better option."}

{"Tracking #":"21-0138","Mission Type":"Fire, Other","Text":"The Parrot Anafi was flying an autonomous mapping mission, using Pix4D Capture as the GCS.  Aircraft was 3\/4 of the way through the first transect when the pilot noticed the GCS indicated that the aircraft had stopped taking photos momentarily, but then resumed taking photos at the end of the transect.  The aircraft completed the first transect (flying south), then turned to the west to move to the next transect, but continued moving to the west and missed the turn back to the north.  Upon seeing the aircraft go off course, the pilot cancelled autonomous flight mode and attempted to regain manual flight control.  GCS indicated that the aircraft was responsive to command inputs and did yaw, but did not respond to pitch commands and it continued to move to the west.  Pilot attempted to initiate \"return to home\" mode using GCS, but aircraft did not respond.  Pilot used remote controller to begin aircraft descent.  Aircraft descended from 400 ft. to 330 ft., before the signal was lost.  Pilot and crew went to the last known location of the aircraft but did not find it, nor could they re-establish signal link to attempt and track it using the GCS.  At the last known location, the aircraft reported 60% battery.  After the fly away and loss of link event, the GCS reported \"0\" GPS satellites.  It is unknown if GPS signal was lost during flight, or if the GPS signal went to zero after the loss of link, as the pilot did not look at the GPS signal indicator when attempting to recover aircraft while controller still had signal link with the aircraft.  Based on the above information, the pilot assumes that the aircraft did lose GPS signal while in autonomous flight.  It did respond to manual input, for a brief period, but did not respond to \"return to home\" mode, which requires GPS signal.  It also did not return to home after leaving the geofence-limited area.  Winds were moderate (gusting to 15mph at the surface), but within aircraft limitations.  However, the delay from the time the aircraft first went off course to the time the pilot attempted to recover the aircraft may have been sufficient to allow the wind to carry the aircraft out of signal range.    While a definitive cause of the \u201cfly away\u201d event is uncertain, several factors may have contributed to it.  First, the pilot had never experienced GPS signal loss with the Parrot Anafi, nor even heard any other instances, which created a sense of complacency that the GPS \u201calways works\u201d on the Anafi\u2026 until it doesn\u2019t.  The chance of it happening should have been anticipated and pro-active steps should have been taken to prepare for it.   The GPS on the Anafi can\u2019t be turned off to practice manual flight, but proficiency flights should simulate GPS failure situations, to keep up the awareness level of the situation with both the pilot and crew.  \r\nSecondly, while there is a pre-flight and post-flight checklist to ensure important steps are not missed, there was not an in-flight emergency checklist to follow to help guide the actions of the crew.  An in-flight emergency checklist, specific for each model of aircraft and each GCS due to variations in operability, should be part of a pilot\u2019s standard checklist.  Having written instructions, easily accessible by the crew, will allow crewmembers to cue the pilot about what sequence of steps should be initiated.  During a stressful incident, i.e. an aircraft fly-away, a procedure checklist to follow will serve a pilot better than their fallible memory, since each aircraft and each GCS perform differently.  \r\nFinally, on-going training (practice flights) would improve muscle memory of what actions to initiate during emergency operations.  In addition to routine proficiency flight, emergency exercises and scenarios should be implemented regularly to maintain preparedness levels.  Since April of this year, the pilot has only flown during emergency responses.  A failure to practice is a practice of failure."}

This was the 11th flight since maintenance had been completed, however this flight was with a fully loaded Ignis machine to conduct aerial ignition.  On the first UAS PSD mission for this particular m600 since new motor mount replacement, approximately 1 minute into flight, aircraft went into uncontrolled yaw that resulted in loss of control and impacted terrain.  Remote pilot recognized issue from past UAS motor separation incidents as aircraft was still in view and lowered lander gear with full accent input to try to slow decent rate.  Aircraft impacted the ground damaging landing gear and motors but without significant damage to payloads.  Proper notifications were made.\r\nThe aircraft was located and the motor was dangling from the motor mount via wires. Evidence of motor mount separation was evident. This strongly suggests that the motor broke free of the motor housing during flight.\r\n Mitigations:\r\nReduce the payload weight by reduction of number of balls to 250 and amount of glycol to 3\/4 full when able.\r\nAll PPE will be used by ground crews during PSD operations.\r\nNo flights over people.\r\nMinimize aggressive throttle and\/or pitch\/roll maneuvers.\r\nIf uncontrolled descent is occurring, immediately lower landing gear and go to max climb rate to slow the descent rate.\r\nBe overly vigilant with pre-flight inspections.\r\nInvestigate potential motor mount replacements from third party vendors.\r\n\r\nRASM:  Completely concur with above corrective actions.  The pilot and rest of the team deserve acknowledgement for reacting quickly in the moment but also for developing strong field countermeasures in real time and for the impending future.  While reducing the payload (reducing the max gross weight) works in the field, it is a short term fixe because it would seem the aircraft does not actually perform as advertised \/ designed and to expectations.  But, all the people in the FS and DOI UAS community are very passionate and known for, but also credited with even now, working towards what is needed for the long term, but also for any success that the Interagency UAS Program might realize.

{"Tracking #":"21-0172","Mission Type":"Fire, Reconnaissance","Text":"A Parrot Anafi Thermal was in use for situational awareness during a prescribed burn.  The pilot had already completed three flights that day, with minimal issues.  During the second flight, the GCS indicated that the signal between controller and aircraft was weak, and \u201cReturn to Home\u201d would be initiated soon, but pilot increased altitude and the signal improved, and RTH was not initiated.  Prior to take off for the third flight, both the controller and aircraft GPS signal did not lock (did not turn green).  After waiting 1-2 minutes, and repositioning the aircraft, both GPS remained red.  The aircraft was rebooted, and shortly after that, both GPS turned green.  There were no anomalies during the third flight.  During the fourth flight, no issues were noted prior to take-off or during the first 15 minutes of flight, but at about 15 minutes the controller provided haptic feedback and indicated that the aircraft GPS signal was lost, and the aircraft was auto-landing in place.  The GCS did not provide an option to cancel the auto-landing.  The pilot attempted to break out of the auto-landing by providing various control inputs (climb, pitch forward, yaw, return to home), but the aircraft did not respond and the video feed was lost as it descended below the tree line and out of sight.   The pilot was driven to within 500 feet of the last known location of the aircraft, as noted by the GCS, but the aircraft did not reconnect with the GCS.  The pilot and members of the fire crew performed a search of the area, but the suspected landing area was a pine forest with a thick under story of saw palmetto, and the aircraft was not recovered.  At the time the aircraft descended, the area beneath it was green, but within an hour, the advancing fire burned over much of the area.  \r\nThe GCS app in use for all flights was the Parrot FreeFlight 6 app.  All flights conducted in manual flight mode.  Prior to all flights, the safety settings on the GCS were verified that the aircraft would Return to Home and land In case of signal loss (and not land in place or hover in place).  A geofence of .7 miles was set to keep the aircraft within its specified flight range.  The aircraft was within line of sight of the pilot at all times, maintaining a position above the tree line, and the pilot had eyes on aircraft at the time the GCS indicated the GPS signal loss.  The last known location of the aircraft was approximately 2400 feet from the pilot, and there was no indication that the radio signal was weak (no on-screen warning) prior to the auto-land activating, nor during any telemetry checks during the flight.  The issue during the second flight with a weak signal seems to confirm that the aircraft would return to home if it lost signal, but evidence suggests the aircraft lost both GPS signal and the radio signal to the GCS at the same time.    \r\n Without flight log data from the aircraft, the cause of the auto-land remains unknown.  There is no information in the manual concerning loss of GPS events, and no way to simulate it occurring mid-flight.  Ideally, further testing of RTH due to loss of link, in a controlled environment, should be conducted to see if the issue can be replicated. \r\n\r\nPilot performed as qualified and operated the sUAS appropriately.  As technological anomalies will happen, sUAS pilots should always consider all trouble shooting options and system functionality tests.\r\n\r\nsUAS operators should explore all options possible for locating downed sUAS aircraft.

Approximately 3.5 hours later, at 15:38, Helicopter XXX called Dispatch to announce that they would be flying a reconnaissance mission over the fire. At 15:49, the UAS operator called in to let us know that Unmanned Romeo was on the ground and they would let us know when they lifted again. When Helicopter XXX landed, shortly after 16:00, Dispatch received a call from the IC that the UAS crew had some concerns that Dispatch did not alert them that the Helicopter was about to fly over the Fire. After consulting NWCG document PMS 515 (NWCG Standards for Fire Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations), it appeared that mission flights should be coordinated \"with participating aircraft when aerial supervision is not on scene.\" (p. 4) Further consultation with the Forest FAO led to a discussion about the role of Dispatch during an operational flight on an extended attack fire. It was decided that Dispatch should call all the aircraft and confirm that they are aware of UAS operations in the area or call to confirm that the UAS is on the ground. In the end, this was a learning experience about UAS protocols. We (dispatch) familiarized ourselves with PMS 515 and had some good discussions about potential scenarios.  Ultimately, clear communication was identified as the key to successful operations. Arrival of a UAS on a fire is a trigger point that protocols for airspace coordination will need to be established. It is still not completely clear if there is a standard is for this situation or if protocols will be developed on a case-by-case basis. Another miscommunication: the logs for 6\/11 indicated that the UAS and Helicopter would NOT be in the air at the same time. (It's not believed that they were ever in the air together) It was also realized that we didn't really have a clear plan for monitoring the UAS flight (no AFF or timers). Another discussion that arose is whether a qualified aircraft dispatcher is required to track UAS activity, especially during night operations, when staff may be limited. In sum, this was a valuable learning experience that brought up many new questions related to UAS operations and opened our eyes to potential issues. Going forward, we recommend wider distribution of PMS 515 and other UAS operational documents as well as more training and discussion about standard operating procedures."}

{"Tracking #":"21-0566","Mission Type":"Fire, Infrared Imagery","Text":"I was flying the IR mission for the afternoon, when the mishap occurred.  I had taken off and landed two times previously while completing the requested IR missions for the fire we were on.  Upon landing for the third time, I brought the M600 down onto the landing platform.  After the M600 was solidly on the platform, I brought the left stick down and in to disarm the motors.  As I did that, I also brought the right stick down and in.  This caused the UAS to tip backwards off of the platform and into the grass and shrubs.  One of the six propellers broke when this happened.  Additionally, two of the red tabs that lock the arms into the frame of the UAS body broke off.  We replaced the propellers and red tabs and closely inspected the rest of the UAS for any other damage.  Finding none, we called the AFS UAS Specialist and reported what had just happened.  After conferring with the UAS Specialist, all agreed that we should connect the controller to the UAS and make sure that everything seemed to be working correctly.  We did that, and went through the start up sequence to the point of arming the motors.  Everything appeared to functioning normally.  We disarmed the motors and shut the UAS down.   There are two parts to this Safecom.  The first is the actual event where the UAS tipped over, and the second is a discussion on the BLM guidance for UAS training on new platforms.  My intent with submitting this Safecom is that we may learn from both parts.\r\n\r\nThe tip over:\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to my computer the following day, I reviewed the M600 manual to see what I had done wrong, since I didn\u2019t feel like I had changed anything in my landing and disarming procedure from the first two flights, to the third, where the tip over occurred.  \r\nWhile pulling both controller sticks down and in is an approved method for disarming the M600 as stated in the M600 manual, it is a much riskier procedure, as was evidenced by the tip over.  If the motors are not at full idle prior to bring the right stick down and in, there is still enough power in the propellers to provide pitch and roll to the aircraft.  So while I felt like I did the same maneuver for disarming each time, I must have been a little quicker with the right controller stick input on the third landing, than on the first two landings.  This has a very simple remedy.\r\nThe M600 manual also recommends that the UAS be disarmed by using the left control stick only in the down position.  The motors take 3 seconds to power down using this method, but there is no chance for any additional pitch or roll inputs when using the left stick down method.  So, this was a good learning moment for me, and hopefully, others can learn from it as well without having to an M600 over.  \r\n\r\nAdd-on training guidance:\r\n\r\nAfter the events of the day, and after numerous phone calls were made to discuss what had happened, it became clear to me that there was a lack of clarity regarding the UAS guidance for this particular situation that we were in.  One of the questions that came up was whether or not the fully qualified UAS pilot I was flying with on the fire was able to train me on the M600 platform.  Below is an excerpt from the OAS Sharepoint site that provides guidance for training UAS pilots on new platforms. (Since OPM-11 doesn\u2019t directly address Add-on training, and I don\u2019t think there is any specific BLM guidance, I believe the OAS Sharepoint site is the most current language for how the Bureaus intend to operate).\r\n\u201cBureau Instructors will be able to provide A-454 Aircraft Add-on training to carded DOI remote pilots that need a specific \u201cmake and model\u201d added to their OAS-30U card. Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List with an endorsement for A-454 Add-On Training and for the aircraft being evaluated may train and recommend additional aircraft qualifications.\u201d\r\nAfter reading the above statement, I believed that Bureau Instructors were one group of people, and that Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List were another group of people, and it made sense to me.  It seemed very analogous to the manned aviation process for add-on training.  Last summer I did some add-on training for my private pilot\u2019s license when I took a 3 day course to get my float rating.  I was trained each day by a CFI (certified flight instructor), and she taught me how to fly on floats.  She could not however, sign me off as being certified for my float rating.  The DPE (designated pilot examiner) had to do that.  So, when I read the above referenced OAS language, I saw the parallel within that language to how manned aviation worked.  Bureau instructors (CFI\u2019s on the manned aviation side) could train pilots how to fly a new aircraft, and Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List were the ones who could certify that those pilots learning to fly a new aircraft were indeed good to go (the role of the DPE on the manned aviation side).  This also fit nicely with how the Position Task Book system is set up.  Individuals who are Qualified in a position are the ones who train trainees for that position.  \r\nAfter many conversations with a number of folks, I came to understand that this wasn\u2019t the interpretation of the guidance that the Bureau was operating under.  Some folks at the national program level were unclear about how the guidance should be interpreted, but it seemed the majority believed that \u201cBureau instructors\u201d and \u201cRemote pilots on the Master Instructor List\u201d were the same group of people, not two separate groups.\r\nWhat this shows me is that we have an opportunity to clarify the guidance.  Anytime there is enough uncertainty in policy language or bureau guidance, there lies an opportunity to help fix it for everyone in the future.  The intent may be clear to those who are immersed in the program, but if I was able to misinterpret it, others will likely do so as well.  \r\n\r\n"}

Fixed wing and rotary wing operations where suspended in the area and aircraft where held out.  Air attack was able to follow the drone from a safe distance as it made right hand turns into the fire interior.

Tactical Aviation Operations (TAO) Comments: This was the second UAS incursion in the same area near Rock Creek. The first was 3-5 days earlier during the IA period (SAFECOM 21-0571). Known FAA 107 Violations: Flying in a TFR, above 400 AGL, beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) and without a visual observer. Agency violations: Not in compliance with interagency UAS incident operational standards. More on this incident: Unknown color, size, or type as it was small; the giveaway identification was the strobe flashing on top. ATGS estimated the UAS at 1000 AGL. Ops and AOBD were notified and the Branch supervising the geographic area made a radio announcement to resources that no UAS missions were authorized. The notification process was followed appropriately. There was a rumor on the incident that it was possible that the UAS was being operated, unauthorized, by an incident resource. (There were authorized USFS UAS flight approved for night ops on the fire). To mitigate future possibilities of unauthorized use a \"no UAS operations are to occur without AOBD approval\" reminder will be included in the daily incident briefing. During this incident all aircraft had good separation from the UAS while it was being monitored.  To further mitigate the source, the air attack dedicated a short available period of time to attempting to locate the UAS operator. They orbited over the area of Rock Creek (at a safe altitude) with the intention to indicate to the remote pilot that they were aware of their activity, while also attempting to identify them. (A good tip is to look for parked vehicles with two or more stationary individuals staring down at a screen instead of watching firefighting operations).  Attached is an updated NWCG UAS Incursion Protocol, which expands on the reporting items to add: known location of operators, type\/details of UAS (rotor\/fixed wing, shape, size, color(s)).  Additionally, here are the guidelines from the FAA on the reporting of illegal UAS operations: If you witness a drone operation that appears dangerous or is being used to commit a crime please report it immediately to your local law enforcement first responders. They can protect public safety and can help discourage dangerous or illegal activities.  If you witness a drone not following FAA rules, you may reach out to your local FAA flight standards district office. The FAA's investigators may be able to investigate your report and follow up with the drone operator. Unauthorized drone operators may be subject to penalties and criminal charges.\r\n"}

{"Tracking #":"21-0774","Mission Type":"Fire, Infrared Imagery","Text":"South Yaak Fire.  July 29th 2021\r\nUAS was on Div U to assist with aerial ignitions and gridding\/patrolling for spot fires during a burnout operation.  Prior to this incident, UAS had conducted 22 flights from this location.  \r\nThe crews started burning at approximately 10:30. The burnout was progressing from the DP132 area to the Div U\/T break.  Div U had requested UAS to provide IR flights to assist the holding resources with identifying spot fires.  The UAS was being flown from a large meadow approximately 2000ft from the fire line. UAS was given clearance to operate 5,500ft and below on altimeter 30.12 from DP 132 to the Div U\/T break.  AA also informed UAS that there was a Type 2 helicopter working to the south in Div T and a Type 1 working in Div W.  UAS was requesting clearance before each flight.  This flight occurred at 16:27.   \r\nApproximately 12 minutes into the flight I heard a helicopter coming in from the north.  I told the UASP(t) to descend to the treetops and return to the launch area.  From my location the helicopter seemed to be moving along the fire edge to the east of DP-162 and not in the direction of the UAS.  Once the UAS was over the meadow and below the treetops (approximately 2 min), I contacted AA on air to ground primary.  I let AA know that we are still conducting UAS operations and the helicopter seemed close to our area of operations and asked if we needed to set down to allow the helicopter to work.   AA reply was that the helicopter \u201cwandered a bit too far\u201d and to standby.  The UASP(t) landed the UAS (approximately another 2 min), I then let AA know we were on the ground and we were told to stay on the ground.   The UAS remained on the ground the remainder of the shift.  \r\nThe image below is of the track log of the UAS during the flight overlaid on the ops map of the fire.  The green icon is where the UAS was launched from.    \r\n\r\n National UAS Operations Specialist:\r\n1. The UASL attended a meeting at the helibase the following day.  Although at the conclusion of the meeting everyone was able to say what they needed and end on a positive note, there were some comments that may need to be discussed further.  \r\n2. Both helicopters were unaware that a UAS was in the air during their missions.  \r\n3.  The UAS was repeatedly called a toy and it was stated that the UAS pilots \u201cdon\u2019t have any skin in the game\u201d and that if we crash a drone we just get another one where as if we crash into a helicopter they would be taking a \u201cdirt nap\u201d.   Although I completely agree with the pilots frustrations and concerns with UAS better communication preseason with the helicopter community as a whole might help with integration.  Use cases and examples of how UAS is utilized usually helps to understand why the demand for UAS is growing so rapidly.  \r\n4. The UASL was asked why we didn't call the helicopter on the victor freq.  The use of hand held VHF radios from the ground has proven to be unreliable for communication.  \r\n5. PMS-515 states For Type 3 and Type 4 UAS Communications are maintained with the UAS crew only on assigned FM frequencies.                           Region 1 UAS Aviation Specialist: \r\n1.\tThe UAS crew followed all their and the Aerial Supervision procedures. But as is not uncommon, things slip through the cracks. When the UAS crew had concerns about the proximity of the helicopter they made a smart and safe decision to descend out of the way and establish communication to check everyone\u2019s situational awareness. This is good decision making on their part. \r\n2.\tCommunication on the air-to-air frequencies is a problem that needs to be solved. A UAS is an aircraft and therefore should have reliable communication on those frequencies. I don\u2019t know how to solve it except to go to radio experts with our issues. A vehicle radio seems impractical, so the solution seems to lie in some sort of booster or antenna. \r\n3.\tSituational awareness enhancement could also be achieved by petitioning the FAA to allow ADS-B output on our UAS. This is again an issue that is probably not easy to accomplish, but worth pursuing. \r\n4.\tManned aircraft pilots having the opinion that UAS has no \u201cskin in the game\u201d in regards to a collision is not unreasonable. To alleviate this, I think the suggestions already discussed would help. To reiterate: More reliable communication and situational awareness may make the manned aircraft pilots and crews feel better about sharing the airspace with UAS. If the manned aircraft pilots believe that they will be able to talk to and see where the UAS is when they need to, their concerns should be diminished. Also, continuing the communication procedures by the UAS pilots as was done in this instance should also be a mitigation for a mishap. \r\n"}
{"Tracking #":"21-0789","Mission Type":"Fire, Infrared Imagery","Text":"On the evening of August 10th, 2021, while flying night operation missions with a CWN UAS, a vendor provided and operated FireEye, on the Monument Fire, the unmanned aerial vehicle experienced a hard landing. This was the initial start of the tour with the plan for a single 2 hour flight for the first night after site selection and setup during daylight hours.  Operation were being conducted between Division U and Division W at 2,700\u2019 MSL with a density altitude at the time of 6,332\u2019.  Take off occurred after a crew briefing, notification to dispatch, helibase, and ASGS verifying all manned aviation flights in the TFR were completed for the day along with the SOP blind radio calls.  After a successful approximate 2 hour flight while returning to the home location, the aircraft transitioned to vertical landing and began descent. The transition overshot the landing area but recovered to directly above the pad by pilot manual input.  Once over the landing pad the aircraft began descending at an increasing rate of speed until rapidly impacting the pad at approximately 2226 hours. The vertical motors appeared operational during descent and although the aircraft appeared stable could not slow the rate of descent. The aircraft fuselage, gimbal, wings, and feet with multiple rotor strikes from the vertical motors were all damaged by the impact with the ground. No personnel were near the aircraft, no other equipment was damaged, and no injuries occurred. Sequence of Events per the Vendor's Mishap Report:\r\nAfter the aircraft overshot the Launch and Recovery Zone (LRZ), it transitioned from forward flight to hover at 200 ft. AGL, 70 ft. above the planned 130 ft. AGL. The overshoot and higher than expected transition altitude were a result of the tailwind. With a tailwind the aircraft final altitude will be higher. The transition process, as expected, flared the aircraft upward by an additional 50 ft. With the aircraft in AUTO mode, the autopilot moved the aircraft in reverse to position over the LRZ. As the aircraft did this, the telemetry logs (tlogs) show that the aircraft autopilot sought to maintain attitude before rapidly descending to land. Once the rapid rate of descent was noted QHOVER was commanded to manually take control of the aircraft for landing. The decent rate was too great to overcome despite the throttle increase command to prevent a hard landing.\r\n\r\nCorrective Actions per the Vendor's Mishap Report:\r\n1) Update crew resource training materials to address the need to ensure checks lists are being followed and to assess unexpected conditions during flight (e.g., no challenge on the aircraft overshot the landing zone at a much higher altitude than expected or whether prolonger operations in reverse made sense vs. QHOVER). \r\n2) The RPIC and RSO were disqualified from piloting duties subject to successful completion of remediation training on the proper operation of aircraft during landing, including when QHOVER is selected during positioning, as well as the identification of standard and non-standard conditions and operations that are communicated \r\namongst crew members to identify potential issues regarding wind direction, velocity, aircraft altitude, and flight characteristics. Pilots can be reinstated once remediation training is successfully completed. \r\nc) Conduct mishap debrief for all vendor pilots. The debrief which included lessons learned \/ flight documentation changes was completed on 26 August 21. "}

With the Aircraft in sight the Pilot again attempted to return the aircraft to \u201cfly mode\u201d. The aircraft was unresponsive to any input from the controller. As the aircraft self landed it was missing the landing pad by approximately 3 ft. This created a situation where the aircraft was going to land partially off the road and the cut bank was a extremely steep drop off for a hundred feet or so. As it touched down it immediately started to rock back to fall off the cut bank, the pilot in anticipation of this happening had moved in closer to the aircraft and was able to place his foot on the aircrafts right skid to prevent it from completely flipping over and dropping off the edge. The aircraft rolled to the left with the skid not being held down by the pilots foot falling off the road. This caused to rotors to impact the ground completely breaking 2 rotor blades and cracking the third.\r\nThe Pilot, VO and Regional UAS Specialist (who was on scene) conducted an AAR. The only potential thing that was not attempted was to restart the controller.

URXX was located in Division Uniform, 1.33 miles to the south, southwest of the K\/U break. Take off and landing location for URXX was in Division Uniform,  on the south side shoulder of Cecilville road.\r\nPrior to URXX launch, the visual observer (V.O.) contacted HLCO, and received permission for URXX to fly in Division Uniform, with altimeter and altitude established. HLCO added, that they would be far  past the area where URXX was operating. Approximately 8-9 minutes into the flight, HLCO contacted URXX and stated they would be flying near DIV U, but would stay out of Div U. HLCO called again, and said they would stay to the north of Cecilville road, UXX acknowledged and advised they would be landing in 5 minutes. Roughly 1-2 minutes later, the pilot for URXX heard a helicopter approaching URXX\u2019s location. Five seconds later, the URXX pilot had a visual on the helicopter. From the URXX pilot perspective, both aircraft were heading directly at each other at indistinguishable altitudes. URXX made a 90 degree turn south to avoid the approaching path of the helicopter. The helicopter flew directly over the landing pad for URXX(located on the south shoulder of Cecilville road). VO contacted HLCO and advised that they just flew over URXX landing location and stated that they were not North of Cecilville road as previously stated. HLCO acknowledged he was close but thought he would be clear of the airspace. VO called HLCO again to let them know how close they actually were. HCLO acknowledged again and stated they would do better next time. URXX pilot landed UAS with no further incident.\r\nURXX pilot pulled the flight log from URXX to get an accurate measurement of distance between the 2 aircraft (300-350 ft).\r\nURXX pilot and VO immediately drove to a cell phone location to inform AOBD and ASGS and discuss further with HLCO of the event. HLCO mentioned they were North of Cecilville RD after passing Cecilville spike, however they slid south to Cecilville road sighting visual concerns due to smoke. HLCO stated this one got away from him and his pilot and they would do better next time.\r\n\r\n After discussion with HLCO, it was determined utilizing specific section numbers on the Incident Operational map where the UAS was specifically operating in Div U, could have been helpful for additional situational awareness.\r\n\r\nHLCO and UAS operators agree that conversations between them need more complete and specific information. Both parties agreed to be more specific moving forward"}
{"Tracking #":"21-0899","Mission Type":"Fire, Infrared Imagery","Text":"After conducting PSD operations on DIV RR, near Grizzly Dip, on the Dixie Fire, the UAS module went into IR operations to look for spots across the line. During one of the IR flights almost immediately after taking off, flying in a NE direction, Visual Observer (VO) noticed the LED light on the rear of the aircraft turn solid red. The aircraft then started flying in the complete opposite direction it was being piloted (SW). Remote Pilot Trainee, was still able to climb and yaw the aircraft however, was unable to pitch forward or backwards to stop the aircraft from flying in the SW direction it was heading. VO called out \"fly away\" at which point pilot trainee immediately hit the return to home button. I noticed that the light on the controller was still green. The aircraft still kept its SW heading. Qualified Remote Pilot took control of the aircraft and after approximately 30 seconds was able to regain control, at which point the LED light on the rear of the aircraft turned solid Green again. The aircraft was piloted back to its \"home location\" and safely landed. Suspected GPS Interference \r\n\r\nOAS, USGS, and BLM SMEs will review the data.\r\n\r\nR5 AMS will follow up on data review for any possible information bulletin needs."}
{"Tracking #":"21-0934","Mission Type":"Fire, Infrared Imagery","Text":"As UASP (T) I began a UAS flight from DP 47 on DIV Zulu of the Monument Fire headed West along indirect fire line.  The mission was spot fire detection using an Infrared Camera.  No spot fires were detected from  IHC\u2019s firing operation.  Upon completion of the mission I returned to DP 47 and proceeded to land.\r\n\r\nUpon landing the aircraft I powered it down, pulling both toggles down and in.  This is one of the options in the manual but I do not recommend it. The aircraft did not completely power off and tipped back, 4 props were damaged.  No personnel were injured.  The corrective action is to stick to powering down the aircraft using only the left toggle, pulling straight down and back.\r\nI believe I chose to power down the aircraft the way I did because of muscle memory (The correct way to power the aircraft on is to pull both toggles back and in.)\r\n I plan on using the left toggle to power off the aircraft in the future."}
{"Tracking #":"21-0965","Mission Type":"Fire, Infrared Imagery","Text":"Scenario: Loss of UAS while conducting thermal IR recon on River Complex, Klamath NF\r\n\r\nPreflight checklist was routine and unremarkable. Mission plan on launch was to monitor UAS aerial ignition groundwork directly adjacent to LZ. This mission objective was met quickly and unremarkably. On scene incident personnel then requested IR recon approx. one mile east (Carter Meadows Summit aka H1, see figure). Slopes around H1 had been experiencing rapid fire growth, and several recon missions had been successfully completed prior to this request. As such, this repeat request was heeded given the proximity of H1, known hazards, and remaining battery reserves.\r\n\r\nThis recon around H1 revealed substantial new growth below and on ridges further east, and an add\u2019l direction was given to scout further eastward to gauge fire extent and holding lines. Pilot in command noted remaining battery life (65.5% average across six) and proceed NE then E, gaining ground rapidly due to strong tailwind. This tailwind was not present in recent prior recon flights around H1.\r\n\r\nApprox 1.5mi east of LZ the video feed became unstable. Pilot briefly halted for recon then began navigating home to the west. Notably, video feed did not stabilize despite closing the distance to the LZ \u2013 intermittent\/broken feed, and frozen screen required VO to disconnect and reconnect tablet cable to GCS. At this point VO noted speed of ~16mph despite full deflection pitch forward. This is a known indicator of severe headwind. GCS remained connected (\u201cgreen\u201d) throughout with PIC in control.\r\n\r\nAt approx. 1mi east of LZ the craft crossed a large valley that rises steeply up to H1. This was very near the location of a known spot from earlier in the day. As the aircraft approached the westward valley slopes rising up to H1, feed was lost followed by loss of link to GCS. Remaining battery was 24% (average across six), distance to LZ was ~4900ft. Connection was not reestablished. After 10 minutes monitoring airspace for autonomous return to home, the aircraft was presumed lost and airspace authority notifications were made. Due to loss of link and remaining battery life, the incident was reported as a UAS flyaway.\r\n\r\nFollowing notifications and airspace re-clearance, the UAS module regrouped and resumed filling incident recon requests using backup aircraft until end of shift. *Be aware of mission creep* The mission plan on launch was expanded with two subsequent in-flight requests. Completing these requests brought UAS endurance factors into play that were potentially manageable, but not considered in advance to identify and mitigate risks before they arose. If multiple destinations had been considered before launch, range and battery management would have been scrutinized. Returning to LZ from this flight with standard 35% battery reserves would have been in question.\r\n\r\n*Gauge winds throughout flight* Wind amplifies fire behavior and diminishes aircraft endurance. Winds at LZ were no factor, but were substantial in adjacent area where the majority of flight took place. Variable winds led to bad aircraft position, and drove convective fire behavior along the path home to LZ.\r\n\r\n*Be aware of rapidly changing environmental factors when performing repeat flights with the same mission profile* Repeated flights of the same mission profiles can cause complacency. Complacency is not limited to times of slow activity. An increase in operational tempo is commonly an indicator of changing conditions but may not be recognized as such because of tunnel vision at crucial time. Tactical pause may be warranted and is ultimately the responsibility of the pilot in command."}

The second time I was able to determine that it was notifying it was losing satellites. I was at 8 satellites and told the Visual Observer that I was returning to home.\r\nOnce within the landing area the aircraft was not responding well to the inputs. I noticed more drift than normal and once the aircraft was under 20ft it would move horizontally, and the motors would rev. I preformed a \"go around\" and attempted a second landing. The same thing happened so we decided to auto-land the aircraft.\r\nIt Started to respond as it was supposed to and climbed to 240ft and started to descend. \r\nAbout 100ft up it was yawing and \"searching\" for a landing area. The aircraft made maneuvers that were not desirable and I tried to cancel the return to launch. Instinctively, I tried to correct the aircraft with small stick inputs. Before the cancellation was made the aircraft flew into a nearby tree. Crash was recorded at 11:03.\r\nThe aircraft seemed to be rolling right as the crash occurred and not climbing or descending.\r\nPG&E was working on a nearby powerline about 50ft to the south near the crash site. \r\nGPS jamming was communicated before the flight but that we would be outside of the jamming area. \r\nUpon further review we could have been within the cone of the jamming site.      During this incident, coordination through the National Airspace Coordinator was a successful corrective action.  Current UAS fleet is dependent on a strong GPS signal for position location and flight safety.  In situations where firefighting UAS aircraft are operating on the fringe of a known VIP TFR restriction (e.g., a Presidential TFR), it is recommended that incident and regional leadership work through the National Airspace Coordinator for deconfliction and clarification.  Additionally, it may be advisable to increase the safety distance from the pre-identified area and consider grounding aircraft until cleared by the National Airspace Coordinator and Dispatch Center.

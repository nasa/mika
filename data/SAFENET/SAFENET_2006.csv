We were given a ticket number. Immediately after I called our forest radio tech. and told him what was going on. The radio tech. said he knew what the problem was and that he would schedule a time soon to come fix the problem. Within a few days we received and automated message saying that the ticket had been closed. The radios were still not operational so we called EUSC to reopen the ticket. EUSC said that the ticket was not closed and that the message we received did not mean that the ticket was closed.

On 11/14/2006 I submitted another ticket with EUSC over the phone in regards to one of our forest radio repeaters not working. The repeater is called Mitchell Peak repeater. Again within a few days I received an automated message saying that this ticket had been closed. Under the assumption EUSC told me from my last ticket I assumed that the radio tech. had been notified and I did not call to question why the ticket had been closed. A week or so went by without anyone contacting us about fixing the repeater. I called EUSC to check on the status of the ticket. EUSC told me no action had been taken. I asked them to elevate the ticket to the next level so that it would be taken care of in a timely manner. I was told that it was elevated.

ON 12/08/2006 we received a call from our dispatch concerning radio problems and some confusion with tickets from EUSC. Some confusion with the number of tickets and who placed them was resolved between us. No one at dispatch or the radio shop had received the ticket stating that Mitchell Peak repeater was not working. I gave the radio tech. the ticket number and he looked it up. He said the ticket had been closed, but not by him. He said that this was one of the problems he had been experiencing with EUSC due to an automated process that apparently closes the ticket before it is sent to him.

For the past few months our forest radio system has not been and is still not completely operational to communicate with the dispatch office. Our only way of tracking district personnel in the field is through the radio at the district office. During this time personnel from the district continue to work in the field on a daily basis. This includes prescribed fire activities, trail crew work, range management, biological assessments, recreation site maintenance, thinning operations, and fire prevention. The Clifton RD is fairly remote with areas of highway that may not have people driving through for hours, with trails and other areas which may not see another person for days or even weeks. Mitchell Peak repeater provides radio coverage for a large section of the district with no other way of communication. This is a safety issue to personnel in the field with no other way of communication if an emergency situation should occur.","Having to report problems to EUSC adds extra time and creates a communication gap between the person having the problem and the people who can fix the problem. We should be able to directly contact the radio tech ourselves to eliminate an error chain that comes with involving someone (EUSC) not directly involved with solving the problem. If EUSC is a way of tracking issues then it is not working if tickets are being closed for unexplained reasons. I have been told in the past that we are not allowed to call the radio tech directly, that we have to let the EUSC system work. From the example above the system does not work properly. The EUSC has worked some of the time in the past but not always. I have always had to call the radio tech after submitting a ticket to get a timely resolution. By people calling the radio techs directly we have been making a failed system work. I see no benefit from a safety standpoint by having EUSC complicate the process that only delays action between the radio tech and the field. LCES is the basis in all that we do whether it is fire related or not. Communication failures are the number one contributor in all situations gone bad. This miscommunication between EUSC and the radio techs is a failure that could have lead to a negative outcome had an incident occurred.","12/11/2006 00:00"

No fatalities or serious injuries occurred.

A heavy load was being towed from Moab to Ephraim when the accident occurred.

Upon receiving the load (approx. 11500lbs (trailer included)) in Moab on Monday morning, there was a last minute change of the truck to be used to haul the load. Connections from the trailer to the truck were checked and thought to be functioning properly.

During the first hour and a half there were no issues or warnings that there might be a problem. 45 minutes into the trip a stop was made to ensure the load was riding properly.

At approximately 11:50 a down grade was started and an irregular section of the road surface was encountered.

Traveling at approximately 65 mph the truck and trailer drove over a section of pavement that was sunken and uneven. The swale in the road surface caused the trailer to start a wobble back and forth that became uncontrollable. A controlled slow down was attempted but a jack knife occurred causing both truck and trailer to slide and eventually roll over.

One message to get out is to ensure that the safety features are working properly. The trailer lights and attachments were tested and were thought to be functioning properly. Due to the inability of the driver to slow down and correct the fishtailing, it is thought that the trailer brakes were not functioning properly if at all when the accident occurred. Make no assumptions even if the trailer set up has been used on previous and recent trips. The driver/operator carries most of the responsibility.

Communication is also an issue here. It has come to light that previous users of the truck and trailer had encountered problems with the trailer braking system but that information did not get forwarded to the driver/operator that day.

Training in the transportation of towed loads to personnel should be considered wherever possible. Operator of vehicle was accustomed to driving heavy vehicles but not towing heavy loads.","Hauler/operator to make sure safety features are working (i.e. Trailer brakes).

Near-miss Entrapment/Burn-Over Report

9/13/06

I was requested as a Helicopter Coordinator (O-157) for the Heaven’s Gate Complex Fire outside of Riggins, ID on 9/5/06. On 9/6/06 I arrived at the fire, checked in at the ICP located at the old CCC Camp 106 location in Riggins, ID. I then proceeded to the HLB located at the Slate Creek airstrip approximately 30 driving miles north of the ICP. Over the next week I performed my duties as Helicopter Coordinator and flew a considerable number of hours over the fire and became very familiar with the topography, fire extension as well as observed fire behavior. A typical day’s work would consist of varied missions including providing aerial supervision for R/W A/C, tasking R/W A/C in direct support of line personnel, de-conflicting flight routes, checking fire spread, monitoring other fires in the complex as well as providing eyes-in-the-sky for ground personnel. During the course of those missions I would be in radio communications w/Line Ops, Div. Supv. as well as various other line personnel and the helibase. Each morning immediately following the 0600 Operational Period briefing I would meet with the Operations Section Chief (usually “Planning Ops”) and receive my priorities for the day. On 9/12/06 my priorities were #1 - Support burn-out in Div. P starting around 1000, # 2 - Monitor fire spread in Div. P & N for fire proximity to and spotting across the 394 Road, # 3 - Monitor for spotting on the South side of the Salmon River onto the Payette NF. The 9/12/06 0600 Operational Period Briefing, Tactical Objectives for the day were to complete the construction of hand line down Van Ridge in Div. P and commence burning operations. It should be noted that the previous day’s (9/11/06) 0600 Operational Period Briefing/Tactical Objectives were to abandon the cat line/hand line on Kelly Peak ridge and shift the majority of the resources over to constructing hand line from DP 19 down the Van Ridge to the Salmon River due to the fact that the fire had crossed the trigger point in Smith Creek and that there was not adequate time to initiate Phase one of a three phase burn out operation along the 394 road and the Kelly Peak ridgeline. There was no mention of any crews or resources being deployed on the Kelly Peak ridge cat line area in the 9/12/06 0600 Operational Period Briefing nor in my conversation w/Line Ops regarding aviation priorities for the day.

On 9/12/06 I was in the process flying the cat line on the Kelly Peak ridgeline checking for fire extension across the cat line. The flying weather that day had been typically marginal with poor visibility due to the inversion trapping the smoke from the fire in the Salmon River Canyon up to and over the 394 road along the rim. It was not until later in the day, sometime in mid afternoon that I was first able to fly over the Kelly Peak cat line on the ridge. The fire had been very active the previous three days gradually working its way west and north up to the rim. While I was flying the cat line from Coffee Can Saddle down the ridge toward the Salmon River (S/W), I observed that the fire had crossed the cat line in several places along the knob immediately to the S/W of Coffee Can Saddle. I immediately called the Div. P Supv. on the radio and informed him. He acknowledged my transmission. I continued to fly on down the line and started to see hose strung out along the cat line. It was difficult to pick up the cat line from the air due to poor visibility from the smoke as well as heavier fuels canopy. The fire was well established and actively burning below the cat line in Robbins Creek, Smith Creek, the upper portions of the three forks of Gasper Creek, above the Sheep Cabin and had extended to the west as far as the eastern ridgeline of Flock Creek. As I proceeded down the cat line I noticed that in several places the fire had actually burned through the hose as it crossed the cat line. I made a mental note to myself that they must have pulled off the line quickly to have abandoned so much hose. On several occasions we lost sight of the cat line and had to swing around to pick it up. It was on one of the attempts to relocate the cat line that I noticed 2 fuel cans along the cat line. I made another mental note and mentioned to the pilot that it would be interesting to be around when the fuel cans “went off.” As we continued down the line and got into the more heavily timbered section of line, I noticed that some hose had been collected and bunched along side of the cat line. I noted that it appeared that they were in the process of collecting and “yarding up” the hose when they decided to abandon the line. Almost immediately I spotted something moving on the cat line under the canopy. We immediately circled around and discovered a lone firefighter, who appeared to be in the process of pulling hose and bunching it up. I immediately called the Div. P Supv. on the radio & asked if he was aware that he still had firefighters on the cat line. He stated that he was not and I recommended that he pull them off the line immediately. He stated he would take care of it. I notified him that we would remain on station until the firefighter was clear of the area. We continued to orbit around the firefighter trying not to loose sight of him in the smoke and down through the canopy. In the process of swinging around to try to keep an eye on the firefighter we noticed a lone red pick up truck parked on a jeep road on the back side (N/W - away from the fire) of the knob that had the cat line on it. The truck was parked on the Jeep Road further down the ridge toward the Salmon River and a little to the N of the intersection of the cat line and the Jeep road. The truck was approximately 1/4 of a mile away from the firefighter. When the firefighter continued to work on dragging hose I attempted to call him on the radio on the Div. P Tac 2 net. I made several calls in the blind “Firefighter collecting hose on the cat line in Div. P please identify.” After several unsuccessful attempts to contact the firefighter on Tac 2, I received a call 'firefighter, HLCO on A/G.' It was the firefighter and he asked me if the fire had crossed the line above him and I stated yes and I asked if he had gotten the word to depart the area. He stated that he had. I then asked him if that was his red pick up truck and he stated that it was. We continued to orbit around him and noticed that he went back to pulling hose. I was incredulous. I immediately contacted him and stated “firefighter, HLCO, A/G, loose the hose.' The firefighter stood up and proceeded to depart the area at a more than rapid walk and headed down the hill towards his pick up truck. He got in the truck and commenced rapidly driving out the jeep road to the N/E. We followed the truck from the air until it was clear of the area. I then contacted the Div. P Supv. and notified him that the firefighter was in the clear. I then asked the Div. P Supv. if he had any more people out on the line. He replied that he was 'not sure' or something to that effect. I told him that I was going to continue to fly the line and check. We proceeded to fly the line several times and did not see any additional individuals or vehicles. I flew the line several times and then called the Div. P Supv. I notified him that we had flown the line several times and had not seen anybody on the ground. I then asked if he could confirm that there were no additional people out on the line. He again stated that he was not sure or something to that effect. I then asked him if he felt that a roll call would be necessary. He stated that he would get back to me. We remained in the area and within a few minutes he called me and stated that a roll call would not be necessary. We departed the area.

At the time all this was happening the fire was very active, had a moderate size column built and were experiencing 1/4 mile spotting. The fire had crossed the cat line in several places to the N & E of SOF firefighter’s location. It appeared that the leading edge of the fire at SOF firefighter’s location was considerably less than 1/4 mile. We noticed several smokes between the cat line and the jeep road. It should be noted that at the 9/12/06 0600 briefing the LTAN gave a very detailed FB briefing (see 9/12/06 FBAN Forecast # 19) for the day with the potential for high rates of spread (including editorial comments that predicted rates of spread would exceed human capacity to outrun the fire) as well as long range spotting.

It is worth noting that as a journeyman HLCO I rarely observed lone firefighters. I routinely see lookouts posted on vantage points, most often in pairs a safe distance from the fire. In other words it is unusual to see firefighter working all by themselves in such close proximity to an active flame front. In this instance the firefighter was alone, appeared to be working independently and from my observations and based upon my brief conversations with the firefighter apparently oblivious of his proximity to the leading edge of the fire and that the fire had crossed the cat line and was threatening the Jeep road escape route as well as. Perhaps the most distressing item to note was that the firefighter was a Safety Officer. From my vantage point I felt that the fire’s proximity to SOF firefighter posed a direct and immediate threat to SOF firefighter. I site the South Canyon report as testimony that individuals typically do not recognize that they are in danger until it is too late.

The following is a list of the LCES and 10 & 18 that I observed from the air that appeared to be violated:

LCES:

L - I (HLCO) did not observe nor was aware of any lookouts posted in the area.

C - I (HLCO) Do not know if the FF was in contact with any lookouts

E - The only vehicular escape routes I observed were the cat line on the ridge and the Jeep road to the W. As noted the cat line escape route had been compromised by the fire spread.

S - It should be noted that in the course of flying the cat line over the past several days I observed only one area along the cat line that looked like it might be a safety zone. There were no SZ Icons indicated on any of the IAP maps or pilot maps that I received. Given the predicted FL from the FBAN Forecast # 19 for 9/12/06 predicting FL of between 4-10', the IRPG specifies a minimum of 40' (1/10th acre) which I feel I would have noticed from the air.

This aircraft had made several drops along a different part of the fire. The aircraft was re-directed to another part of the fire to pretreat part of the line next to a tree that was torching. Ground personnel directing the aircraft indicated they were next to an engine. As the aircraft approached the drop area, it was diverted to the torching tree. The aircraft opened all doors and hit the tree dead on. The aircraft did not see the engine that was in the area. The engine roof and light bar was damaged and an engine crewperson that was standing outside the engine at the time of the drop suffered minor injuries (the person was in the direct vicinity of where the water was applied). The Line Officer from the State (Oregon Department of Forestry - Northeast Oregon District), along with the Line Officer from the supporting agency involved, were immediately notified and collectively they implemented a fact-finding investigation into the incident.

Environmental conditions on the incident included smoke, partial crown closure in a multi-story stand, and torching trees. The terrain was steep and there were strong, erratic winds.

The engine was the same color as the ground, which may have contributed to the Helitanker not seeing the engine when the drop was made. Misunderstanding existed between ground personnel directing aircraft and pilot. Also, engine personnel had not been monitoring the air-to-ground frequency, but had been told to vacate the area.","1) The air-to-ground radio frequency should be monitored at all times by all resources near a drop zone.

2) Communication should be clear between pilot, person directing aircraft, and any personnel in area of drop zone. Ensure directions have been understood.

3) Ensure pilot has visual of drop zone and any resources in the area. Communicate objective of run clearly, whether a dry run or a drop.

4) Ensure all ground crews understand the dynamics of working with Helitankers. They should be treated the same as an air tanker rather than a bucket ship. 'Clear' of drop zone with regards to Helitanker must be a minimum of 150 feet away or three times the tree length (whichever is farther). This must be understood by all in vicinity of drop zone.    The following information has been shared with local personnel that supervise fire crews:

1) The air-to-ground radio frequency should be monitored at all times by fireline resources.

2) Communication should be clear between the pilot, person directing aircraft, and any personnel in the area of aircraft use.

3) Heavy helicopters should conduct dry runs, communicate such, and make sure communication is understood.

4) Review airtanker safety guidelines and treat helitankers the same as airtankers. Related safety training materials will be distributed among crews and reiterated at safety trainings. This includes safety information prepared by a helicopter manager, and the following web links:

Eight smokejumpers, two helitack crewmembers, and six contract engine crewmembers became cutoff from their safety zone when their escape route was cut off by a running crown fire. These individuals retreated to a drop point area approximately 1 acre in size and requested an aerial evacuation by helicopter. This area was not considered a safety zone due to the size and fire behavior present. The request was made for an emergency evac and a helicopter was ordered from helibase. I was the helicopter manager, an Exc. Use HELM (the helitack on the spot were his crew members) assisted me and there was the pilot. It was determined that it would take 2 flights to shuttle everyone out. The helicopter was able to land at the drop point. With the time critical situation, myself and the pilot made the decision to deviate from policy (SAFECOM filed) and not brief, manifest, or provide a flight helmet for the passengers. Essentially, I opened the door and said we could take 8, and to get on. We took off for the drop off area. When we returned for the last group, the gear in the center of the spot, some boxes and a pile of pulaskis was on fire from the radiant heat. We were able to land, load the last group and take off. There were 100+ foot flame lengths coming off the canopy coming from two different angles at the spot. This was a critical near miss and needs to be brought to attention for review. The helicopter sustained a small burn hole on the seat during the evacuation. Equipment was lost; people came close to being injured or worse. A summary of the event is being distributed with inaccuracies that is a concern to me.","So many. The supposed drop point is being called a safety zone by the jumpers involved and the situation is being downplayed. The one acre spot was not, nor was it ever a safety zone.

He immediately realized that the contents of the bottle was not grape flavored Gatorade because it had a gasoline taste.

He spat the mixture out but did ingest what was estimated by him to have been about a teaspoon full. Inspection of the cooler yielded another bottle with the same contents, which is surmised to have been two-cycle mix. The person who drank the mixture reports no ill effects as of this date. He also reported that he did not notice that the seal on the bottle had been broken.

Two-cycle mix is commonly used in fire suppression activities in chainsaws and pumps. It is unknown why two-cycle mix was put into Gatorade bottles but probably was a situation in which authorized containers were not available. More than likely the contaminated bottles found their way into the cooler inadvertently when someone noticed them in a pile of gear and added them to the cooler, also not noticing the broken seal.

A physician was consulted and it is his opinion that no serious health threat would result from ingesting small amounts of gas/oil mixture as long as it did not enter the airway.","Utilizing only authorized labeled containers would eliminate this problem.

Ensuring that seals on any beverage had not been broken or tampered with should be a common practice.    The situation was addressed by informing everyone at the incident at the daily safety briefings and inspecting coolers in the camp for other bottles with broken seals.","09/04/2006 00:00"

At approx. 2:30 in the afternoon, we were requested to help out in a troubled area in div W.About 15 minutes later, we met with our TFL to receive a briefing. After receiving our instructions, we proceeded to the troubled area. As we proceeded up the narrow rd, we started to recognize several watch out situations . I stopped and contacted our TFL about our concerns.I asked him several question about the safety regarding our assignment.He them became quite irritable ,and then he told us that unless we took the assignment,he would replace us with someone that could, and would have us demobed from the incident. After a long discussion with the TFL, we then learned that on that same day, another Type 6 engine had refused the same assignment because of safety concerns.After our discussion , the TFL helped us to resolve some of our safety concerns, and we proceeded to our assignment. As we arrived, we were contacted by TFL. He then requested us to keep an eye on 2-20 person crews from Alaska. We then made contact with one of the crew bosses. He informed us that he had no idea what their assignment was. We also discovered that they only had one radio per crew. We then tried to reach TFL, but were unable to contact him. I then contacted DIV sup, and informed him on what was going on. He then told us to do what we could, as long as it was safe, while he contacted our TFL. As we went to work working the fire edge,we realized that their were many dangerous snags in our working area. We then requested a team of fallers. Several minutes later, they showed up.After identifieng the tree hazards, they proceeded to fall the snags.After the tree hit the ground, it immediatly started to torch.

Both the Vale District and Burns Interagency Fire Zones had fires in close proximity to each other. Fires on both districts required tactical repeaters to communicate throughout each fire. Because the receive frequencies are the same Burns fire traffic walked on Vale fire traffic and vice versa. This happened in a very critical time when both districts had structures threatened and were mobilizing several resources (both air and ground), not to mention a transition to a Type 1 Incident Management Team on the Burns district. The Star Mountain Incident on the Vale district was forced to disengage and switch to a different frequency with no repeater capabilities at the time. This had to happen mid-shift and was difficult to get to every resource, due to the size of the fire (43,500 acres). This took almost 40 minutes to complete. This additional tac frequency is also a shared frequency, for which the Burns district was using as an air to ground over one of the many complexes they had at the time. This is an issue especially on the south end of the Vale and Burns District and has been for years. It is an issue that both districts have tried to deal with each year asking for our own tactical frequencies, and so far we have been unsuccessful.","This is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. We often have multiple fires in close proximity to each other. Both the Vale and Burns Districts should be given different tac frequencies, and this should be done as soon as possible to eliminate any further communication issues both districts have.","09/01/2006 00:00"

The report came in as small, billowy, white column less than quarter acre in size. Normal dispatch procedure and protocols were immediately implemented for planned suppression of the new IA fire (Dispatch 259). 5 Minutes later (1725), a cross shot from another lookout was issued for a more accurate location. This fire plotted out on USFS protection but was well within a mile of State Protection. Based on our current fire danger, we launched a Type I Helicopter that was staged nearby (@ 1725). At this point in time through the next 44 minutes is where numerous concerns for potential issues began. The Type I Helicopter NEVER made contact with dispatch to let us know he was flight following locally with a ground unit. Dispatch had no updated smoke characteristics and/or 'no change' updates from the lookout and/or any units. A concern for potential issues arose immediately when over the radio a transition came in stating the fire was '5 to 15 acres'. Not knowing if any unit was on scene yet (aircraft and/or ground unit) and still wondering what was up with the Type I helicopter, Zone immediately dispatched additional resources which included aircraft, crews, and equipment. This '5 to 15 acre' transmission over the radio also caused concern with other fire managers related to a fire less than a quarter acre to a rapid 5 to 15 acres. Finally, a cell phone transaction with the responding Duty Officer was initiated to find out what was going on with this particular dispatch as far as fire behavior and information on the Type I Helicopter. It was at this time (30+ minutes into this), is when Zone found out the Helicopter was flight following with the ground and it was from the Type I Helicopter that the '5 to 15 acres' report came from. It was @ 1833 when the Dispatch Floor finally received a report and/or update from a lookout, duty officer, and/or any responding unit via radio and it was from a unit that arrived on scene. The on scene report was one tenth acre, heavy stuff on ground and minutes later in duff, smoldering with open flames, spread factor low, etc... Dispatch proceeded to cancel numerous units responding and continued closest units for suppression of this incident.","The issues with the Type I Helicopter would have been prevented with simply letting dispatch know when in the air and then letting dispatch know it was switching over to air-ground with a what unit. Also, getting confirmation from the ground unit that he/she is switching over too. The issues with the 'fire updates' could have been prevented with the proper 10 minute update/check-in on smoke characteristics from the lookout and/or any reports relayed to the ground unit back to dispatch via radio. 1 +/- an hour before a radio update is way too long. This is very important due to jurisdictional concerns/issues that arose when the '5 to 15 acres' came through a radio transmission. More aircraft was and was about to be involved and more ground units was and was about to be involved which presents the potential for more issues/concerns.    A discussion with the Type I Helicopter occurred once they were back on the ground their staging area and also with the 'host' Duty Officer about proper flight following procedures. The issue on the fire updates was presented to the Acting Fire Staff for our area. Proper communication and additional 'timely' communication would and hopefully will prevent these issues in the future.","08/24/2006 00:00"

These crews were filling outstanding crew orders for the Potato Fire. After arrival, there were delays in Boise due to 1) feeding the crews hot meals at a local restaurant that could only accommodate 2 crews at a time and 2) obtaining headlamps from the Cache, 25% of which were defective out of the box. The crews, each in their own rental school bus, did not begin driving toward the incident from Boise until approximately 1900. The route of travel selected from Boise to the incident was via Shoshone and Sun Valley, which is the 'long way' to get to the fire (which is between Stanley and Challis). Although the route is longer than going either through Idaho City or Garden Valley, the roads are better, i.e., less winding and narrow. The crews did not arrive at the Potato ICP/Base Camp until 0200 on 08/17, 7 hours after leaving Boise.

From a risk management standpoint, it was a poor decision to start these crews down the road at 1900. Whoever made this decision should know that school buses top out at around 55 mph on the best freeway, and travel much more slowly on steep grades and narrow, winding roads. It should have been possible to project the crews' arrival time at ICP and this projection should have raised some cautionary flags. In addition, it should have been known that most of this travel would have had to occur in the dark, on roads where deer and other wildlife are plentiful. Steep dropoffs are common along the route of travel from Sun Valley to ICP, and much of this route is also right next to a river. Further, crews arriving at 0200 after such a long travel day could not be used on the fireline today due to their previous shift length, if the 2:1 work/rest ratio was to be followed. In other words, there was really no hurry to get them here since they couldn't be used right away.","Personnel in charge at the Boise Mobilization Center at NIFC need to conduct risk assessments for all mobilizations and demobilizations. These assessments should include projection of estimated travel and arrival times; shift lengths for the resources that are traveling also need to be considered. Providing the crews with sack lunches instead of a local hot meal would have gotten them on the road sooner, but at best they would have arrived at ICP at 2400 instead of 0200.

The issue of such a high number of defective headlamps issued from the Great Basin Cache also needs to be investigated.

The Great Basin Mobilization Guide includes guidance on 'night mobilizations'. The section on 'night mobilization', 13.4.1, reads as follows:

In general, night mobilization (mobilization between the hours of 2200 and 0500) for other than initial attack incidents or first reinforcements is to be avoided other than with commercial carriers (for example, scheduled airlines, National contract aircraft, bus carriers, etc.). If incident objectives necessitate 'night mobilization', then mode of travel and travel times will be negotiated with the ordering office to ensure personnel safety and rest requirements are met.'

In this case, although commercial carriers were used, personnel safety and rest requirements were not met. To my knowledge, there was no negotiation with the ordering office -- the crews were just shipped out. In the future, alternatives for bedding down crews in similar situations, either in Boise or at some other location (Lucky Peak?), need to be explored instead of subjecting crews to 7-hour bus rides at night. As difficult as overnighting crews might be for the Mob. Center, it would be far preferable to having a bus with a crew in it end up at the bottom of a cliff or in a river. Our incident objectives did not necessitate this night mobilization.....in fact, our number 1 objective of providing for firefighter safety was jeopardized by it.    Filed SAFENET, discussed mobilization/demobilization issues with IMT.","08/17/2006 00:00"

The route in and out of the fire utilized an old logging road that was closed down using large water bars and berms. After shuttling supplies for 2 days, it was determined that the berms were probably too rough to cross especially with the ATV loaded down. I spoke with the IC about the ATV operations and about a near miss that already happened when a firefighter rolled the ATV on its side going over one of the berms. It was determined that the risk was becoming too high to continue shuttling supplies and that this would be the last shuttle of supplies back to staging area. I was wearing all required PPE including my line gear and the supplies consisted of 2 cases of MREs, 7 empty bladder bags, and small bag of trash. While enroute back to the staging area, I started up one of the berms when my weight shifted on the ATV causing it to roll over to the left and caught my left lower leg under the ATV. This resulting in a laceration below my knee.","I feel that better communication and establishing a better plan for mitigating safety issues would prevent this problem in the future. There were 4 different individuals that operated the ATV in the 2 day period, my-self, the IC, and 2 different firefighters. We all seemed to have concerns with the route in and out but never really came up with a plan to mitigate the actions. In an After Action Review with one of the other ATV operators, it was determined that we had the same ideas for mitigation of safety issues but we never came out with them to formulate a plan. Right before making this last run, I did talk with the IC and we did talk about the near miss and determined that we would shuttle the supplies out and cease ATV operations. I feel that if we had discussed the near miss between ATV operators all the safety concerns would have come out and a plan would have been established to mitigate the risk.    We tried to resolve this issue by talking about the incident with local overhead describing what happened and the steps leading up to the incident.

They are susceptible to blowouts, flats and are too weak and narrow to protect the rim from damage.

In the last 3 years I have had more than a half dozen flats/blowouts involving General tires. Two weeks ago I had two blowouts in two days while responding to fires. The tires had less than 10,000 miles on them. Last year we had an engine go through 6 tires in less than one month.

I have talked with a number of other engine crews, bosses, and managers and this is a common problem.

The tires will perform fine on the road but will not stand up to off-road (even off-pavement) use.

We are sending our people and equipment into potentially risky situations on tires that are likely to fail.","Many crews have already addressed the problem and this is the fix that is working.

Pull the General Tires (225 70R19.5 load range F) from service and replace them with slightly larger tires with a higher load rating (245 70R19.5 load range G) The most common tire for the corrective action is the Goodyear G124 available GSA. (Some crews have used 265 70R19.5 but you have to be careful with clearance.)

We did this on an engine the same model as the one that lost 6 tires and it spend an entire season in the same area without a problem.

As a benefit of taking this action the engines also have better ground clearance, are more stable, and have more traction.    I resolved the problem on our engine by taking the corrective action listed above. This is a common problem that should be known and addressed. Hopefully through the SAFENET process this will become known to people and get addressed.

One crew member was injured two times by fracturing a finger and then two days later the Camp Crew Boss drove over his foot with a pick-up truck he was using from ground support.","I asked to drive a few times throughout the day and he would respond no. I confronted him at a rest area to slow down his speed and that he was swerving off to the side of the road. This safety issue could have been prevented by sharing the driving responsibilities.

I talked to the Camp Crew Boss a few times in regards to work/rest ratio and he told me I was the trainee and that I needed to follow his way of doing things.","09/26/2006 00:00"

The first involves communications. The second pertains to individual qualifications and the third has to do with Personal Protective Equipment.

Our crew arrived on the Elm Road Fire around 0930 the morning of 8/7/06. The fire was roughly 120 acres with a dozer/disc line around the entire fire. The fire was burning in fuel model 2, primarily grass with a sage component. Our crew’s instructions were to secure the line and mop-up 50 feet interior. Throughout the morning the crew remained busy chasing slop-overs due to material left inside the dozer line. At roughly 1400 a slop-over on the NE side of the fire began to increase in size and by the time our first squad arrived the slop-over was already at 2-3 acres. The Incident Commander had already ordered a SEAT to reinforce the dozer line prior to the final slop-over. The CRWB(t) utilized the SEAT with drops at the head of the fire while the remainder of the crew anchored in to the old dozer line to begin direct line construction. Throughout the remainder of the day and as the fire continued to increase in size it was becoming more and more evident that the Incident Commander was clearly beyond his span of control. There was no implementation of ICS. The IC was running Operations, both ground and air, as well as Logistics. At some point Division Alpha was established, but this was not relayed to our crew.

The issue in regards to communication has to do with the lack of radio frequencies. All communications were being relayed through the local Red Net tac channel. As air resources arrived on scene they too were using Red Net. This created quite a lot of traffic for one channel. During the morning briefing an air-to-ground frequency and channel, as well as a command frequency and channel, were not established.

The second issue has to do with qualifications. It was brought to my attention after the second day shift that the Incident Commander was not qualified at the ICT3 level. He was still a trainee and his trainer was not on scene. I addressed this issue with the IC and he mentioned to me that his task book was complete and that his trainer was comfortable with him acting as fully qualified on this incident. I mentioned to the IC that our agency policy requires the trainer to be on scene throughout the duration of the incident.

The last issue involves the use of Personal Protective Equipment. During the second shift CRWB(t) observed a Strike Team Leader not wearing a fire shelter. The STEN was attached to a strike team of county engines. The crew was involved in mop-up operations and was standing well in the black when the STEN was observed without the shelter. An engine captain with the BLM addressed this issue with the STEN directly. It was unknown if the STEN retrieved his shelter after the engine captain addressed him.","During a debriefing it was suggested that the local district create a frequency list for their own personnel as well as incoming personnel for future fires. Included in that list should be at the minimum, an air-to-ground frequency, a command frequency, and at least 1 tac frequency.

For the future the qualified trainer should be on scene with the trainee. Understanding how different agencies work is important. We assume that everyone is following the same set of rules, but that was not the case with this incident. During the main run of this fire the IC trainee could have definitely used the trainer for support and direction.

In regards to the shelter issue, personnel who are not involved in wildland fire operations on a regular basis need to be reminded that PPE includes their fire shelter. It will be worn at all times while the individual is on the fireline.    It is unknown if the problems were completely resolved, but they were definitely addressed verbally.","08/14/2006 00:00"

Firing had been discontinued 1 hour prior at 1400 hours. At 1505 I called DIV V and DIV Z on the command channel and asked to meet face to face. At 1515 hours while enroute to DIV V, the Kingsley ATGS contacted Hunter Div V and informed him that the Kingsley Fire Team was now in command of DIV V, that he had a Lead plane and Air Tankers on order and would begin dropping them within minutes. The AGTS never attempted to communicate with Operations. Operations contacted ATGS and told him to disengage; Kinglsey ATGS stated he was given direct orders by Kinglsely Operations to implement the retardant plan. Hunter Operations advised ATGS that he had not been given that direction by the Hunter IC and that he should disengage until the Kingsley and Hunter I/C's and Operations met to discuss a SAFE transition. Hunter Operations assembled all affected DIVs, all line personnel were pulled back to a safe area. The face-to-face meeting of all involved parties never occurred. At 1530 hours with Lead orbiting the smoke became too thick to fly.

At the time of this incident there was no revised delegation of authority, each fire had different commander's intent. The Hunter fire was well within the delegation of authority. Upon further investigation, this plan was developed in the morning without communication to the Hunter Fire, even after the morning coordination call with Kingsley Operations.

Numerous 10 and 18 were violated in this incident, jeopardizing the safety of air and ground resources.","Line officer should express CLEAR 'commander's intent to IMTs. If that intent changes 10 days into the incident, that should be communicated well.    The AGTS was briefed in the AM by Hunter Operations by cell phone on the daily strategy and tactics and understood what we were doing with aircraft. This still did not prevent him from implementing a change against the commander's intent of the Hunter Fire.

In the adjoining division we had completed over 2 miles of burning the night before and were holding the line until the resources used the previous night were able to come back on the clock. We had put some fire in the interior to even up the line and to let the fire back down off the ridges reducing the risk of fire getting into the crowns. At 1430 interior firing was completed on 'Dicks Butte'. The plan was to move to the East and put more fire along Skidmore Ridge. At 1515 I received a call on Air/Ground from Air Attack, he said 'by order of the Forest Supervisor and the Regional Director you are to cease firing operations and that we were going to go direct attack'. I called air attack back and told him that I understood his message, but that I was not going to go direct attack, his work with air tankers would not be supported by me. We had worked for 5 days to complete the prep work on the road and tying into the line put in by the CA. Team #4 crews, at Spanish Ridge. This was the plan that we started 5 days earlier. We had tried to go direct several times in these 5 days and were unsuccessful due to: 1) lack of resources; and 2) the fact that the smoke would lay down in the area at approximately 1000 everyday, preventing all aircraft from entering the area except for the cobra with infra red capabilities. Additional reasons I did not go direct were: 1) NO LOOKOUTS with the smoke inversion, aircraft could not see in the area; 2) NO ESCAPE ROUTES steep and rough terrain with heavy dead and down in old growth timber, 2 track roads with trees falling into the road; and 3) NO SAFETY ZONES with steep and rough terrain with continuous fuels. On 8/5 after the order to stop firing, NO aircraft came into the area. All resources were pulled off the line to standby. We all understand the risks involved when there is a transition of command on any incident. To have one occur in the middle of the burning period and to be announced by the air attack is something I thought I would never see due to these risks. All actions taken by our team was in accordance with the WFSA and the Agency Representative was aware of what we were doing.","In the future there should be only ONE team to manage an incident. One plan should be formulated and carried out and everyone should be on the same page to prevent confusion. If a team is to transition with another team then it should be done by having a meeting (face to face) and decide when and where this would occur and announce it with plenty of time in advance to prevent uncertainty.    I gave all the information to the incoming overhead of what I had completed. At this point it was out of my hands and since I did not believe we should go direct I told the resources to be careful and that they were planning on going direct, and I moved to another Division.","08/14/2006 00:00"

During the Canyon fire (7/27/2006) I was the IC and had trouble communicating to our dispatch on our “Command Frequency” McClure because it was used by Tripod as their Command Frequency as well. At the AAR it was mentioned that this was going to be resolved with the use of a repeater assigned to the Tripod fire. On the 27th I also noticed that our initial attack tactical channel was used by Tripod as one of their Tactical channels. The problems with communications did not change on the 29th and 30th. After taking a day off and coming back to work on 8/1/06 I noticed that not only was the Tripod fire using our Command Channel McClure Ch 1, FS Tactical Ch 2, it was also using our back up tactical channel, “project”, Ch 3 as one of their tactical Channels. The only Initial attack frequency not use by Tripod currently is our Air to Ground channel.

While I understand the need for communications on the Tripod Fire I believe it is unnecessary to use 3 of our 4 Initial Attack Frequencies for a project fire.

There were helicopters available (agency and medical) and air attack was giving direct orders to dispatch only to receive rude, negative attitude from a male and female dispatcher. This attitude and resistance to do their job properly could have easily cost someone their life. Like I said this is not the first time one of these dispatch centers have made the calls from their desk and not followed the direct orders of the overhead who they are supposed to be supporting. They need to be reminded that they are there for the firefighters, not the other way around.

The Northern Utah Interagency Fire Center (NUIFC) dispatched Air Attack to assess multiple fire starts in northern Utah. Upon arrival, Air Attack reported several fires, including the Hansel 2 and Deacon fires on private/state jurisdiction. The Air Attack experienced difficulties contacting ground resources from of Box Elder County due to the inability of ground resources to switch to (or program) a common air-to-ground and tactical frequency. Adding to the confusion, NUIFC was never notified which resources were responding to the multiple incidents. When NUIFC contacted Box Elder County, they were too busy to give NUIFC information regarding responding resources or assigned frequencies. Due to the inability to coordinate frequencies with responding resources, the risk associated with suppression operations escalated to an unacceptable level. Multiple incidents were talking over each other resulting in miscommunication. In addition, neither the Box Elder Fire Warden nor the Bear River Area Forester was responding to telephone and radio calls.","Box Elder County Dispatch, Box Elder County Fire Warden, and the Bear River Area Forester must coordinate fire information to NUIFC. This information must include responding resources, frequencies, location, and pertinent size-up information. In addition, the Box Elder County Fire Warden and Area Forester must be accessible by phone and/or radio to ensure prompt responsiveness to issues pertaining to wildland fires within their jurisdiction.    I contacted the FMO from the Wasatch-Cache National Forest who was responding to another reported fire adjacent to National Forest land and asked him to find the Bear River Area Forester.

I did not as I was in the field. When I returned to station at 15:15 I looked at the internet fire weather site. Sure enough we were in Red Flag warning in the afternoon fire weather forecast. Our policy (forests wide) is to complete check-backs via radio with dispatch to ensure all resources are updated on this condition. When the fire weather was not read at the standard 4pm time I called dispatch to ask if they had seen the afternoon fire weather--and if so did they know our zone 624 had been upgraded to Red Flag. I was told 'no, we did not know that and we do not have time'. Weather for the afternoon was never read this day.

The same problem has surfaced on other recent fires in Southern CA (Paradise, Cedar, Pines, Old, etc).

The problem is ISSUANCE OF NON-STANDARD FREQUENCIES FOR COMMAND AND TACTICAL USE. Fire agencies in CA have gone to great lengths and expense to load the known VHF frequencies into mobiles and portables, including all published NIFC Commands and tacticals, along with the USFS Commands and Tacs for the region.

When NIFC or the GACC assigns frequencies, they have been assigning frequencies that are not on the published list. True, our portable radios can be programmed with the given frequencies once we are back at camp, but from the get-go until then, we operate in the blind or on the wrong channel. FIRESCOPE in CA has been very active in getting new frequencies added when they are known. Still, every year we are surprised with new ones.

This creates a SAFETY problem that has not been addressed. Those agencies that equip their apparatus with a mobile and each firefighter with a portable radio do so for safety purposes. When we appear in camp and are handed ONE portable (that we may not be familiar with) in order to continue to operate on the incident is accepting a lesser level of protection!

SOFRs should be aware of this practice, and be included in the decision loop. Assigning non-published frequencies creates a SAFETY HAZARD!","During times of multiple-incidents in a small geographic area, sometimes we run out of the NIFC frequencies for distribution. Other times, it seems that the new frequencies are incorporated while the regular NIFC frequencies are not used in the region. Why? Each region or operational area should have an 'order of preference' for the complete list of NIFC frequencies. Then the list should be followed. If the selection is off the list, then we could assume that any of the standard frequencies were not available due to previous use.    The safety issues of the issuance of unfamiliar radios and frequencies should be highlighted for the SOFRs and COMLs.","08/21/2006 00:00"

These problems are recurring and present a significant safety threat to ground and aerial resources.

At around 11:30 AM, the San Bernardino Dispatch went completely off the air due to radio problems associated with a dispatch center move (previously reported in another SAFENET). Today was a catastrophic failure resulting in all communications being lost for about thirty minutes while IA resources were responding to multiple IA fires (Schuh, Ramp, and Bear-F/A) and while IA aircraft was doing flight following. This failure was after a dry lightning storm moved through the area and while a non-IA urban interface (non-lightning) fire was being dispatched.

As a result of the communications failure, local fire management dispatched their units over the air after being informed by the FICC of the problem.

To compound the problem, interference (possible from NV-HTF) made what little communications that were available poor and intermittent. This interference has been well documented and not corrected. The interference needs inter-regional/national attention for correction.","This problem has already been addressed in a SAFENET from the local FICC Center Manager last month, without satisfactory local or regional correction. Appropriate attention needs to occur.

This information has been discussed with the Forest AFMO and District FMO. They are in concurrence that something needs to be done to correct the problem ASAP.

Forest AFMO is also requesting the FICC Center Manager to also submit another SAFENET with FICC (Dispatch Center) specific info on this incident.    This SAFENET has been discussed with the Forest AFMO and District FMO.

We are all available to comment via phone or e-mail on corrective measures needed.

San Bernardino FICC gave phone calls to all Chief Officers to advise them that the dispatch center was out of service and not able to transmit.

FICC advised Chief Officers of dispatches to incidents.

Local Chief Officers dispatched equipment via forest net and tracked their response to incidents.

FICC was able to use AFF to keep track of aircraft in the air, if aircraft were utilizing AFF. Local flight following was done in addition.

Local Chief Officers gave phone calls to the FICC to request additional equipment, give reports on conditions, and share critical information.

FICC went to handheld (HT) dispatching and then dispatching from non-completed dispatch consoles in the new SO. This allowed some communications that were gradually improved throughout the day. These consoles and this equipment has not been 'tuned' so it was of variable volume and clarity.

Yesterday, 07/18/06, an employee who is tasked with packing and refurbishing these kits was doing a routine refurb on the NFES 1835, First Aid Station 500+ person kit. While removing components from the box, the employee was poked in the thumb by a lancet. These are used to pierce the skin to draw blood for testing. The lancet was loose in the box and it was obvious it had been originally deposited in the sharps container which was in the proximity of the lancet, which would have been the proper disposition.

Two procedures were not followed at the incident that could have eliminated the potential for this to occur. First, anything that is deposited in the sharps container is potentially considered biohazard or regulated medical waste. The container has a sliding door on the lid that snaps shut and needs to be sealed with a 'Biohazard' label which is in the kit along with the sharps container. The sliding door in this case was not secured nor was the 'Biohazard' label attached. During transit back to Missoula from an incident in Arizona, The lancet fell out of the container.

The second procedure that was not followed is the responsibility of the Medical Unit Leader to ensure that anytime a sharps container is used to dispose of 'Biohazard' material, it must be determined how and where to dispose of locally. These items should never be returned in kits.

We understand the logistics of making this happen in some remote areas is difficult but it needs to be addressed. It does not happen often but this is our second encounter. The outcome in both cases could have been worse.

Note: The lancet in question is not a component to any kit produced at the Northern Rockies Fire Cache.","Policy and procedures regarding handling of 'Biohazard' should be reviewed and followed.

July 15th: They had started the day at Chino (Prado) Mobilization Center at 0700 hours. Had been in staging until 2100 hours and had been ordered to travel to the LPF for an assignment. He had a signed CTR with on shift starting at 0700, a lunch break and travel time starting at 2100 hours. They arrived at my District Office on July 16th at 0330 hours and proceeded to sleep in their truck until 0730, when employees started to arrive.

July 16th 0900: I asked them why they had been ordered to travel so late and they were told ' We (Prado) only have enough food for 350 people and we have to get rid of as many as we can tonight'

When I found out they had been on duty for over 20 hours, I advised them they would be fed and put down to rest for the remainder of the day. I was still coordinating lodging for the 3 other Out of State engines and hotels were booked up solid due to weekend events. We eventually managed to find rooms and sent them there in the afternoon. They did not return to duty that day.

This is a clear violation of incident work rest and abiding by incident driving regulations. The Chino (Prado) Mob Center was responsible for ordering this travel and should be held accountable.

We were working in Fuel Model-L and we had begun the firing operation at approx 0700. We observed multiple fire and ash vortices both backing into the wind and parallel with the wind all morning long and I recall telling the crew that we had a very long day ahead of us. At approx 1100 a dozer arrived to improve the line on the west flank of the fire, at this time the winds were in our favor and we continued working from north to south. At approx 1300 we had fired approximately three quarters of a mile and had tied into a good dirt road. We were told to take a break; we gathered up at the staging area and had lunch. We observed storm cells passing to the north and could hear thunder and once again the comment was made that we had a long day ahead of us.

At approx 1345 the I.C radioed to the hand crew leader and asked that he drive over to where we had finished firing to check things out. I told him that we would take our engine down the line form the north to south to see how it was holding and would meet the other engines. As we were heading south we noticed that the road that we had stopped firing at was not holding and when we arrived to this road we performed a mobile attack and created a check line with approx 40 yards of black.

At this time the wind started shifting form the north to the east very quickly and we began to expedite a firing operation from east to west. Approx 2 minutes into the operation it became obvious that the fire was beginning to out flank us and our objective was to disengage and travel west towards Hwy 15 and re-group.

As soon as we identified that everyone was accounted for, the wind completely shifted out of the south gusting approx 30mph. We made a rapid retreat down the dirt road and as the lead engine we had 10+ flame lengths on the left hand side of the road and multiple spot fires occurring in front of us with limited visibility. After all engines made it out safely we accounted for all personnel and checked the engines for damage.

A short time later an Air Attack platform was checking on scene with the I.C. and made the statement that our column had collapsed. We closed traffic on hwy 15 for approx 1 hour while the fire crossed over four traffic lanes both in front and behind of us.","Contributing Factors

• The WX- passing storm cells.

• The Fire Behavior- we observed erratic and extreme Fire Behavior all day long.

• Limited number of resources- there was another fire to the south threatening homes and we could not get any additional resources.

Recommendations:

* Maintain situational awareness, discuss fire behavior frequently throughout the day and share information with everyone.

* Conduct a thorough debriefing or after action review for every shift worked.    As an AAR we conducted and documented a Sand Table Exercise later in the week and discovered that we were not the only folks affected by this event. There was another engine crew over the ridge that listened to our radio traffic and they said that it was very emotional for them to feel helpless for our safety when this event transpired.

We discussed our original objectives, alternatives and individually described what we thought did and did not happen.

Upon arriving at the location a safety zone was established, in this case a good sized dirt field large enough for several engines. I made this safety zone known to the crew and to the engine driver/operator. I further instructed the driver/operator not to hesitate to drive through the barb wire fence if needed to get into the safety zone. During the next twenty minutes we stayed right next to the safety zone as the Captain scouted and reported back on the feasibility of saving structures. During this time I repeated where the safety zone was and not to hesitate to drive through a fence if needed three more times. Each time the driver/operator repeated my instructions regarding the safety zone back to me.

At around twenty minutes from first arriving and establishing the safety zone I was on the ground with the Module leaders from two other wildland engines talking about the possibility of doing a burn out. I thought it was impossible to hold and stated that I was putting my engine into the safety zone while there was plenty of time. My thought was to get the engine into the safety zone with time to spare, not wanting to put the driver/operator into a stressful situation as they were still fairly inexperienced. One of the other engines soon followed our lead and headed for the safety zone. Talking with the Module leader and driver of this engine after the incident we all agreed that there were about three minutes to get into the safety zone before the flame front reached us. To get into the safety zone we had to drive fifty feet and then back through a gate. This was a very straight forward task and simple in my opinion. A task that I knew the driver/operator could do as I had observed them backing into the engine bay numerous times without problem. A third engine was parked across the road from the gate but posed no obstacle to backing through the open gate. Upon reaching the gate the driver/operator did not swing the engine into the correct position to back cleanly through the gate. I got out and attempted to help back them in. The driver/operator then backed the engine and stopped, then pulled forward as they were concerned about hitting the parked engine. I thought we would clear it no problem as did the crewmembers inside the engine. This backing and then pulling forward continued for at least another seven times. During this time I was constantly motioning the driver/operator to continue to back up but they would stop and pull forward again and again. After a minute and a half I got up to window, the driver/operator rolled it down, and I gave a direct instruction to back in now never mind the fence. The driver/operator then backed in, stopped and pulled forward again. All this time we were blocking another engine from getting into the safety zone. At about the two minute mark (one minute until the flame front arrived) the driver/operator pulled forward further than before, leaned out the window and yelled at me saying “we have to get to the road”. I actually believed that they were going to drive off at that point. What “the road” was I don’t know nor did the driver/operator I believe. I was truly scared now, as this would have burned over the engine had the driver/operator driven off. I then ran to the window yelling to put the transmission into reverse and floor the throttle right now. The driver/operator did and blew through the fence into the safety zone where they promptly stopped, again blocking the other engine from getting into the safety zone through the gate. I ran to the window yelling to back up, she did and the other engine drove into the safety zone with 10 seconds to spare before the flame front hit.","","12/05/2006 00:00"

Instead the Engineer went right out into the flow of traffic right in front of a semi with vehicles next to the diesel and behind it.

This created a two frequency call sign naming configuration for field users of Shane Ridge FS and Shane Ridge BLM. The same naming configuration is also planned for a new repeater facility in the Pryor Mountains, Dry Head FS and Dry Head BLM (This is the issue).

Before this naming configuration was finalized the FS and BLM field units had a chance for input into the final outcome. I raised the concern that on a rapidly emerging fire incident that IA resources will not say FS Shane Ridge or BLM Shane Ridge, they will simply say Shane Ridge, adding in my opinion a major unnecessary safety issue. My concerns at the time were dismissed as a timing issue to get the equipment in place took precedence for the field season. Although the FS and BLM have the capability to scan each others frequencies and some of the local departments have this capability, you have to physically look at your radio for every communication to determine which repeater is being used if people don’t state FS or BLM repeater, thus causing the issue with Saunders fire. This issue is exactly what occurred on the Saunders fire of 7/10/2006. IA resources and dispatch were using both frequencies and not saying FS or BLM Shane Ridge which led to missed communications and additional confusion on the incident. Not all departments have pneumonic capabilities, some just have channel 1, 2, 3 etc. for displays which add another layer of confusion to the issue, mainly with our local volunteer departments.

Beartooth District CNF, Billings BLM Field Office and MT DNRC are part of the Billings Interagency Dispatch Center. Within this zone of broken federal jurisdiction lands are 7 counties all with numerous volunteer departments and their own specific radio frequencies who dispatch out of their respective 911 centers. During mutual aid fire events, any combination of federal and local govt resources can arrive on an incident. Radio communications has always been a challenge in these instances over the years. This issue just created another layer to that challenge","Change one of the agency call names for Shane Ridge and Dryhead repeaters. CNF has historically used Shane Ridge. Instead of BLM Shane Ridge call it Grove Creek repeater, which is a tributary of Shane Ridge. Same naming process could be used for Dry Head as well.

The smoke was dispatched through Northern Utah Interagency Fire Center (NUIFC) according the corresponding run card for that area. The following frequencies were assigned: Tac 4, A/G 2, Command Lake Mountain Net 1.

Upon dispatch the Squad responded using the command frequency, followed by the Engine and the Helicopter. An individual from the Squad notified NUIFC that he would be the contact for the Helicopter upon its arrival in the area.  As the Squad continued up Hobble Creek Canyon it became apparent that the assigned command frequency would not work in the area that the smoke was reported. Note: Lake mountain works at the mouth of Hobble Creek canyon although not further up canyon were Teat Mountain repeater is commonly used. The Squad switched to Teat Mountain and was able to communicate with NUIFC although very scratchy.

The Squad was unable to locate the smoke report following main roads. The individual decided to stop at Cherry campground to talk to the campground host to find if their was any information they might have for the Days Canyon trail head is in Cherry campground. The campground host was not available. The Squad individual instructed the squad to hike up Days Canyon trail to attempt a vantage point of the smoke report. The individual stayed at the vehicle to direct incoming resources (the Engine and the Helicopter). At this time the Squad individual attempted to contact NUIFC once again on Teat Mountain but was unable to reach the repeater. He then switched to Strawberry on Net 1. Although unable to reach NUIFC on Strawberry Net 1, the Engine responded informing the Squad individual that they had been using Strawberry on Net 2, and that they where in the area and where going to continue up canyon to search for the smoke report. The Squad individual switched to Strawberry Net 2 and was able to communicate with NUIFC clearly using Strawberry Net 2.

Shortly there after the Helicopter arrived in the area and the Squad individual was able to communicate with them using air to ground on the designated frequency (A/G 2). The Squad individual notified the Helicopter that they where having to use Strawberry Net 2 to communicate with NUIFC, the Helicopter responded that they where able to reach Lake Mountain Net 1 from their vantage.

No responding resources where able to locate the reported smoke and returned back to quarters at approximately 1800.

On July 8th, 2006, the Engine was able to locate the reported smoke and named it the Nellie Fire. The Squad was also dispatched to the fire and assisted the Engine. Upon returning to the vehicles that evening Nellie IC and the Squad individual discussed the use of the Strawberry repeater. Nellie IC attempted to contact NUIFC using Strawberry Net 1 but was unable to do so, confirming that Strawberry is not a frequency that NUIFC monitors.","On this incident there were no accidents, close calls, or lack of pertinent information being communicated due to the time with no communication with NUIFC. Although with several units responding to the incident including an aircraft, the lack of communication could have become a larger problem.

The issue is two fold. The first issue is a run card telling responding units to use a frequency that works in only part of the response area. Note: Lake Mountain is a reliable repeater at the mouth of Hobble Creek. Secondly, the repeater that does work in this area, listed on frequency lists and programmed into all forest radios, is not programmed or monitored by NUIFC (this is only proven by repeated attempts to reach NUIFC on 7-7-06 and by the Nellie IC on 7-8-06).

I recommend that the run-cards for this response area include other repeaters that work in this area. I also recommend that Strawberry Net 1 either be removed from all frequency lists and removed from radios to avoid confusion for responding resources, or that the reasoning for NUIFC not having this frequency be resolved in order for this to be a valid repeater.","07/08/2006 00:00"

When I arrived to the fire it was 300 acres in steep terrain and limited access to the Virgin repeater. The fire was rapidly growing in size and was threatening the repeater. I had multiple air resources working the fire with low to moderate success of slowing the fire down. After 3hrs of working the fire I asked for a load of jumpers with an ICT3. Eight jumpers were in the process of jumping the fire.

(My Concerns) Before all the jumpers were on the ground and gathered their gear the JUMPER ICT3 had contacted dispatch and said 'I’m the IC'. At this time I am still working the fire and expecting to have a face to face with the ICT3 and do the transition from a type 4 to a 3 incident. 1/2 hour later contact is made with the ICT3 via radio, he wants me (ICT4) and all personnel on the fire to hike to him and have a 'Chit Chat.' It is a 1/2 hr hike to where he is located which is in the green and currently I’m working with my air support in coordinating retardant drops along with following up the drops with firefighters to catch the flaming front before it reaches the Virgin repeater. Eventually he hikes to a good point where we can make the transition. I tried to work with him on the transition and all he did was smile shake his head up and down and fiddle with his radio. Fire activity at this time was slowing down substantially from the work that my crew was doing. The only two questions he did ask were:

1. What resources did I have on the fire and coming to the fire?

2. When did it start?

After our extremely short briefing/transition my crews worked the fire for another hour and then were flown off the fire. I am part of a Helitack crew and it was agreed upon that we would be released for local I.A.

(My view) As soon as he hit the ground he jumped right in and overrode everyone and started to try managing the fire with only being on the ground for a couple minutes. The Jumper ICT3 wanted us (all personnel on the fire) to leave an active fire so we could, and I quote 'chit chat.' We dropped several loads of retardants throughout the afternoon and were starting to get the upper hand on the fire. 1/2 hour hike both ways to the jumpers plus the time to do a transition and brief it would have taken well over an hour of time with no one working the fire during the most active part of the day. When he was trying to manage the fire it was extremely ineffective because of his communication problems. He couldn't program his own radio, I had to show him. Air resources were confused with the changed strategies. The ICT3 just started directing them with out letting them know what his plans were. When we had our face to face, things he never asked that he should have addressed were what LCES I had established, hazards, locally threatened areas i.e. Virgin repeater, tactics and strategies, fire behavior, weather conditions, and communication plan.","I have transitioned fires to ICT3 before but this is my first experience of doing a transition of a fire to an ICT3 jumper. A professionalism and attention for following policies and procedures that I have been taught from NWCG guidelines seemed to be a minimal concern for him. With him on the fire he seemed to be a huge liability and not an asset. In hind sight I wish I never would have made the request. Because of weather conditions, air resources (excluding jumpers) and my crew, we ended up catching the fire during the drawn out time frame that it took the ICT3 jumper to get himself organized and in order to take over the incident.    During the time of our face to face briefing I took notice of his approach towards taking over this fire. He didn't ask for much information during our briefing. When I knew he wanted to work the fire I finished telling him the rest of the information that he didn't ask for that I felt he should know as he walked away from me.","07/06/2006 00:00"

Once over the incident it was determined to be approx. 3 ac. burning actively on a 70% slope primarily in FM2. The decision was made from the air to order 2 more sticks of rappellers and attempt to hold the fire to the aspect that it was involved on by constructing line around the base and flanks, and then utilizing the ridge across the head. The six rappellers w/ an ICT5 command structure and bucket support from H401 had the fire lined at approx. 15-17 ac. by 2330 hrs. The following morning mop-up began on the fire with blivet support. By 1230 hrs. that day the ICT5(T) and the ICT5/ICT4(T) decided to transition to an ICT4 command structure and order additional resources due to roll-out potential, roll-out occurring on the back side of the ridge, interior flare-ups, and the fact that we were nearly at our minimum rh from the day before already. One more stick of rappellers from the Challis Rappel Base, including a qualified ICT4, rappelled in. Then a helispot was cut and 2 Salmon BLM engine crewmembers as well as a five person Hand Crew from the South Zone of the forest were flown into the fire. They continued lining roll-outs/slops t/o the afternoon with support from H401 and H405. Four of the original Indianola Rappllers were demobed b/f pumpkin b/c they had timed out at 14 days. All resources were back at the campsite located near the base of the incident by approx. 2230 hrs. Between approx. 2230 and 2330 hrs. the ICT4(T) was notified by Long Tom Lookout and Central Idaho Dispatch that a severe thunderstorm was tracking in the direction of the incident from the Payette NF and across the Frank Church Wilderness. As the intense lightning activity quickly approached the ICT4(T) advised all personnel to 'hunker down' in a location that they felt was safe. All Dutch Oven incident personnel elected to remain at the original base camp, with the exception of two Challis Rappellers, two Indianola Rappellers, and one fuels technician (?) from the South Zone hand crew. These five individuals made a rapid decent down the mountain to a potentially more secure location to ride out the storm. After hiking for approx. 30 min. the South Zone hand crewmember reached a location that he felt safe. He had an operational radio so he remained in that location while the four rappellers attempted to get lower on the mountain b/f the storm arrived. These four individuals hiked approx. 15 more minutes before 'hunkering down' as the storm arrived. After the intense lightning storm had passed the four individuals began to come out from their tarps when one of them heard pine cones rolling down the mountain. Another member of this party shined his light in the direction of the noise to find a full-grown mountain lion crouching beside a tree approximately 15 yds. away. The individuals then built a fire to scare the animal away with some difficulty in the damp grass utilizing a fusee as they advised Central Idaho Dispatch of the situation. After the fire was established the animal backed away to a rock outcropping about 30-50 yds. and remained at that distance for several hours. The party vigilantly attempted to maintain a visual on the animal's eyes and occasionally it's body t/o the night hours. At one point a second slightly smaller set of eyes were discovered in the same outcropping. Both of the mountain lions in the nearby rock outcropping were monitored t/o the night. The individuals attempted to scare the animals away t/o the night by yelling and throwing rocks, to no avail. The party also attempted to contact the other personnel on the fire for assistance (chain saw, etc.) unsuccessfully, as they had turned off their radios with the storm passage. At approx. 30 min. b/f daylight the larger of the mountain lions became very restless pacing back and forth, circling below the four individuals and ultimately closing in to approx. 20 yds. At this point the ICT4 informed Central Idaho Dispatch that we had an emergency and needed assistance. Central Idaho Dispatch/Long Tom Lookout contacted the duty officer/Superintendent 401/the pilot and advised them of the situation. Supt. 401 and the pilot responded to Indianola and readied H401 to fly at daylight for an extraction mission. The mountain lions continued their restless movement at approx. 5 to 10 min. before the sun came up and we watched them move up the mountain and out of sight. The 4 rappellers hiked down the mountain to a nearby area suitable for an LZ. At this point the personnel that had remained in camp were raised on the radio and a transfer of command took place back to an ICT5 structure for the final gridding ops. H401 arrived at the site and backhauled the personnel at approx. 0600.","1. More complete training on mountain lion, bear, and wolf safety would be extremely beneficial for all personnel participating in fire suppression in the Salmon River Breaks.

2. A program similar to the Alaska Fire Service firearm training and certification program should seriously be considered for individuals engaged in suppression activities where known run-ins with wild animals have previously occurred. There are no doubt many more similar situations that go unreported each season. This season alone mountain lions have been sighted on four additional occasions by Indianola personnel at the base or in close proximity to the base on the Salmon River Road.

3. Another mitigation measure that would be beneficial is to have personnel in the Salmon River Breaks avoid working alone on portions of the fire. For example, the final size of this fire was 18.6 ac. and there were many occasions when one person was working on a portion of the fire by themselves while serving as a lookout or hiking back to patrol constructed line for roll-outs and slopovers.    The four individuals mitigated the situation by building a fire to scare the animals away, throwing rocks, yelling, and ultimately requesting helo extraction to the inherent danger of the situation. All four personnel were off the clock the next day in order to comply with the 2:1 work rest ratio.","07/21/2006 00:00"

We first noticed the panels didn't make a true circle when placed together and didn't match with the tarp circle that was used as the base pad for the heliwell. As we continued, the cables used to wrap around the panels to hold them together were short by 3 feet. At this point we called the company to discuss the problem and they were to send additional cables. Instead of sending the correct length of cable, the company sent chains and C-clamps that were made out a galvanized metal and we were told that these items should work so we can still use the heliwell until we get through the fire season.

The next step was to get the liner in place and the liner didn't fit within the panels according to how the instructions were given in the manual. The liner was adjusted as best we could get it and started to fill with water. Once the liner reached 12,000 gals., the liner failed and split the seam at the fill valve. We found out later, after we put the second liner in, that the liner failure was due to the panels not fitting together in a true circle because of the L-brackets (holding brackets) were welded in the wrong place.

After we placed the second liner in the tank and filled to full capacity (15,000 gals), within 15 minutes, the C-clamp failed and whipped the cable out from the holding bracket. Anyone standing within 3 feet of the cable would have been seriously injured. Once the clamp gave-way, the panels swelled in the area where the cable was putting additional pressure on the existing cables. We taped off the area around the tank to keep people away. Several other clamps did fail over the next month and completely buckled the panels. Closer inspection of the C-clamp showed that it was only rated for 600 lbs.","Company needs to ensure all equipment is functional and inspected before shipment.

The chase truck was going to take me to our guard station, and drop me off to pick up a government truck that I was using to commute back and forth during my detail on the Type 3 engine. While the chase truck was dropping me off to get my truck at the guard station, our Engine drove up on a single vehicle accident on Hwy 87. The Engine stopped to render aid. Both the chase truck and my self, 'in my chase vehicle' waited at the junction of Hwy 87 and the guard station road.

I sent the chase truck back down to the guard station and I waited in my chase truck for them to return and for the Engine to clear from the accident they were dealing with. While all this was going on, there was an incredible lightning storm happening. While I was waiting for the engine to clear the accident and the chase truck to return from the guard station, 'My vehicle was struck by lightning'.

We had a fire (the Isabel fire) escape IA early this week and had a Type II Team transition in. As part of the transition we wanted to provide them with our pocket card.

Apparently, someone in Rawlins dispatch constructed their own card, which contained many errors, and without letting the Forest know, posted it on their web-page. Personnel from our Supervisor’s Office went to the Rawlins Dispatch web-page, printed out the pocket card, and it was dispersed to the Team for morning briefing.

The card on the web-page was not the one prepared by the Forest, but one prepared by personnel in the Rawlins Dispatch Center. The pocket card contained numerous errors, some of which are listed below:

1. Local Watch Out Thresholds that were identified on the pocket card were wind speed over 0 mph, RH less than 61%, Temperature over 59 degrees. These values are blatantly incorrect.

2. The fire danger area identified was incorrect and included Laramie Peak (weather zone 294). Laramie Peak is represented by the Esterbrook RAWS, as is Pole Mountain (which was also not mentioned on the card).

3. Listed were fires on the pocket card ERC graph which did not occur in the zone represented by the Sawmill RAWS and are meaningless in this type of analysis. Not only are they meaningless, but they paint an incorrect picture of how our large fires have historically related to ERC!

4. In the Past Experience section, the card did not list any past fire-related experiences, but some nebulous conditions that might be found in 'some' areas on the Forest (i.e. 'stairways to the crowns').

5. It was stated on the pocket card that 'Cheyenne Weather for June 2005' was used. Two problems here: (1) the weather used should have come from the Sawmill Park RAWS via KCFast from the Fire and Aviation web-page (this has nothing to do with Cheyenne weather), and (2) the card indicated that weather from the month of June 2005 was used, when in actuality, the weather is for the Sawmill RAWS and is a yearly average from 1987 to 2005 (18 year average) for the entire fire season (May through October), not just June, 2005.

The inaccuracies of the card have the potential to create safety issues for incoming resources and it needs to be removed from the Rawlins Dispatch web-page ASAP.","The Rawlins Dispatch center personnel responsible need to be held accountable for their actions.

We called EUSC (ticket number 2149677) and were informed that they do not support WildCad and would do nothing for us. They stated that the problem was something in our system and we had to fix it. They went so far as to instruct us to investigate our IP config which said our DNS suffix: is Blank. They said that is bad but would not fix it.

However, when we approached them with the problem, EUSC, who are responsible for computer functions, would not support WildCad, (which in not the problem.) We do not understand how they can not be responsible for the whole computer system here when they have the ability, and have exercised this ability, to change our computer functions and affect all parts of our system, including WildCad. Our major concern is that this severely affected the dispatch capability of an interagency dispatch center. Basically removed from us the ability to do our job. The WildCad system is not malfunctioning, the ability to share files has been compromised by EUSC/IT personnel in the interest of security. We are not the only Center experiencing this problem.","EUSC/IT need to realize that CAD systems need to be shared. If they are going to reconfigure anything in an emergency office setting they need to contact us to see if it will impact the ability for us to do our jobs.

The missed or delayed red flag warning put firefighter safety at a significant risk during extreme fire weather and fire behavior conditions.

On Tuesday, June 13, 2006, at 0401 hrs, the National Weather Service Office (NWS) in Cheyenne, Wyoming issued a fire weather watch for portions of (not all of) southeast Wyoming for Wednesday, June 14, 2006, based on a forecasted high wind, low humidity, and dry fuel conditions (pre-frontal conditions). The watch for portions of southeast Wyoming was upgraded to a red flag warning on June 13, 2006 at 1209 hrs, and updated again at 0435 hrs on Wednesday, June 14, 2006. At the time of the watch and warning disseminations, zone 290 in southeast Wyoming was excluded.

The exclusion of the zone was based on a report that fuels were not favorable for large fire growth when fire weather red flag thresholds are met (RH less 15% and wind gusts 25 mph or greater) and that 'green' fuel conditions were in place. In the Rocky Mountain Area, this information is relayed by interagency fire management to the NWS using the Rocky Mountain Area Fuels Status web page. This web page provides a 'Yes' or 'No' answer (and remarks) to fuel conditions to the NWS offices in the Rocky Mountain Area, and is outlined in the 2006 Rocky Mountain Area interagency fire weather operating plan as the agreed way we coordinate fuel conditions. The AOP is signed by NWS and Fire Management representatives. FMOs and or Fuel Specialists responsible for relaying the fuels information to the NWS have been briefed and trained by Rocky Mountain Area Predictive Services personnel.

On Wednesday, June 14, 2006, red flag conditions were prevalent across much of Colorado and southern Wyoming. The Cheyenne NWS raised concerns early in the day that fire weather zone 290 was not included in the warning (because of reported fuel conditions), with reports of large fire activity in this zone. Further coordination by the Cheyenne NWS with fire management personnel, NWS concerns of inaccurate fuel information, and NWS concerns of firefighter safety resulted in a red flag warning issued for zone 290 in southeast Wyoming at 1420 hrs, despite the fact that the fuels status indicated that the fuel conditions did not support large fires.

The failure to relay critical fuel conditions to the NWS resulted in a significant delay to issue fire weather watches and red flag warnings for zone 290 to heighten awareness of a significant fire weather event. The Tracer Incident was reported at 1600 acres in zone 290 at 1800 hrs on June 14, 2006. The incident IC stated that the major problems were gusty winds, low humidity and resource shortages.

These types of events and communication break downs in the past have resulted in firefighter fatalities.","All fire management agencies responsible for relaying fuel information in the Rocky Mountain Area to the NWS in support of the red flag program should be reminded by their direct supervisor that these duties will be performed at least once per week and as fuel conditions change.    I change the fuel status web page for zone 290 to reflect actual conditions. I promptly relayed this information to the NWS. However, this is a short-term fix.

While attempting to work the order from home via laptop and VPN, I encountered significant problems accessing various necessary 'remote' programs.

After calling help desks and status lines (and trying a number of work arounds) I determined that the FS VPN functionality was down... and 'there is no timeline on when a fix may be available.'

Our local dispatch center's emergency fallback plan if we lose net and server access (we have no alternative internet access) is to find a place with internet access and set up shop with laptops. To discover that the corporate VPN is not reliable means that access to chunks of our data won't be available when we really need it.

Despite repeated pleas to the Agencies to provide redundant network and inter/intranet access for emergency centers, there has been no discernable movement toward providing consistent and reliable support. After hours and weekend access is particularly weak as the agency IT administrators seem to assume that the whole work force is absent outside m-f 9-5.

After action reviews consistently point to dispatch support as critical to safe and effective incident management. I wonder how many hugely expensive fatality accidents have to occur before the 'system' starts to spend adequate monies to ensure 24 x 7 support to the dispatch community.","Redundant access to internet/intranet/server resources at the dispatch center. Solid and dependable off site VPN access to the same resources when power loss outlasts UPS capabilities or when immediate action mitigates against off hour trips back to the dispatch office    I've mentioned these vulnerabilities in various forums over the years.

This particular problem was unresolvable due to the indeterminate response of the FS IT shop, i.e. the 'no idea when the problem will be fixed' response posted on the End User Support Center server status line.

The workaround turned out to be alternately joining and leaving the VPN to access server data OR the internet (and associated web based programs). The FS intranet was never available.

The most immediate 'fix' would be to get the corporate VPN back up and running. Next would be to provide an alternative VPN usable when the main program crashes as it inevitably will.","06/06/2006 00:00"

The probable cause of this incident was.

A. Being to close to the fire and not following proper procedures.

B. Winter Blend Fuel, found along the Front Range of Colorado from Oct 1 to around May 1. This fuel has chemicals added to increase the volatility of the gasoline for cold starts and for pollution control.

The saw was not out of gas but it was most likely vapor locking making the saw seem as if it was out of gas.

Poor radio communications on the Rio Grande N.F.

Problems -

Since the RGNF started using Pueblo Dispatch, approx. a year and a half ago, radio commo has been sketchy at best. Currently, the Saguache R.D. cannot communicate with Dispatch on the Direct Frequency, and has to use repeaters that have been unreliable. On several occasions in the past three months, local dispatch has been established, to mitigate poor commo with Pueblo, during wildland and prescribed fires. Overall radio commo with Pueblo is poor.

Inter-forest radio commo has also deteriorated recently. The Saguache R.D. base station can transmit to resources in the forest, via Direct, but is unable to receive on Direct, thus having to use repeaters.

Safety Issues -

As previously stated, local dispatch has been established during wildland and prescribed fires recently, due to poor commo with Pueblo. The RGNF has just established fire restrictions and is expecting severity resources this weekend. High fire danger, resources unfamiliar with the area, and poor commo with dispatch is certainly a red flag in the event of a wildland incident. Under these circumstances, the time needed to establish a local dispatch, would delay any engagement of a wildland fire, putting both the public and fire fighters at a greater risk.

These issues aren't confined to fire operations. On 05/31/2006 Saguache District employees were working on the southern end of the district, in an area that should have no radio issues. One of the employees had become seriously dehydrated and was suffering from heat exhaustion. She became dizzy, was extremely pale, and passed out. Fortunately, her co-workers recognized her symptoms and treated her properly, but they were unable to establish radio contact with Saguache. They eventually got in contact with the Divide District, who provided a telephone relay to their supervisor. Luckily this incident ended well, and the employee recovered quickly, but it does demonstrate the fact that the RGNF radio communication is not adequate.

Many EUSC Tickets have been initiated and closed, and we certainly appreciate the support and efforts from our radio techs (they worked on the Saguache radios earlier this week), however these problems still persist.","From what I've gathered, talking to the radio techs, dispatch personnel, and FS personnel, the RGNF radio system is trying to be patched together. Older systems are trying to be couple with modern systems, and integration is not working. I think the entire network and link to Pueblo needs to be assessed and probably needs to be reworked.

The other option would be to establish a permanent (at least during fire/field season) Forest Dispatch, and invest in making the inter-forest network work properly.","06/02/2006 00:00"

This has gone to the point of having to hold all radio communication traffic on the opposite forest channel frequency to prevent the bleed over that happens which is completely covering the on going fire emergency traffic each time the dispatcher keys up to talk. So this leaves one side of the forest without communication with dispatch during the event. The most recent bleed over problems have migrated on to National flight following where the Prescott Dispatch Center was hearing the daily weather being read by the A-S Dispatch Center clearly. I would think that this would be an Aviation Safety issue that EUSC would elevate the ticket but not so; it is just another ticket since it is not a going fire incident that will be dealt with in order from ISO and most likely closed with no repair action as has happened to the last ticket on this bleed over problem a few days ago. The safety issue continues to be lack of reliable and clear communications between the Dispatcher responsible for supporting and directing resource to the emergency and maintaining communications between the IC on the emergency and adjacent responders. And with the Aviation channel now being effected as well.","This is clearly not the wide band vs. narrow band issue.

As was identified from National radio communication group, ISO has not been and continues to be unresponsive to the fire organizations needs for clear and reliable communications on both large on going emergencies incidents as well as the daily fire business operations. Both the National Fire and Aviation Executive Board (NFAEB) and the Southwest Region Fire and Aviation Management Fire Operations (SWR3 FAM) have addressed the common narrow vs. wide band problems. To date the NFAEB charter interagency group tasked November 17, 2005 has not progressed to address the objective of determining the status of radios used in dispatch to ensure correct configuration. The SWR3 FAM has identified October 19, 2005 that responsibility for providing program direction versus support by ISO at any level was not well understood and that clear direction and management oversight was lacking and remains stagnated in that state currently. The Fire Safety Teams found in Oct. that this issue caused high emotional and safety concerns at all levels of fire field level organization this situation also has not changed in fact it is getting worst. The feeling is that it will take a major accident or fatality to bring the ISO support and communication repair problems back to the fore front and dealt with in a timely manner.

We were working a fire the evening before and had to bed down that night in the field. In order to save power on the battery we turned the radio off since it is wired direct to the battery. In the morning we turned the radio back on and the display read 'PARMS FAIL'. When this is on the display the radio is unusable. We notified dispatch and our FMO of the problem that day (Saturday 5/20/06) and had it 'fixed' that Monday morning. On 5/24/06 while driving the radio went dead and displayed 'PARMS' for barely a second. It was just a flash and then it was back to normal. The radio has been functional since then.

During the 05 fire season the EF Johnson displayed 'PARMS FAIL' and was dead on three different occasions. To fix the problem the radio was replaced in the winter with a radio from an engine that was no longer in service. As you know communication is one of our safety cornerstones. When we lose our mobile communications we do have some back up options including hand held radios and cell phones, but they are not as reliable as a good mobile radio. If we are using our engine in a tactical operation on a fire and lose our mobile radio it will mean disengaging temporarily and maybe permanently. If these radios continue to have problems during the fire season it could turn into a major safety issue.","Our radio techs are working hard to remedy the problem. From what I understand it seems to be an issue at the vendor level. The company is not sure why this is happening and has been unable to offer the radio technicians much help.

Initial radio communications with Pueblo dispatch was adequate, while en route through the valley, but deteriorated rapidly as we entered the forest. I tried both Boot Mtn. and Methodist repeaters, and while I could key them up and open them, I could not make contact with Pueblo. All resources responding to this incident (DFMO, the engine, and myself), had problems contacting Pueblo dispatch. Once we arrived at the staging area below the fire, I tried Pueblo may times on any repeater I could hit, and was unable to establish contact. At that point I was able to make contact via satellite phone and inform them of the resources that had arrived. My DFMO and I discussed the situation and decided to get to the fire scene, get a size up, and then utilize the sat phone as our communication link to dispatch. Once at the fire scene, we made the decision to engage the fire, due to it being less than a tenth of an acre and exhibiting very little fire behavior. I was still unable to establish adequate radio contact with Pueblo dispatch, and used the sat phone for that link.

This incident was the second wildland fire incident in a week on the RGNF, and on both occasions radio communications with Pueblo dispatch was not adequate. Since the RGNF started using off forest dispatch, radio communications with Pueblo has been questionable at best and non-existent many times. While the RGNF has many terrain issues, and known dead spots, radio communications have become much worse since switching to Pueblo. As I understand it, the coupling of the RGNF radio system with the Pueblo system is the root of the problem. Pueblo dispatch personnel have been very helpful, concerned and patient with this problem as well.

At this point I have grave concerns, heading into what may be a very busy fire season, with such poor communications between my crew and dispatch. Under these circumstances, I'm very reluctant to commit my crew to a fire. If the need arises for additional resources or a medi-vac, I'm not confident I have the tools to get them, making a critical situation extremely dangerous.","","05/23/2006 00:00"

Initial attack resources had been dispatched (Divide Ranger District IA) and I requested notification of the Rio Grande County Sheriffs Office as well. Local VFD's were also believed to be responding. I staged 2 Type 6 engines w/crews if additional support was needed. These were later requested for additional support. Throughout the response, radio communication between the RGF resources and PIDC was hit-and-miss. Therefore I placed a RADO in the Monte Vista Forest Supervisors Office as a relay from the incident to Monte Vista to PIDC. Radio communication was intermittent with some ability to receive commo from PIDC on the fire scene and then not. There was also some ability for PIDC to receive commo from the scene but then again not. Satellite phone was used as a backup for communication. Fortunately this turned out to be a .25 acre lighting caused fire in sparse fuels with low spread potential and no aircraft was involved. There was potential for an aviation accident scene to be protected & investigated, possible medical needs or worse, as well as fire containment, cooperator coordination, NTSB involvement etc and essentially no ability to effectively communicate with PIDC. PIDC initiated a Priority 1 Radio Repair Ticket through End User Support (ticket #022106398) @ 1619 hr's on 5/16/06.

The Rio Grande Forest radio system has been problematic throughout the spring of 2006. Conducting prescribed burn projects has required additional Forest level staffing to relay to PIDC. Technicians continue to attempt repair. All resource areas are affected.","The RGF has experienced continuous radio problems since attempting to communicate with PIDC during the initial season of fully utilizing the Pueblo Interagency Dispatch office beginning spring of 2005. The issue seems to be geographical in nature with the Sangre de Cristo mountain range between the RGF & PIDC. Multiple repair tickets have been submitted to EUSC. New equipment (spread spectrum) has been ordered to improve the radio connection to PIDC. Some equipment is installed and some is not. Meanwhile, we are entering the 2006 fire season with extreme drought conditions and potential for a very active fire season. The on-Forest radio communication is also poor at this time. I really see 2 issues. 1) On-Forest radio Communication and 2) Radio Communication with PIDC. I expect radio technicians will resolve the on-Forest radio communication issue. However, radio communication between the RGF & PIDC has never been 100% satisfactory. Therefore, I recommend the RGF be authorized and financed to establish a 7-day per week fire RADO position to be able to 'patch' communication between the RGF & PIDC. In lieu of this, I see a need to re-establish a 4th tier Dispatch for the federal agencies in the San Luis Valley.    See above

* Backup communication w/ satellite phone was utilized

* Use of RADO for relay to PIDC was initiated

Of course the regular employees knows who it is then they start talking to them and then documents what the conversation was. For the detailer there is no room for error here. As being from the outside no consideration as to how people are on the radios. The detailer tries to comply but with little help until a small fire pops. Then when no one can be heard except lookout towers that was a different story. The regular personnel took over the dispatch and was doing Aircraft and regular dispatch then advises that documentation was not written down when in fact it was in front of her as she didn't want to admit she was wrong.

The weather was hot in the 101's, terrain; well it was off hwy it did have potential if needed. The result was it was only one acre fire, had it been more the detail personnel would have been in trouble as the fire people refuses to use radio right. They start talking before they key up so that leaves out the pertinent information as to whom the dispatch is talking to or they just don't know how to transmit on the radio properly.

Where we crossed over was a backing fire with flames 6-10 inches high in short grass fuels. After crossing the fire line the vehicle stalled. At the time of stalling the vehicle was 20 ft past the backing fire we had just crossed and we were 70 ft from the tilled field. At that time one of the crew members noticed that the vehicle was on fire. We successfully extinguished the vehicle fire. The fire was confined to the area immediately around the fuel tank fill hole. Burning material was limited to the diesel fuel that had leaked from the fill cap. There was no noticeable accumulation of vegetative debris on the vehicle. Damage to the vehicle was limited to minimal melting of the fuel cap and areas adjacent to the fuel cap. I was unable to restart the vehicle. I assumed the fuel line had been burned. (In fact the vehicle could be started but I had not moved the shift lever to neutral and the neutral start safety switch prevented the vehicle from starting.) We proceeded to put in wet line and burn out around the vehicle.

The station does routine equipment checks prior to operations. These checks are documented. ATVs are rehabed after every burn or wildfire.

In the AAR following this event:

It was noted that the fuel cap had been leaking for a number of days.

The vehicle's air intake is located directly above the fuel tank fill. It appears that the smoke and other combustion gases from the fire entered the air intake and caused the vehicle to stall. This is the only occurrence of stalling by this vehicle.

There was no noticeable accumulation of debris on the vehicle following the vehicle fire or at other times over the fire season.

The operator was ATV certified.

The operator was familiar with the operation of the vehicle.","Vehicle has been removed from fire line use until a new fuel cap can be acquired. In discussion with Kubota dealers, we learned that other vehicles had a similar leaky fuel cap problems and replacement fuel caps are in short supply.

Reemphasize in annual orientation, 6 minutes for safety sessions, initial and refresher ATV training, in burn plans and during pre-burn briefing:

Do not utilize vehicles with fuel leaks on fire line. Remove them from fire service until they can be repaired.

Review the station's “lock out tag out “ procedure and ensure all staff are aware of it. Equipment with known fuel leaks are to be locked out for fire operations.

During rehab be sure to inspect and remove any debris accumulation around the fuel tank area.

Develop drill to simulate vehicle re-starting under stress.

Driving thru flames should be avoided. If driving thru flames must be done, the operator should inspect the ATV immediately after to ensure no fire is picked up.

Weather conditions were Temp. 80 Humidity 25% Winds from the south 10 to 20 mph. We were dispatched to an area around the town of Dry Creek, upon arrival the fire was about 400 acres and traveling at a high rate of spread. Fuels were a mature Pine plantation, trees were about 40 total. We were under the direction of an employee of the State of Louisiana. Our instructions were to find a road system ahead of the fire and burn out ahead of the approaching fire front. At this point the fire was traveling north towards an area of homes and ranches. I advised my resources to follow the 10 and 18 and be sure of LCES. Our first attempt at burn out failed as the fire front jumped the road. We backed off about 1/4 of a mile to a road system that the OPS thought would provide the time to burn out and provide an escape route. The tractor was unloaded to provide back up in case of spotting. All the vehicles were parked at a road junction. The two engine crew persons proceeded with burnout operations under the direction of the State OPS. I stayed at the intersection with the tractor operator to hold the road system. Burnout operations were proceeding well, but as the fire front approached the wind switched from the south to the east in the direction of myself and the dozer operator. In the time span of about a minute the fire front had overtaken us and was burning on all sides of us. I could not locate the tractor operator at this time as he was working a spot about 100 yards from me. At this point I opted for the escape route and drove thru the fire front to the safety zone (a burned over clear cut) I expected the tractor operator to do the same, as there was another vehicle at the intersection to use. He remained at the intersection and moved the vehicles to the middle of it (engine, tractor ,transport, OPS vehicle). Louisiana State does not require fire clothes or shelters and he had none. As I made it to the Safety Zone I contacted the tractor operator to find out where he was. He was ok but very shaken up and informed me that none of the vehicles had burned up and he was uninjured. The only damage was to my vehicle, burn holes in the carpet bed liner.","No air support was available at the time, and as there was no slope having a lookout was not possible. The chain of command from the state was not stated and as happened on many fires with them a plan was not communicated well.

For over a year there have been 2 fire management officer positions vacant. These positions have been filled with detailers for 1 full fire season, going on its 2nd year with personnel filling in from the forest. These employees have done detail after detail to fill these vacant positions to the point where they are not being compensated for the detail, just someone to fill a slot to get by. Pay is not the issue of concern with this Safenet. The forest reorganized their fire structure which turned these 2 FMO's into Zone FMO's. So currently there is neither an East nor West Zone Fire Management Officer. The individuals filling in as detailers are the District Assistant Fire Management Officers, thus 2 more D-AFMO positions are unstaffed.

The Taos Zone Center Manager has been vacant for over 7 months also relying upon detailers to fill the position. Currently the position is not staffed with a detailer, but the job is being performed by a regular dispatcher who is temporarily acting as the Zone Center Manager. This individual has been given a temporary upgrade to a GS-08, but the Position Description for the Center Manager is at the GS-11 pay grade. The responsibilities for this position far exceed the responsibilities of a regular dispatcher temporarily getting paid at the GS-08 pay grade. Once again, pay is not the concern with this Safenet.

Currently the Forest Fire Staff Officer position is vacant. It too is being filled with a detailer (the detailer is the Forest Assistant Fire Staff Officer, leaving the position of the Assistant Fire Staff Officer vacant.

Serious concerns for fire management, leadership, supervision, fire experience/qualifications, span of control, local incident management and unit cohesion with the upcoming fire season and related drought/fire conditions have prompted most individuals in the fire organization on the forest to disengage as a safe/effective/efficient workforce.","Have a forest level review of the current upper level management to include the Forest Leadership Team and their priorities in resolving these vacancies in critical fire management positions other than using on forest detailers for multiple back to back details.

These jobs were advertised once with only one qualified applicant for both Zone FMO positions. The Center Manager had only a couple Applicants and the Forest Fire Staff position still has not been advertised. Currently there are Outreaches for all of these critical fire management positions. But fire season is here and current conditions (i.e. fuel moistures, ERC's, spring winds, low RH's) have the potential to create dangerous conditions for forest service fire employees or other responding units to forest related fire incidents. Most importantly the safety is compromised of all personnel engaged in fire suppression activities.

The holes in the Swiss Cheese model for organizational influences, unsafe supervision and preconditions for unsafe acts are lining up and the last thing needed is to have anyone in the fire community get injured or killed due to in-action.    Concerns have been communicated without action taken.","03/07/2006 00:00"

Model III Motorola ASTRO XTS 5000

While on a 1 day Rx burn of approximately 200 acres in a majority model 3 fuel type, problems with radio communications developed. New digital radios were issued to the fire crew this burning season and notable field use issues have developed. Over the course of the day of the Rx burn, lack of 'good' communications became more and more evident.

It should be noted that these situations have occurred in a very flat environment with an elevation change of less then 5 feet. Portable to portable direct communications are typically used across open ground with occasional very thin stands of trees between the users. The range of the radio users is typically within 250 yards (often a lot less) with a typical maximum use of approximately 0.5 miles.

After the first use of this new radio system it was noted that many members of the crew did not know how to properly make use of all of the functions of the new radios. This was remedied with a multiple hour meeting with all of the members of the fire crew present including the dispatcher. An overview of the new digital system was intensively gone over with the radio tech. All attendees were allowed to openly ask questions until all felt comfortable with the theoretical physical operations of the radio systems. A few days later an Rx burn was attempted and serious communication problems arose that potentially endangered the lives of the fire crew.

Problems that have been observed:

1. Using direct mode with physical line of site and everyone on the correct channel, radio communications broke down. People could hear one another only intermittently or not at all seemingly dependant on which direction the radio user was facing, and for other unknown reasons.

2. Intermittent communications with dispatch-other issues but no more space...","Unknown at this time since this is a completely new radio system as aforementioned.

Suggestion - Research radio needs and projected usage (fire ground ops) for ALL radio environments before implementation of system.

BASIC LCES - ***CRITICAL*** To have clear communications between members of the fire crew and dispatch.    Radio issues were discussed throughout the day and during a post burn AAR. The issue was brought up the next day during the morning briefing and later with the FMO and the head of the Refuge.

The cause of these problems has, at this time, not been determined but corrective action is being attempted.","01/23/2006 00:00"

Because it is a volunteer department and they were short handed they attempted to respond with one FFT2 and 2 totally untrained personnel until they were turned around by an individual from the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, Sasabe, AZ because there was no fire. This is the third or fourth call in two months that the volunteer fire department has attempted to send a 'crew' of untrained personnel to a potential or actively burning fire. On November 27, 2005 an individual responded ALONE to a wildfire being controlled by the Buenos Aires in a Type 6 brush truck in blue jeans and sneakers, no training, no fire shelter, no PPE. Even after being told that the Buenos Aires did not need assistance on the 11/27/2005 fire the individual still continued in to the scene even and stayed until the Buenos Aires attained 100% control of the fire even though he himself has no fire training and did not have proper PPE. Another individual of the  Volunteer Fire Department who is trained in both Wildland and is an AZ state certified Firefighter I&II has told him all state and federal rules must be followed and that the Volunteer Fire cannot send these untrained, unprepared individuals out on calls.  The individual in question will not listen.","Someone needs to inform the individual from the Volunteer Fire Department that his personnel must be properly trained and properly outfitted to respond to and fight a wildland or any other type of fire. His own personnel and neighboring agencies attempting to tell him that the Type 6 truck or any other firefighting vehicle must be sent to a fire with an Engine Boss and properly trained and outfitted personnel is not working. He has also been told by neighboring fire agencies that the rules were put into place for a reason and that safety of his personnel should be first and foremost. He isn't listening to his trained personnel, nor is he listening to us agencies that have mutual aid agreements that he is not following the rules and is putting his personnel and us agencies that are providing personnel as part of our Mutual Aid agreement at risk of possible death or at the least serious injuries by allowing untrained and not properly equipped personnel to respond on fire calls.    As a concerned member of a neighboring dept our Chief and Assistant Chief have attempted to contact the individual about our concerns. I feel that if someone from a federal agency contacted him it might hold more weight and he might be more apt to listen. We are familiar with their personnel and even call some of the Volunteer Fire personnel our friends and do not want to attend their funerals because this individual will not listen to anyone and continues to allow untrained, ill equipped personnel respond on fires.

This specific server is the main link to all internet and connectivity for the Supervisors Office. The particular server is also the main link for the communication system for the north zone communication repeater. Dispatch had no means of talking to any fire personnel on the Dry Hollow Fire. <br/><br/>The Monongahela NF SO is a building operated by USDA since this location is the COOP location for when Washington DC is evacuated due to unforeseen reasons. In May of 2018, a COOP exercise occurred in which the communication link for the repeaters were unplugged until the COOP exercise was completed. It was at this time we as a fire program knew there was a problem. At this time we were still monitoring active prescribed fires since they were not called out, we were able to work around not having proper radio coverage through cell service and local front desk personnel.<br/><br/>Due to budget reasons the issue could not be addressed in FY18.<br/><br/>A ticket was initiated with CIO to move the communication server link to another Forest Service owned site in which the USDA is not located. <br/>This ticket was submitted Oct 28, 2018. Contact was made during December to discuss cost and what was needed. Late Dec the government furlough occurred which backed up the CIO system. June deadline passed to purchase equipment and had to wait until FY20 for work to be started. Work has started in Oct and Nov. However the work is not complete. <br/><br/>When this link is not working there is no communication through an IP address which means dispatch cannot talk to field units. While on a active wildfire, firefighters are at risk and to minimize that risk we try to mitigate the dangerous situations. No communication with dispatch is a serious concern.<br/><br/>Fortunately we were able to have a RADO with phone service provide the critical link with dispatch. My concern is the delay in a response if a medical would occur. The main reason this Safe Net is being filed.","The Dry Hollow Fire has a Type 3 Incident Command Team. Included in the team is a Communications Unit which is the Forest Service's, Monongahela NF local radio technician. This individual manages the Forest Radio system and is very familiar with it's operation. The radio tech immediately started to trouble shoot the problem of the system.<br/> <br/>While trouble shooting was occurring, the ICP set up a RADO, started tracking and taking all radio communications to  mitigate the no communication link with dispatch. Good cell service communication did exist with dispatch.<br/><br/>In the diagnostic of the link problem, it was determined the issue was in the SO and with the USDA server on Nov 30, 2019. USDA was aware of a failure at 1600 the day before. <br/><br/>The radio technician called the USDA technician and USDA did not find the need to fix the problem until the following work week due to this being Thanksgiving Holiday weekend. Putting fire fighters at risk.<br/><br/>Discussion went into the need to fix the server and to do a reboot by USDA and finally the right folks were able to make the fix happen. <br/><br/>It is imperative the communication link of the repeaters for the forest be relocated to a site which eliminates the jurisdictions/access issues that have occurred with USDA.","12/03/2019 10:56"

Since the conversion to the USFS network, we have had several radio issues that are continually impacting our day-to-day workload to communicate with field-going employees for saw projects and prescribed fire activity.<br/><br/>The radio issues that we have been experiencing are as follows:<br/><br/>1)	The USFS radio desktops timeout (of logoff) from inactivity. This is a critical issue, as our field-going employees call us on the phone to confirm radio transmissions, when in fact dispatch has not received any audio. When we log back into the radio desktops, they may stay on all day, but in most instances, we must continue to log in when we notice that have gone to sleep. This has impacted our daily operations and communications.<br/><br/>2)	The Telex Unselected Audio does not come through the radio speakers except for the radio that sits at our Aircraft desk. The radios will only transmit the selected repeater through the speakers. We monitor 23 agency repeaters, 3 simplex channels, and Flight Following.<br/><br/>3)	Radio console located at extension 2915 is inoperable, because the USFS login does not work.<br/><br/>4)	Radio console located at extension 2917 still needs to be installed once a USFS license is issued. This console has been without a radio for numerous years.<br/><br/>5)	USFS network requires radio desktops to be restarted for updates. These computers should not require software updates as they are radios.<br/><br/>6)	BLM employees are unable to submit USFS Help Desk Tickets for the USFS RoIP equipment, so our only contact is USFS radio technician William Jonke, who is in Billings, Montana.<br/><br/>Please know that our only Montana/Dakotas BLM radio technician, Bob Hoffman, is doing his best, but he cannot service the entire state of Montana by himself.<br/><br/><br/>Our 2019 National Preparedness Review findings addressed many other radio issues, but these issues have surfaced since that review in June 2019.<br/><br/>This is a CRITICAL issue going into fire season and for the various prescribed burns that are occurring this week.

A Task Force arrived on scene, to find a Brush Truck and other units inside Martinez Torrez Dump Site on the North edge of the fire, approx. 50 feet away from the burning material.  The Brush Truck established IC on this incident, and per documentation in the computer notes, verified that hazardous materials were actively burning, with various colors of smoke and flames visible.  Request from AQMD was established but denied due to being on another fire.  No local hazmat team was attached or dispatched once it was confirmed that hazardous materials were actively burning on a 5+ acre dump fire. <br/><br/>     Once arrived the Water Tender Entered the Martinez Torrez Dump site looking for the ICP.  Once it was realized that the ICP was set up approximately 50 feet away from the burning material with engines staged on the perimeter of the fire, water tender immediately notified the Engine that they were leaving the scene of the fire to stage away from the smoke and away from perimeter of the fire. Water tender staged and established a plan for water shuttle operations at Las Palmitas Elementary School in Thermal CA. IC then contacted Water Tender on Tac channel requesting for them to enter the dump site to the south end of the fire to fill engines with water.  Water Tender refused direct orders on Tac citing Health and Safety concerns of toxic smoke due to hazardous materials burning in the dump site.  Water Tender also gave an alternative plan of having water shuttle operations set up at Las Palmitas Elementary School the location where they were located. IC then made face to face contact with the Engine regarding Water Tender’s situation.  IC requested the Engine to have the Water Tender come into the dump site as he planned, Engine personnel reiterated that Water Tender's operator will not be coming back into the dump site.  IC then released the Task Force from the fire to go to feeding and then return to quarters at station.<br/>There are several safety issues to note with this incident:<br/>1.	 Previous Directive has been given and is supposed to be implemented for fire department personnel to take action on dump fires that are burning hazardous materials and treat them as an active hazmat. <br/>2.	After Health and Safety concerns were established and a refusal of an order was initiated, operations continued by the IC and he willfully and knowingly exposed firefighters to dangerous hazardous conditions without due regard for their safety.<br/>3.	After establishing that hazardous materials were actively burning, local hazmat team was not immediately dispatched or attached to the incident, and no air monitoring was going on as firefighters were on the dump site being exposed to confirmed hazardous materials.<br/>4.	Water Tender was not equipped with its own SCBA.  Once separated from the Engine, the Water Tender had no way on having full respiratory protection. Also, there is no compartment or setup to adequately store a SCBA safely, which is imperative because a water tender generally only responds to fires of various types.<br/>5.	On November 28, 2017 Local 2881 Union Officials notified Cal Fire Riverside Unit of continued concerns of operations and directives and the need for firefighter safety to be addressed, with OSHA citing the department for several violations. It’s become evident that the department and managers are operating in a way that is willfully and purposefully harmful to firefighters safety.<br/><br/>I have pictures, video documentation, OSHA reports from previous violations,  the Fire Chief directive on these types of fires, and other supporting documents if needed.","1.  I immediately notified my engine company and other engine companies near me that I felt we were too close to this fire and didn't feel comfortable with my location near the toxic smoke.<br/><br/>2. I immediately removed myself from the perimeter of the fire, staged off a road downwind from the smoke coming from the fire, and then made my way to Las Palmitas Elementary School were I staged out of the area of the fire and toxic smoke.<br/><br/>3. Once requested to come back into the fire location, I refused the assignment from Incident Commander on the TAC channel specifically siting Health and Safety Concerns from the toxic smoke and it being hazardous. <br/><br/>4. I gave an alternative plan for Water  Operations located at Las Palmitas Elementary School in order for crews to stay out of the smoke.","10/24/2019 08:54"

I worked on networking throughout the summer and because of some miscommunications, the situation went from 'we'll play it by ear' up to 8/12 to a big urgent deal on 8/14.  Dispatch was asked to build a request for an ENGB (t) or FFT1 and one FFT2.  DO told me to handle this, but I later learned that he was also handling it and we were working against each other.<br/><br/>In my communication with a CRWB of potential personnel, I explained that I want to support his crew but am more concerned about safety and the ability to mentor and teach.  When he said he only has really green rookies, I explained that under the current circumstances - mid august fire behavior, 3 person engine crew (with me as the only person with any engine experience and required to drive) poor communication ability with those outside of the cab, and persistent vehicle issues, to name a few - I do not feel safe having two rookies without help from a more experienced engine person.  He agreed his priority is the safety of and positive experience for his guys.  <br/><br/>It came to my attention that one of the people I had been networking with tried to send someone (ENOP t) and was told 'we have it covered in house'.  This is when I learned the DO was also involved, so I asked why he canceled the order, 'it will just be too much of a pain to go to the airport to pick up one guy'.  He then told me I would take what I was given and make it work, 'we do this all the time'.  I expressed to my leadership and DO at least 5 times each that I do not feel comfortable with this situation, and used the risk refusal protocol to offer workable alternatives.  In response to all of my pleas, I was belittled and berated verbally and in email.  <br/><br/>I understand that policy does not have any issues with 2 rookies on a 3 person engine.  I worked the entire season with two guys with very little experience and we spent all season doing training and drills, but I do not feel comfortable bringing two brand new guys in the middle of August when fire behavior could be really dangerous paired with poor communication and unreliable equipment.  Even my outgoing seasonal students think it is dangerous.<br/><br/>High Reliability Organizations are meant to hear the concerns of employees at all levels.  Not one person in my chain of command took my safety concern seriously nor did anyone try to understand the reasons for my concern.  Instead I got 'this is not a safety issue, it is a leadership issue.'  Lessons Learned (mine and others in wildfire) has taught me to listen to that feeling of unrest.  There is a big difference between being mentored through something that doesn't feel right and being forced into doing it with no support.","I offered solutions that would make me feel safe: trade one qualified/experienced guy from another engine on the district OR fill the orders as requested, so I can have an additional driver or mentor.","08/22/2019 08:46"

In order to fell it on my intended lay a 15-20'x 10' green and healthy Lodge Pole tree would need to be felled in the same lay as the hazard tree.  The main factors on my mind regarding the smaller Lodge Pole was this, the lean was slighting opposite of the lay, minor limb entanglement, and very little room for error due to the 10' DBH (Diameter at Breast Height).  I had good escape routes and chose to place my cuts closer to the ground to gain more leverage.  <br/><br/>   I made it known I was starting to cut. I had road and trail guards in place.  I took out a small undercut to allow plenty of room for wedging and made sure it was gunned correctly. I shut off my saw and I yelled 'back cut'. I then restarted my saw and cut a couple inches into my back cut, then re-positioned so that I could bore through the heart to allow room for the 8' rifled wedge to be pounded through.  In the boring cut I pivoted the saw side to side about 1' to either side to make adequate room for the wedge and my saw so that I could avoid cutting the wedge and avoid kickback with the tip of the saw during the final quarter cuts.  I inserted the wedge and set it to where it was solid and secure. The tree stood up some with the placement of the wedge. I quarter cut my off side (bumping the wedge with the tip of my bar causing minor kickback) leaving adequate hinge wood and then proceeded to set the wedge deeper.  The tree stood up more and was now committed to the lay that I had predetermined, all was going according to plan.  I began cutting my last quarter and bumped the wedge with the tip of my bar causing minor kick back, I re-positioned and again hit the wedge this time at near full chain speed causing a violent kickback which caused the bar to jerk rearward and ran the top of my bar into my chaps just below my left knee. I Realized what happened, that I had cut my chaps. I did a self assessment to make sure that I was not injured.  after I established that I was not hurt, I put on another set of chaps and proceeded to finish felling the tree.  After completing my onside cut the strong fibers remaining on the hinge held the tree up but with two hits on the wedge it fell to my intended lay.  <br/><br/>   My supervisor was near by watching, and I informed him exactly of what and how it happened.  We discussed the event and it was decided that we would return a later date to finish the hazard trees in the camp ground.","The corrections I will make is better tip control, and gripping the handle on top of the power head rather than the side given that there is little kickback control while gripping the side handles, in this particular situation I would have had to take a knee in order to have proper control if gripping the saw on the top of the power head.  Another alternative would have been to place my cuts higher to allow a more secure and kickback resistant grip on the top of the power head.","08/07/2019 09:03"

Their terrain is a high mountain desert plain, with lava rock, sagebrush and grass fuels.  Multiple Idaho National Laboratory Fire Department (INLFD) resources, BLM fire resources and several fixed wing fire aircraft responded to initial attack this incident.  Fire behavior was very active and erratic, and initial attack resources worked throughout the evening into the next morning.<br/><br/>On the morning of 07/23/2019, the air to ground channel was changed from air to ground 49 to air to ground 2, which is common practice for a multiple day incident for the BLM.  The INLFD resources, that only utilize Harris radios, did not have the new air to ground 2 frequencies programmed into their Harris portable or mobile radios.  To accomplish programming these Harris radios, INLFD adds these frequencies over the air instead of each firefighter manually programming or cloning their portable and mobile radios.  On the morning of 07/23/2019, the INLFD began to change their frequencies on the Harris radios via over the air.  At this time, the fire behavior had increased and multiple agencies, including forest service and surrounding local fire departments were now responding and supporting this incident.  Sheep fire resources continued suppression operations and also began burning operations which continued throughout the day and night and into the next day, 07/24/2019.   <br/><br/>The INLFD Harris radios did not have the frequencies programmed for the new air to ground 2 from the morning of 07/23/2019 until the evening around 17-1730 on the same day.  This is roughly 8 hours where INLFD resources could not communicate directly with air attack or other air resources.  This included multiple INLFD dozers and INLFD brush trucks that did not have communications with any air resources because of this over air programming for the radios took 8 hours.  <br/><br/>Some of these INLFD resources, specifically, Brush trucks 401 and 404 were involved in burning operations from around 0900 until 2330 on the whiskey division.  Division supervisor whiskey also did not have direct communications with air attack or other air resources until mid day when he acquired a Bendix King (BK) radio in addition to his Harris radio.  <br/><br/>Even though the INLFD Harris radios were to programmed with the receive and transmit frequencies of zone 1 tac 1 that the BLM uses for their tactical channel, the INLFD Harris radios did not have clear or sometimes any communications with the BK radios.  The INLFD Harris radio could be right next to a BK radio and could not receive a BK's transmission message.  Because of this, the INLFD resources had to exchange phone numbers with other agency resources or be paired up to work in tandem with other resources to communicate.  Division supervisor whiskey with a BK radio would pick up transmissions from other BK radios on the same division or different divisions, and the same transmission would never be picked up by the mobile or portable INLFD Harris radio that was right next to the BK radio either being held by division supervisor whiskey or by an INLFD firefighter.  <br/><br/>The Harris radios also cannot scan between groups.  This posed a problem for INLFD resources, because, INLFD resources communicated on Command 3 for this incident which was in group A and zone 1 tac 1 that the BLM established as the communication channel for the sheep fire was in group B on the Harris radio.  So, multiple Harris radios had to be on different channels in order to receive or transmit communication for the INLFD.  In addition, INLFD Harris radios were the only radios that could receive and transmit INLFD's Command 3.  The other supporting agencies that were not paired up or did not have access to the INLFD Harris radios could not communicate by receiving or transmitting this channel.","INLFD incident commander was in unified command with the BLM incident commander and were in the same vehicle together.  The INLFD incident commander was in direct communications with INLFD resources with Harris radios and was also in contact with the BLM incident commander while in the same vehicle.  <br/><br/>Division supervisor whiskey, who was an INL firefighter, did have a BK radio and a Harris radio but this was not until the afternoon when he was given a BK radio.  <br/><br/>Phone numbers were also exchanged between INLFD resources and other agencies to communicate with one another, which is not a preferred method for fire operations.","08/07/2019 13:53"

The primary radio communication links between BLM fire personnel and Pueblo Interagency Dispatch for this incident were the BLM Twin base station and the FS Twin repeater, which both reside on Twin Mountain, which is located approximately 6 miles northwest of Canon City.  On July 10, 2019, radio maintenance personnel with the State of Colorado went to the Twin Mountain radio tower site to conduct state system radio maintenance.  As it was explained to me following the incident, this radio system maintenance was to replace the radio microwave link and antennas.  This scheduled maintenance was unknown to Canyonlands fire personnel.  When the state radio maintenance personnel removed the radio microwave link, the BLM Front Range Fire radio system link to Pueblo Interagency Dispatch was lost.  Additionally, the state radio personnel then inadvertently turned off the FS Twin repeater, removing the primary communication links between the Canyonlands Fire and Pueblo Interagency Dispatch.  This loss of communication with dispatch resulted in the disengagement from the fire of all Canyonlands ground personnel.  The FS Twin repeater remained off for over an hour before it was discovered what had happened.  The BLM radio network did not become operational again until the afternoon of July 11.","Because of the location of the fire, another FS repeater was able to be utilized in order to regain communications with dispatch.

The feedback issues prevented OVCC's 'Moducom' Radio consoles from transmitting and receiving over the South Forest Net. The feedback issues ranged from a day to roughly ten minutes in duration.  Per our Forest Radio Technician the issue appears to be related to our 'Moducom' Radio Consoles and how they communicate back to the equipment in our Radio room.  Each time the issue came up, announcements were made and a mass text was sent out directing the field resources to switch over to our backup radio system 'Service Net'.  On 07/07/19 the feedback issue arose several times throughout the day prompting the Fire District Duty Officers (based on Safety) to discontinue the use of the South Forest Net until the issue was resolved. Although we have our Service Net as a backup system the coverage is limited when compared with the coverage we get with the South Forest Net.  This limited coverage could pose a serious safety problem if/when a Fire/Natural Disaster or a significant Law Enforcement event were to occur in an area that the backup system does not cover.  The broader potential issue lies with the aging 'Moducom' based consoles within the Dispatch center.

LE could not access the point where the individual was and was on able to communicate with the team in the area; however they were able to make face-to-face contact with the assessment team and utilizing that team were able to remove debris from the roadways to make access to the individual. this situation was resolved with little to no issues however the possibilities are endless of the dangerous to the assessment team. once again we were lucky, we are constantly asking our people to go out and make public contacts, respond to emergency incidence of all hazards with lack of communication. The basics for all of are operations is LCES and we are lacking the 'C' it is only a matter of time before we are not lucky.<br/><br/>INCIDENT TWO:<br/><br/>  The following is a synopsis of the issues I ran into during prescribed fire operations on 3/6/2019 and a storm damage assessment operation on 3/15/2019. <br/><br/>Immediately after departing the fire cache with the Engine, I noticed a communications issue.  I called dispatch on the Golden Pond repeater to notify that we were en-route and their acknowledgement was very garbled and unreadable.  After arriving at the burn, I noticed the same problem talking with other resources on the unit before firing operations began.  The firing boss was communicating with the RXB2 on the same repeater and again the radio traffic was very garbled and mostly unreadable.  Within 30 minutes of the commencement of firing activities, I as the holding boss, attempted to call one of my holding resources on our tac channel.  Despite being less than a half-mile away, they were unable to hear me calling them after multiple attempts.  When I eventually tied in with that resource, we did a radio check and it was determined that neither radio was hearing the other, though there was some static heard while keying-up.  It was decided that I would clone their radios directly off of mine to hopefully solve the problem.  After cloning the radio and confirming we were both on the same digital tac, we continued to have problems throughout the rest of the day.  Another resource from the pacific northwest was also among the holding group and was also having similar problems on both the repeater and tac channel.  One of them made the comment “we thought our communications out west were bad”, referring to the very poor communications on our unit compared to theirs in Washington.  The problems continued throughout the day with numerous resources on the burn. <br/>Similarly during the storm damage assessment on 3/15/2019, the same problems were noted on the repeater channel when talking to dispatch.  When calling en-route to the assessment area, dispatch was very garbled on the Golden Pond repeater, even though I was only about a mile from it.  After a few attempts I finally called dispatch by phone to provide them the message.  They stated that they did not have problems hearing us, but the resources here were having problems hearing them. <br/><br/>Please let me know if you need any additional information. <br/><br/>INCCIDENT THREE<br/><br/>We can’t gain access to the Model repeater building to resolve the broken repeater.<br/>We had a problem with the WKMS repeater not functioning correctly and it needed a check. <br/>We can’t talk well, sometimes never, on a handheld across the unit with any certainty. <br/>We have to rely on mobile (truck) radios but many times we don’t work next to or in a truck.<br/>Every coordinated response on this unit I have participated in over the last 60 days (one prescribed fire and one road/storm issue) our radio network has failed to function as needed. <br/><br/>  No one I have spoken to here relies on the radio network here. They all have work arounds. That’s a big problem.  (It was the exact same case in both of my previous assignments-no one trusted the system.) I am truly not calling attention to the problem to stir things up but this is a safety issue. We ask our people to respond to things daily that have the potential to become big incidents. Most times they do not. But when they do, we need a radio system that works to support our employees and gives reliable communication. <br/>It will take time and commitment, and possibly funding, to resolve this issue but once we find the problem(s) and resolve them. It will all be worth it. <br/> <br/><br/>  Three different field going personal with three separate incidents were we got lucky and no one was hurt or killed and no damage to property. we can not keep relying on luck to get us through these incidents.","As always we used cell phones with spotty service.

Many other federal agencies (AFS, NPS) in the state of Alaska are issued the appropriate radios. We are given one ALMR capable radio for the entire engine; however, due to lack of support at the agency level, the radio is not programmed or maintained by our radio shop, due to lack of support on the Forest Service level, to actually be functional on the ALMR system. We were unaware our one radio was taken off the system entirely, so we found out we would be entirely unable to communicate to fulfill our assigned task of providing initial attack support for the host agency. This was also a major issue while this fire was under the Type 3 team, as they were also utilizing ALMR radio system for the incident.

After watching the fire for roughly half an hour, the soon to be IC of the incident made the decision to hike into this fire, identifying that it was roughly 3-4 miles worth of a hike. IC grabbed two firefighters from the first responding engine and began the hike in. Both fire fighters were instructed to bring a few extra water bottles and a space blanket for overnight gear. As they progressed their hike the first respondig engine identified a possible road to make access to the fire on. After getting the ok from the IC they rendezvoused with other responding resources and then began to make their way to the newly identified road. While en route on the new road, the convoy of engines and crew trucks ran into large washed out sections and what appeared to be a swollen creek that seemed as though they couldn’t safely cross. It was beginning to get dark when the crews pulled back to an overlook area from which they could see the fire. The IC finally arrived on his fire, and through communications it appeared as though he had gone ahead of his two assigned firefighters who were now becoming lost as they tried to make entry to the fire. In the meantime, the engine leads and assistants came together to work on a game plan with the fire as it’s limited access presented a problem of res supplying the firefighters who had hiked in. Once the two lost firefighters arrived on scene they were asked the status of their water, and what was passed to the crew of engines was that on the fire scene the three of them only had four quarts of water split between them for the night. The IC then asked if the engine crews could have their two most in shape firefighters hike in the same way with five gallon water containers. The request was denied as the hike would be too dangerous in the dark. After conferring with the duty officer, the engine crews decided on a plan to have three firefighters hike in more water in the morning while the other engines retrieved a UTV and tried to make entry on the more hazardous roads. Crews assigned to the fire had been informed that they would most likely not be receiving any other resource aid in this incident. <br/>On the morning of June 1st, the second day of the fire, the three selected firefighters began their hike to ressuply the IC and his crew at the fire. Before hiking in, they determined that the hike was not 3-4 miles, but much closer to 6 miles straight line distance. The hiking crew continued in as the UTV began to progress slowly closer to the fire. At roughly 1100, a jumper plane made it to the fire bringing six jumpers plus extra paracargo to ressuply the IC and his crew. At the same moment, the UTV made access and drove right to the fires edge. At this time the hiking crew radioed in that they were at a point designated by the IC for a creek crossing roughly 2 miles from the start of their hiking area. IC couched them to the crossing point, and the hiking crew continued. By the end of their hike, they would claim the distance had actually been roughly 10-12 miles if counting hiking up creeks to cross them. At no point were the hiking crew given an order or suggestion to halt the hike and make access through vehicle leading them to completing the long hike.","Concerns with the IC’s decisions were discussed amongst engine/crew leads and with the IC to identify concerns. Concerns were the lack of foresight for hiking in such a long distance with obvious problems for ressuply, as well as the lack of thought for turning back the day 2 hiking crew once paracargo and jumpers had been delivered. The values risked seemed to far outweigh any potential gains from the IC’s course of action.","06/24/2019 19:30"

I was informed of this incident the next morning by a concerned employee.  I spoke to 4 people including the employee involved about the incident and feel that this must be reported.  <br/>The relief lookout was heading to the L.O. in a POV at approx 0830.  She carries with her food, water, and a cell phone in case of emergency.  Part way up the mountain she blew a tire and she had no lug wrench.  She thought about trying to get to the lookout on a flat tire, but it proved too difficult and it was too far to walk.  She attempted to use her cellphone but found that she had no signal.  Assuming that protocols would be followed when she missed her check-in time she decided to sit and wait for assistance either from a passerby or from F.S. employees she expected to be sent to find her.  She sat by her vehicle for roughly 8 and a half hours, waiting. <br/>Obviously steps were missed here concerning safety protocol for lookouts and/or personnel who either fail to or are unable to check-in.  Daily, the lookout checks in with dispatch, who gets a daily staffing report the night before, when they go in service.  Around 1000 there is a Lookout check done, by dispatch.  Around 1300 there is another check in after the weather and again later in the afternoon.  Dispatch failed completely in initiating safety checks on the lookout when she failed to respond via the radio after at least 4 different check in times.  <br/>I feel that the lookout's supervisor, dispatch, and the Duty Officer (D.O.) failed in identifying that an employee had missed multiple check-ins.  It wasn't until 1600 after a call from the employee's daughter that a single fire engine with crew was sent to look for her, at which time the duty officer, the DFMO, delegated command to a suboordinate and went home for the day. The engine crew found the lookout at her vehicle around 1730. Luckily she was unhurt, though she was angry and saddened that no one had come to look for her earlier. The unit fuels officer was the first to bring up the missing employee to the DFMO, she also contacted dispatch and asked why no one had called the district when check-ins were missed.  She said that Dispatch told her they assumed that the daily staffing report was wrong and that no one manned the lookout that day.  This is in the middle of a busy fire season when we ALWAYS have a lookout staffed. This by the way is the second time something like this has happened to this employee. <br/>So many safety protocols were missed yesterday that I took the problem to the District Ranger and informed her that I was going to file a safecom and pursue remedies so that this will not happen again in the future.","I did nothing but report this as I had left work early for my son's birthday party.<br/><br/>However I have recommendations that I hope will fix this problem so that it does not happen again.<br/><br/>1. Assign the lookout and relief a hand held radio.<br/>2. Require them to check-in with dispatch, a supervisor, or the D.O. to let someone know when they are enroute to the Lookout.<br/>3. License the Lookouts and issue them a government vehicle so that they will have dependable transportation.<br/>4. When a check-in is missed follow established protocol for initiating a search for a missing employee.  This is supposed to begin with a phone call, radio communication, with the employee, the D.O., and the employee's supervisor.  If no communication can be established a search for the employee must be initiated and those in charge MUST not 'GO HOME' while this is happening.","09/20/2013 16:18"

(It should be noted that the Flight Nurse suggested taking the IP to a burn center, not identified in the 206. Flight Nurse stated there was a 'better burn center' to the Line Medic, but the decision was made to follow the 206).  Once in the ER, the IP was seen immediately and assessed by several medical personnel.  At approximately 1440, a representative from the USFS arrived and identified herself as an 'Agency Representative'.  The IP was kept in the ER for approximately five hours. Once relocated to a room, hospital personnel thoroughly scrubbed the burn area and applied sterile dressings covering the burns. Prior to the scrubbing, the IP told the Agency Representative that she could go home. Once the burns were scrubbed the IP had to ask if he could get cleaned up since he was still in the Nomex that he was wearing when he was burned. Hospital personnel provided a basin of water and sterile wipes, but did not assist. Since the IP was heavily medicated this was extremely challenging. <br/><br/>IP was seen by a Doctor on Sunday September 8 who advised that he wanted the IP to be seen by a surgeon due to the severity of burn. The IP was told that an appointment was set up for him in Denver for Wednesday September 11th. The IP wanted to verify the appointment and was given contact information for a burn center in Denver.  IP phoned the number, but the burn center was already closed. On Sunday afternoon at approximately 1430, IP's ENGB arrived at the hospital. IP phoned the Denver burn center again on Monday morning and was told that no appointment had been scheduled.  IP then took the next available appointment which was Thursday September 12 at 1320.<br/><br/>On Monday September 9, the hospital advised the IP that he was stable enough to be released and travel back to Colorado. There was confusion regarding the IP's return arrangements. The Agency Representative told the IP that he would be flying home on an 'Air Tanker'. After numerous phone calls it was determined that IP would actually be flying back to Colorado on an Air Attack 'platform' out of the Fresno Tanker Base.<br/><br/>IP was released at 1100 on Tuesday September 10 and was taken to the Fresno Tanker Base by his ENGB.  Pilot and IP departed Fresno at 1545, due to weather they had to RON in Grand Junction. On Wednesday 9/11, the pilot determined that due to weather they would not be able to continue on to the final destination of Canon City.  Arrangements were made with the local BLM/USFS unit to transport the IP via road to Gunnison where he was met by the IP's agency personnel and driven to IP's home in Canon City. <br/><br/>Total travel time was 27 hours with 7% total burn area, 2% of which was third degree burns.","The nature of this situation has led to the following recommendations and need for protocol clarification:<br/><br/>1) IP's home agency has determined the need for clear guidance for these situations and in hind sight should have provided or insisted on immediate on site medical advocacy to be maintained from initial hospitalization to secure transport home.<br/><br/>2) It was unclear if the assigned IMT had protocol to provide trained medical advocacy for injured firefighters.  Furthermore there was confusion regarding the classification of the injured firefighter, Contractor vs. Cooperator.<br/><br/>3) Based on comments from the local flight nurse there may have been a superior Burn Center. Do IMT's have a protocol to research medical facilities for the 206?<br/><br/>4) Based on the location of the burn, the Scarpa boot construction may have contributed to the severity of the injury.","10/31/2013 11:14"

Often we are tasked with changing our tour of duty to meet the needs of the Incident. In this case we were asked to go to night operations and assist with burning and holding. 4 of the first 6 days we were to be off the clock, there were not enough sleeping trailers to house the crew for rest. Numerous days there were other crews that had spots in these trailers instead of the crews that were out all night actively engaged in suppression efforts. <br/>	Due to the length of the fire season this year, our crews immune system had already been fatigued. This coupled with only 2-3 hrs of sleep in 93 degree weather/ day and the amount of smoke inhaled by the crew(Poison Oak), led to 4 people being diagnosed with lung infections and 4 others that had come down with more than “Camp Crud”. <br/>	The Crew Boss had raised his concerns about the sleeping arrangements every day until he found a friend that was able to help reserve spots in the sleep trailers for the crew the last 2 shifts. If the incident needs a night shift, the IMT needs to make every effort to support the personnel that are utilized for that shift. If the logistical support is not there to facilitate a night shift, the plans for the fire should correlate with what the IMT can support. <br/>	Enough is Enough. At what cost do we stop to re-evaluate? 4 people with lung infections and 4 others sick from 1 otherwise healthy hard working crew. Our crew was able to demob and get the sick the rest they needed back home, but this should not be S.O.P. for Incidents.","The CRWB brought their situation up daily the DIVS and Safety.

The fire was very active and we were observing 5-8 foot flame lengths on that portion of the fire.  At that time we had 2 BLM type 4 engines, and 2 RFD engines supporting the burn.  Things were going well.  Then two Ranchers that hold a grazing permit in that area rode up on their ATVs.  They said they have cows out there and they need to go down the road to get to the other side of the fire.  I told them that fire activity on the road was too intense for people on ATVs to travel.  I told them that I understand that they need to check their cattle and possibly release them, but they need to wait a few minutes for our burn to work, or if you can't wait, you can go around the fire to the east since the winds and the fire activity are a lot less of a danger.  They said they would go around to the East.  2 minutes later they were on their four wheelers, out in the unburned fuel, in between our burnout and the active fire edge.  We held our burn operation, and we sent a firefighter to flag them down and get them to move out of there.  The ranchers quickly realized that they were in a bad spot.  They turned around and drove further down the flank and found an area of low intensity to cross over into the black.  This was a very close call.  In other parts of our District we have agreements with some RFPAs (Range Fire Protection Associations).  This has empowered the local ranchers to have some basic fire training, PPE, and Radios.  Over the past, season instances like this have been reduced in those areas, and they have been very helpful with fire suppression.  If there was an RFPA established in the Shoshone Field Office area, I feel there would be a reduction in the amount of close calls with the ranchers.","We stopped burning, and tried to get the Ranchers to a safer place.","09/03/2013 08:08"

I thought this was odd because at this point I had only constructed some pieces of indirect fireline and about 25 yards of hotline.  So I stopped to cool the machine off and looked at the codes in the computer which stated the engine coolant temp high and a fuel derate code.  Once the machine cooled down I started putting an indirect fireline up about a 30-40% slope to the top of the ridge with no issues.  Later I was pulled to the other side of the fire where there was some structures threatened and was engaged in some pretty intense fire behavior in brush.  A slop over started making a strong push toward the structures and I was able to get a line around it but right as I tied it back into the existing line I got another beep and stop light.  The gauge acted the same and pegged out instantly.  I stopped to let the machine cool down again and noticed the cab A/C had stopped working and was blowing warm/hot air into the cab.  Once the engine cooled down I finished out the shift with no other issues.  It is because of these type of issues that this machine has the potential to put the operator in an unsafe position and has shown its limited effectiveness compared to other similar types of equipment. out good.","Cleaned out radiator and changed air filter in hopes of preventing future overheating.

I came into this fire as an SOFR (T) and I was given a great opportunity to train under SOF2. During this assignment there were 8-10 flat tires all on rental vehicles, not one came from a Federal or State resource.  One vehicle had three flats over the six day period of the Type III organization.  My observation was that no vehicle was going too fast that this seemed to be a tire issue.  Most rentals even though 4X4 capable come with four ply tires and not the ten ply that is often used by both local and federal agencies who fight fire regularly in the West, where roads are rugged and indeed tire killers.  <br/><br/>The roads on the State incident worsened by the day!  One road (Gardener Canyon) was closed by IC3T in a very good safety precaution.  While safety messages and briefings was emphasizing to slow down, yet still flats occurred.  This situation was discussed in the teams AAR on Thursday, August 22, 2013 with all concluding that flat tires were an issue on the State Fire.  Our observations and recommendations would be that individual picking up rental vehicle should attempt to get a vehicle with ten ply tires even if this costs significantly more.  When a person gets a flat with a rental they have a new experience with changing the tire on that rental, rentals often come with poor jack and lift systems that can collapse on uneven surfaces, which is often the case in wildland fires that is uneven surfaces.  Again we had no flats with federal vehicles, just rentals.<br/><br/>Besides trying to prevent poor jack systems from collapsing and hurting a person, we are also trying to prevent someone from getting a flat in a bad area when fire is approaching.  I only believe it is a matter of time when we see someone injured due to a poor rental jack, or someone is burned or even killed due to flat in the wrong area.  No we cannot prevent all flats, but if we required rental agencies to supply vehicles with ten ply tires we may prevent a major incident.","As mentioned above cautions were put in place by closing bad roads and slowing down, but still flats were occurring.  One suggestion we had in the AAR would be having rentals in bad/ washboardy road travel at a maximum of 25 MPH, compared to the standard 35 MPH.","09/09/2013 12:48"

Local VFD ordered BLM resources to help as fire continued to spread up drainage and over ridgelines to east.  Multiple local engines and 3 BLM engines and 1 BLM squad worked till approx 2130 to contain 75% of the fire with no loss to structures and no injuries.  After firing and dozer operations were completed the Operations was on a ATV GPSing as much of the fire as was accesible.  While GPSing the East most flank along the dozerline the fireline took off up a steep rocky slope that was not safe for ATV travel.  The operator returned back down the dozerline/fireline and found a more safer slope to the east that tied into a road overhead that would take him directly to the top of the ridgeline.  The slope was approx 25% slope and was covered in knee high grass and scattered sagebrush.  Once the operator came upon the upper 1/3 of the slope he noticed a small ledge and chose to turn sidehill to an opening to his right approx 20ft..  The placement of sagebrush and rocky terrain prevented a proper K-turn.  The operator proceded to sideslope to his right slowly with his right knee on the seat and left foot on left peg for more control.  While sidesloping to the opening the front left tire approached a small sagebrush and caused the ATV to start to tip over downhill.  The operator noticed the ATV was about to roll and pushed the ATV away from himself and landed on the uphill side of the ATV.  The ATV suffered damage due to rolling down the hill.  The operator was safely out of the way and did not suffer injuries.","Actions taken by operator were proper riding stance and anticipating a rollover on the terrain he was riding.

I arrived at 0800 and was briefed on the fires we had 'confirmed'. I was told the fire I was dispatched to would have the most fire activity out of all of the fires in the area and that it was the most concerning. I left the station with a squad at 0845 and arrived at our hike in point at 0930. I left the squad at the rigs and began my hike in. The hike in took about 20 minutes. Once at the fire I took a lap around the fire and assessed that there was a tree that was a hazard and needed to come down before we could engage the fire. At this time the fire was a quarter of an acre. I finish my walk around and give my size up to dispatch. In the size up I asked for additional resources; a C-Faller, and also told them that we would not be engaging the fire until the hazard tree was mitigated. At this point I begin my hike back to the rigs when I see smoke coming from further down the hill, I hiked down to find another fire. This fire was less than 1/10th of an acre, I give my size up on this fire and then finish my hike back to the rigs where I gather up my squad and hiked into the smaller fire since it did not have any hazards that needed to be mitigated before we could engage the fire. Around 1230 I receive a call on the radio saying we need to get off the hill and head back to station due to a thunder storm coming overhead with severe winds and hail. At this time we left the fire and headed back to station. The fire that we were working on had saw line and hand line 100% around it and I felt it was safe to leave. <br/><br/>We waited at the station till the storm passed and then headed back out to the fires, with another squad and a C faller. We arrive at our hike in point and myself with the C faller and swamper went into the initial fire to check the hazard tree. The C faller assesses the tree and made it clear that it was not safe to cut and was not going to cut the burned out tree. At this point we were talking about the tree and he was talking to me about why he turned it down and why it was not safe to cut. We were talking for about 2 minutes when I said 'isn't the crack in the back of the tree getting bigger'. At that time we heard the tree start to make a loud popping sound as the tree started to come down (the C faller and swamper were 5' directly behind where the tree fell and I was approximately 15' at about 1 o’clock from where the tree fell), We turned and ran, the faller and swamper made it behind a smaller 20 inch solid tree that was about 15 feet away and I made it behind another tree that wasn't far. <br/><br/>We took a few minutes to gather ourselves and then bucked the tree so it would not create a larger fire.

The fire was burning in 8 foot heavy brush in an old fire scared area, the duff was relativity  light and there were two snags burning interior, one was approximately 130 feet tall 30' DBH and severely compromised by fire in the center, the other was half a tree approximately 50 feet tall 20' DBH with fire all up and down it. A C faller and handcrew was ordered and Battalion who was in the area said if the crew didn't have a C faller he was qualified and willing to cut the tree, the handcrew was contacted and they said that they had a qualified faller on the crew.  Engine 35 pulled a 1 1/2 trunk lay up to the fire and started a hose lay around the left flank.  The crew was made aware of the snags and the decision was made to keep the crew off the right flank were the trees had a predominate lean until the trees were on the ground.  At around 1900 Tribal type 2 IA handcrew arrived at scene and was briefed by the IC trainee and was made aware of the no work zone due to the tree hazards.  The crew boss was the C faller and assured Battalion that he was comfortable in falling the hazard trees, the IC trainee and faller discussed options to put the trees down, it was determined to wait and let the top fall out of the 30' DBH tree and then fall the 20' tree rest of the 30' tree. About 1945 the top fell out of the 30' tree and the hose lay was advanced from the top of the fire down the right flank to the location of the 20' tree and the base was cooled off enough to work in the area the C faller then proceeded to cut the tree. The crews had been notified by the faller his intention was to fall the tree side hill and toward the left flank.  The faller then made a single kerf face cut and a sloping back cut without calling out the cuts, the crew was not given enough time to clear off the left flank before the tree tip over sideways and down the hill.  The IC trainee confronted the faller about falling the larger tree and how it would be done, the faller wanted to fall the tree uphill against its lean, the IC trainee told him to fall it downhill with the lean the Trainee also advised the faller to put a full face cut in and a flat back cut.  The IC trainee then advised the crews to move uphill and off the line to provide plenty of room for safety, before the cut was started. The IC trainee confirmed by radio that the crews were clear of the line and in a safe area.  The faller then proceeded to make a single back cut through the tree without a face cut and without calling out the cuts.  The tree tipped over downhill and left a large chunk of wood on the front side of the tree creating a reverse barber chair.  No injuries occurred and the IC was notified of the poor falling Technique.","Battalion discussed with the C faller that if he was uncomfortable about falling the tree he would come up and complete the falling operation. The faller was advised of the hazardous conditions, it was decided to let the top fall out of the tree before engaging the tree. The IC advised the faller on the appropriate technique and direction to fall the tree.  The IC advised crews of the plan and then confirmed their position before the faller started to cut.","08/20/2013 07:59"

I told him that since he was on the fireline and in the trees, he needed to have his hardhat on. He told me he was not assigned to the Butler Fire, but that he was on the Scott Valley Helitack Crew  assigned to Initial Attack on the Salmon River Complex. He said that they were working several intitial attack fires in the area. He hesitated putting on his hardhat so I picked it up and handed it to him. He said 'oh, you're serious, you want me to put it on right now.'<br/><br/>I asked him three questions: (1) Did you have an operational briefing? (2) Do you have an Incident Action Plan (IAP)? and (3) Do you have all the frequencies programmed into your radio? He responded that he did not have an operational briefing other than one from the Divisional Engine Crews. He also said he did not have an IAP. He said he had Air-to-Ground and Deck programmed into the radio and the other frequencies 'on my Ipad.' I told him that I was obligated to brief him since he did not get an operational briefing, and that he was obligated to program all the frequencies into the radio since he was on the fireline on the Butler Fire. He again stated that he was with the IA Module working a few fires. I again stated that he was on the fireline on the Butler Fire and required to comply with my requests.<br/><br/>I asked him about his LCES since he said he had been briefed by the Engine Crews in the area. He pointed out where the Engine Crews' lookout was. I told him that he was deficient in the Communications prong. He stated that the helicopter was both his Escape Route and Safety Zone. He said that the Engine Crews would brief him on those. I told him that they might not be around if reassigned or diverted elsewhere. I reminded him that he was a firefighter first and that it was his responsibility to comply with LCES. I asked him if he had ever studied the South Canyon and Cramer Fires and how those Helitack Crewmembers had relied on the helicopters and died. He said he was aware of those fires.<br/><br/>I had to leave to respond to a radio message. Approximately 30 minutes later, I heard him on the Air-to-Ground tactical channel calling his fellow Crewmembers. He told them he had just been 'chewed out by a Butler Safety Officer' for not having a briefing and not having the frequencies programmed into the radio. He also made up a completely false response that I had chastised him for 'being mor than 8' from his webgear.' I never said anything about his gear.","See above.<br/><br/>I also called the IMT Safety Officer on the telephone later that evening to relay this information.<br/><br/>This seems to be an ongoing safety infraction with many Helitack Crews and needs to be stopped based on several SAFENETS being filed over the years for the same issues.

The faller was cutting the green tree when the hung-up tree broke loose and fell right where he had been standing. The faller escaped but the saw was destroyed.  <br/><br/>Concern: A large tree leaning into a smaller tree at a 45 degree angle is a very high risk situation in which to attempt cutting the green tree.

After a few minutes of active fireline construction, the A/C quit and made the in cab environment uncomfortable.

Battery check was made and several experienced Hotshot overhead examined the radio and found it to be non-operational. The concern is that communications between the crew and the Incident overhead will be compromised at critical moments on the fire line. Last minute changes on personnel carrying radios had to be made which disrupts normal crew operations and limits firefighting capabilities such as small groups, lookouts, and communicating with adjoining forces and supervisors. The potential for other radios to stop working and further limit or stop communications on incidents is high. Our Hotshot crew has experience years of poor quality radio equipment that continues to make fighting fire difficult but this 2013 year has already produced five radios that could not be used because of some internal problem and not a result of some damaging accident. The service provided to maintain the radio is inadequate because the radios comeback still broken or the repair does not last. Also the process time it takes to get a radio fixed is too long at one to five months.The repairs should be made on the forest or the incident to shorten repair time and keep accountablity close to the local Forest. The radio loner program gives out sub-par radios that tend to become immediate communication problems that lead to safety issues. We have had 1 to 3 radios not working at one time for this short season. It is easy to think that most or all of the radios could stop working at the same time.","Last minute changes were made having less people carrying working radios.

The Honda pump was connected and started and was operating efficiently. The engine crew was monitoring the pump operation and water was flowing to the fold-a-tank smoothly. The pump operator started to prepare the Jerry can(old style similar to Mark III fuel can) for re-fueling as necessary. The cap was taken off of the Jerry can and the operator noticed that he didn't have a pour spout for the can. He returned to the engine to look for the pour spout and was unable to locate one. He returned to the pump and decided to check the fuel level of the pump tank. The pump fuel cap was removed while the pump was still running. It was then that the operator noticed that the pump was approximately half full. He again went to the engine to try to locate the pour spout. While he was returning to the pump location he heard the pump start to sputter and stall. He went to the pump to investigate why it had stopped. This is when he noticed that the gas cap had been left off. Within 10 seconds of pump stalling a fire started on/around the location of the pump on the air filter and exhaust side. As he approached the pump a flash fire occurred. While retreating from the burning pump, the Jerry can was knocked over and was approximately five feet to the burning pump away from the exhaust. The cap was still off of the Jerry can and the spilled fuel ignited near the pump site. <br/><br/>  The engine boss (ENGB) was notified of the fire and the type 6 engine pulled forward to the fire. They began suppressing the fire with the engine and quickly recognized to use the fire extinguisher from the engine. The fire was rapidly suppressed and contained to the immediate area of the pump. DIVS and DIVS(t) was notified and arrived on scene. He instructed the engine crew to 'dam up' around the spill site as there was no containment barrier in place for the pump operation.<br/><br/>  The line safety officer and resource advisor arrived on scene and were brifed on the situation.

Everything went very smoothly considering the situation and terrain, the individual was transported to a second hospital due to the severity of the medical situation this patient had heat exuaghstion with signs of heat stroke.

How much longer will the state be negligent to its employees and keep depending on luck to keep its firefighters alive? This district has Four EMT-B's including myself and none of them are able to perform lifesaving tasks due to the lack of medical gear. Luckily in this situation the stars aligned and the patient was saved.<br/><br/>From the way I am seeing things we are going to continue to do the same thing until someone dies. The blame of this death won’t come down to the EMT's or on any of the States Districts; it’ll come to those who were negligent in providing the proper funding to maintain fire fighter safety. Let me remind those about standard fire fighting order #10- Fight fire aggressively, HAVING PROVIDED FOR SAFTEY FIRST. I am an EMT and work for a city fire department in the winters and know what negligence looks like and this is a prime example.<br/><br/>We instill safety in these young firefighters to be safe on the fire line, but in the case like this where an incident happens give those who can save lives the tools they need to do so. No one wants to be the person that looks a father, a mother, wife, or husband that their loved one has passed away due to negligence that could have been prevented.

A Color Country District Fire Operations Specialist (FOS) arrived on scene at 1636 and tied in with the ICT4 and ICT4 trainee. The FOS estimated the fire at approximately 100 acres and spreading rapidly to the S/SE.<br/>At 1830 the Incident Complexity Analysis in the Color Country Incident Organizer was completed, and a Recon/GPS flight requested.  The following were checked “Yes” in the complexity analysis:<br/><br/>Fire Behavior<br/>•	Fuels extremely dry and susceptible to long-range spotting or you are currently experiencing extreme fire behavior.   (Juniper LFM is at 78%, which is near the historic low.)<br/>•	Weather forecast indicating no significant relief or worsening conditions.  (self-explanatory)<br/><br/>Firefighter Safety<br/>•	None<br/><br/>Organization<br/>•	Operations are at limit of span of control.   (self-explanatory)<br/>•	Variety of specialized operations, support personnel or equipment.   (On 7/3-7/4 there were 4 heavy air tankers, 4 SEATS, 2 Type 1 helicopters, 2 Type 3 helicopters, 2 Dozers, misc. ATGS, lead and ASM aircraft.)<br/>•	Limited local resources available for initial attack.   (self-explanatory)<br/>•	Heavy commitment of local resources to logistical support.  (with resources ordered on 7/2 we were going to be at approximately 150 people on 7/3, for 4-5 days) <br/><br/>Values to be Protected<br/>•	Unique natural resources, special-designation areas, critical municipal watershed, T & E species habitat, cultural value sites.  (Sage Grouse and Utah Prairie Dog habitat) <br/>•	Sensitive political concerns, media involvement, or controversial fire policy.  (July 4th holiday weekend AND this fire taking up a lot of local IA resources for the holiday) <br/><br/>*If you have checked “Yes” on 3 to 5 of the analysis boxes, consider requesting the next level of incident management support.  We have 8 checked. <br/><br/>During the recon/GPS flight the fire was mapped at approximately 750 acres with 0% containment and still running/torching/spotting through Pinyon/Juniper, grass and Sage.  Based on the completed complexity analysis, the intelligence gathered on the recon flight and conferring with the Duty Officer, the FOS requested that a Color Country IMT3 be ordered.  Transition was requested for the next morning (7/3) at 0600.   At 1931 Color Country Dispatch sent a text to (MOB) Coates Type 3 IMT to Black Mt.<br/><br/>Safety Concerns<br/><br/>At 1942 (12 minutes later) Color Country Dispatch sent a text to (Hold) Type 3 Team Order.  Don’t go yet.<br/><br/>At 2001 the FOS called the Duty Officer and asked about the text to hold the IMT3.  The Duty Officer said that the District Manager told him, “Cancel the team.  You’re not getting the team.” And that the District Manager questioned the Duty Officer’s and incident personnel’s motives for holiday pay and overtime; and that we could/should have it contained by morning.<br/><br/>At 2130 the fire is estimated to be 1000 acres and still active.  <br/> <br/>At 2235 the IMT3 was reMOB’d after the Area Manager for the Utah Forestry Fire and State Lands expressed his concerns to the District Manager.  Transition to the IMT3 was delayed for an operational period in which the fire made significant runs and grew to 4500+ acres.<br/><br/>At 2307 all personnel are back at ICP. The fire continued to be active throughout the night.<br/><br/>The Duty Officer and the FOS made the decision to order the IMT3 based on facts.  The indices, incident complexity analysis, observed fire behavior, values at risk, and fire situation by experienced on-scene fire supervisors, along with the Delegation of Authority in the Color Country Incident Organizer were all taken into account.  The lack of support and trust in the professional judgment from the District Manager for his fire program personnel is putting the safety of firefighters at risk by creating an environment of indecisiveness.  Additionally, the District Manager has a “policy” that firefighting personnel cannot conduct burnouts without his prior approval.  There were opportunities to safely burnout a road near the head of the fire on the evening of 7/2.   This most likely would have stopped the fire at approximately 1000 acres.  After the aforementioned issue with ordering the IMT3, fireline supervisors were not willing to burnout the road due to the fear of retribution.   I am also concerned about the morale of our personnel after this incident; which may affect their ability to stay focused on the task at hand and look out for each other with the majority of the season still ahead of us.","The FOS/ICT3 had the ICT4 trainee make contact with, and receive confirmation from line supervision to re-affirm that all personnel were in a safe location and not hesitate to disengage if they were concerned about fire behavior, tactics, and/or LCES.","07/16/2013 08:37"

As Division I had been requesting spot weather forecasts daily.  I had received 4 spot weather forecasts, from June 24th until June 27th.  On this particular day (or possibly the previous day) a new IMET had arrived and unbeknownst to me had informed communications she would no longer be issuing spot weather forecasts because she was placing her own incident forecast in the IAP.  June 28th was the first day we had received an incident weather forecast in our IAP, however her weather stated temps 98-105 w/ RH 10-15%.  The previous 4 days I had been getting temps in the 70's w/ RH's in the 20's & there was no significant changes forecasted in our weather on the fire.  Our fire was at 11,500 feet elevation & weather readings were significantly different than the nearest town, Montrose, which had been recording 100's for temps the past few days.  Judging by the IMETs weather in the IAP it was clear her forecast was for the area around Montrose, not the fire location.  <br/><br/>On the morning of June 28th I called in a spot weather.  Approximately a couple hours later I had yet to receive my spot weather which I thought was uncharacteristic and odd.  When I followed up with communications they informed me via IMET that they would not be giving out a spot weather because one was available in the IAP.  I informed communications that forecast was not representative of our location, that was unacceptable & to please give us today, tonight & tomorrow.  Long story short, we never received a spot weather for that day.  Numerous members of the team became involved & we did start receiving spot weather forecasts starting again June 29th.<br/><br/>Actual temps for IMETs predicted day of 98-105 temperature/10-15 RH were nothing close.<br/>At 0900 it was 64/23, it progressively became hotter until a high of 76 & low RH of 18 (1400)& working its way back to 71/23 at 1800.<br/><br/>I have never seen a spot weather forecast refused & here we were somewhat near the location of Storm King on a red flag day during unpredictable monsoonal weather conditions.  Additionally, 19 of our firefighters were killed a couple days later, possibly due to erratic weather conditions.<br/>   <br/>I hope this was a one time occurrence but you never know.  My concern is this IMET may end up on another fire & repeat this refusal of a spot weather forecast.","Myself plus all resources on my DIVS were spiked out so I personally could not address the IMET at camp.  To mitigate having no spot weather, crews were taking and broadcasting hourly weather readings.  This matter was discussed thoroughly with the other DIVS, planning ops & line ops.  They addressed the issue with the appropriate individuals back at ICP.  Additionally, I was told the issue was addressed by the IMET's supervisor (NWS/NOAA).","07/16/2013 16:13"

Tender Operator inquired in briefing about driving down to spike camp empty at the end of shift due to steep grade and length of grade which was 7% at 8 miles.  The tender does not utilize an brake air system or does not have a secondary mechanism such as transmission brake, or engine brake to help reduce down hill engine speed.  the truck full wieghs aprox. 32,000 pounds and empty aprox 19,000 pounds.  The safety concern was that the brakes could glaze while trying to maintain proper engine speed within manufactures specifications and could cause fatal injury to occupents of apparatus.  Task Force trainee told us he wanted us to travel down full, we told him we rather not due to the above concerns.  He later told us to try it one time and see how it went we repectfully refused the order as not critical to mission success and offered several other options to meet leaders intent including 1) spike out full at ski resort 2) drop our fold-a-tank dump our water and refill upon return 3) leave spike camp early in order to get on site and full prior to task force becoming operational on site.  We also asked the Task Force Leader to provide the order in writing so if we had an accident we would have documentation of the order and our refusal.  Aprox. 1900 Task Force told us there would be no need and we were taken off of the structure group assisgnment and moved to Division Alpha where our responsibility became dust abatement on a 1.25 mile stretch of road at spike camp.

Area MAC to review fire activity within the Rocky Mt. Area during PL-4 in June and July 2013.  Team Lead was Larry Sutton - USFS.  Others who served on the SAT were:  Mark Peck (MT DNRC), Andy Mitchell (NPS),  Conan Donnelly (BLM).<br/><br/>The Rocky Mt. Coordinating Group (RMCG) felt that the Continuity of Command issue was of significant importance to the Rocky Mt. Geographic Area.  It is an issue that we are committed to ensuring does not happen in the future.  This is an interagency issue and affects firefighters on the ground, the public, agency administrators and everyone in between.   RMCG's goal, again, is to avoid these types of 'continuity of command' issues in the future and by issuing this SAFENET, alert other Geographic Areas to these types of problems and eliminating situations where they are created.  <br/><br/>The following is excerpted from the SAT report to the Rocky Mountain Area MAC:<br/><br/><br/>1. Continuity of Command on the West Fork Fire<br/>Continuity of command during all stages of an emerging incident has often been mentioned in accident investigation reports. Lack of command continuity can lead to confusion regarding who is in charge, where to obtain critical information, and leader’s intent.<br/><br/>From start to finish, the West Fork Fire could be a case study in transfer of command as an incident escalates in complexity. A large number of variables conspired to make the management of this incident challenging, although in many respects these were not unusual or unprecedented in comparison to incidents that have occurred in other locations.<br/><br/>On June 5, lightning ignited several fires on the San Juan National Forest. The Wolf Creek Fire started near the Wolf Creek Pass Ski Area. With the ski area and its related high value resources immediately threatened by the Wolf Creek Fire, the West Fork Fire that started the same day was a lower priority. The West Fork Fire was in remote, inaccessible terrain in the Wilderness. The terrain is very steep, including some cliffs in the area, and the fuels were mostly continuous dead spruce with few natural safety zones.<br/><br/>For a couple of days, the West Fork Fire didn’t show any smoke, but it came back to life on June 13, reported at 10-15 acres probably due to local thunderstorm winds fanning the fire. A local Type 3 organization began managing the West Fork Fire, but experienced people on the San Juan National Forest knew that this was going to be a long duration fire. They also recognized early on that the West Fork Fire had the potential to spread onto the Rio Grande National Forest; calls were made between the two Forests on this topic.<br/><br/>In 2012, the Little Sand Fire burned in much the same conditions for a number of weeks, and a NIMO team effectively managed that incident to the satisfaction of the San Juan National Forest Supervisor. Given that prior experience, a fire scenario with many similarities to one the previous year invited the use of a NIMO team once again.<br/><br/>The San Juan National Forest ordered a NIMO team to manage the West Fork Fire on June 15. The NIMO team assimilated the Type 3 organization into its own. <br/><br/>The National Situation Report said about the West Fork Fire on June 15: “this will be the last report unless significant activity occurs” as fire size was reported to be 125 acres.<br/><br/>A couple of days later, significant activity seemed to be occurring. Fire size had jumped to over 1800 acres. But the West Fork Fire was still lower priority than other fires in the Rocky Mountain Area, most notably the Black Forest Fire which was burning near Colorado Springs and had already burned over 500 structures. <br/><br/>The next day, fire size on the West Fork Fire was reported to be over 2600 acres. The day after, over 3200 acres.<br/><br/>On June 20, the West Fork Fire had jumped to over 8375 acres with extreme fire behavior reported. In other words, in the past few days the fire had doubled in size, then doubled again. But within the Rocky Mountain Area, it actually was sinking lower on the priority list as new fires emerged elsewhere. The Forest Supervisor on the Rio Grande National Forest was assigned to the Lime Gulch Fire as Incident Commander with his Type 2 IMT.<br/><br/>On June 21, the West Fork Fire was reported at 18,000 acres, with evacuations and area closures now in effect. Still not the top priority in the geographic area, it had now doubled and doubled and doubled again in size just in the past few days.<br/><br/>On June 22, the West Fork Fire had made it to the top of the list – it was now the number one priority fire in the nation and its fire size was reported at 38,000 acres – yet another doubling in size from the previous day. This exponential fire growth involved the fire spotting across the Continental Divide onto the Rio Grande National Forest. At the same time, the Papoose Fire on the Rio Grande NF had picked up and was also making serious acreage gains.<br/><br/>This situation was a completely new ball game and a Type 1 IMT was ordered to manage the east side of the complex of fires.<br/><br/>It appears that this is the point in time where some of the decision making about how these fires would be managed became a bit muddled. There were several key decisions and actions that were contentious:<br/>¿ The decision to order a Type 1 IMT but put it under command of the NIMO team already in place on the West Fork Fire<br/>¿ The decision to commit an Area Command Team to Durango without a clear delegation saying that they would be in command of anything<br/>¿ The limited situation awareness on who was in command on the Papoose Fire that led to that fire not having a Forest Service presence for 12-18 hours<br/>Breaking each of these items down further may show some of the ways in which they were problematic.<br/><br/>Decision to order a Type 1 IMT and put it under command of a NIMO team. While this decision was agreed to at the time by all the players involved, apparently many individuals had serious reservations about whether or not this was going to work. Everyone the SAT interviewed made a statement to the effect, “we could have made it work.” But many also expressed the sentiment that while large fires and complexes have often been zoned and managed by multiple Type 1 IMTs (e.g., Las Conchas, New Mexico 2011), those situations had never involved one Type 1 IMT being in command of another. One individual said, “it’s not about egos, it’s about ICS!” Many individuals said they were not afraid to innovate, in fact they welcome innovation in fire management. However, many also questioned whether the right time to try a new innovation is while massive head fire is bearing down on a community and evacuations are being made.<br/><br/>Decision to commit an Area Command Team to Durango without placing it in command of anything. This decision was problematic in several ways. First, the ambiguity left all involved wondering, what exactly was Area Command there to do? There were some benefits to Area Command being in place gaining situation awareness before they actually did assume command. Yet placing the team in Durango made it look like the San Juan NF was the unit that might need an Area Command, when in reality it was now the tail of the fire. The Papoose and West Fork Fires were headed toward high value assets on the Rio Grande Forest, and ultimately that is where Area Command ended up assuming command. It may have been more prudent, if an Area Command Team was going to be activated, to have them at the Rocky Mountain Coordination Center or Regional Office of the Forest Service. This was actually done in Region 3 only a short time previous, and while that Area Command Team was in the Regional Office they provided much needed support and services.<br/><br/>Limited situation awareness on the Papoose Fire that led to it being unstaffed by Forest Service resources for a period of time. This situation may have arisen due to several factors. <br/><br/>First, there was miscommunication between Forest staff and the NIMO team, leaving each with a different impression of what was supposed to happen. The Forest staff thought they asked the NIMO team to “take” the fire, but the NIMO team thought they had been asked to “watch” the fire. As a consequence, resources weren’t assigned as the Papoose Fire made a run towards high value assets; local citizens were naturally outraged at the lack of an FS presence. <br/><br/>Second, at the time the Papoose Fire was making its run, the West Fork Fire was also making a spectacular move straight at the community of South Fork, which was evacuated. All eyes were on this impending disaster which naturally distracted attention from what the more remote Papoose Fire was doing. <br/><br/>Third, radio communications in the area of the Papoose Fire were spotty.<br/>What impact did all this have on safety issues? Helitack and engine crews relayed that there was confusion over team structure. They reported there were 4 ATGS in a 2 day period. An engine crew checked in with the NIMO Team but found they were working for the Type 1 team and had to pull off the line for 6 hours to go check in with somebody else. One IMT only had maps for their area of the fire, not the whole complex. Agency resources were asked to re-clone their radios four times in one day, according to a Task Force Leader on the West Fork Fire.<br/><br/>It is completely natural for there to be some confusion during an emerging incident or when a fire makes a spectacular downhill run towards a community in a bed of dead spruce. For that precise reason, confusion regarding command issues must be avoided. The incident command system has been designed, and people have been trained, for it to function in certain ways. While that system should not be set in stone and never changed, it may be that ad hoc changes to it during an extreme fire situation are not the best recipe for success.<br/><br/>A couple of other considerations involve the unprecedented fire behavior and the structure/size/capabilities of a NIMO team. First, the fire behavior observed on the West Fork Fire was incredible. FSPro runs in the early stages of the fire indicated areas with low probability for the fire to reach; these areas were consumed by the fire in short order. Wind was also a factor both in long range spotting and rapid fire spread downhill. So, this was no “ordinary” fire situation and it is a tribute to all involved that no structures burned and no firefighters were seriously injured.<br/><br/>It should also be remembered that NIMO teams, while Type 1 qualified, are short teams. If they are to expand along with the incident, they will always need additional overhead resources. In the past they have often ordered Type 2 IMTs to work under them, providing additional operational reach and management capability while at the same time helping the IMT2 learn and practice some concepts around risk management and strategic planning. This is likely a practice that should be continued. On the West Fork Fire, when it made its spectacular run across the Continental Divide and down towards South Fork at the same time the Papoose Fire was blowing up, it’s likely that NIMO’s operational reach and management capabilities were exceeded even with use of local resources. However, in such a situation, it is also likely that any IMTs operational reach and management capabilities may have been exceeded given the circumstances.<br/><br/>Perhaps the single biggest takeaway for the SAT in examining this issue was that nobody seemed to have the “God’s eye view” of this complex of fires as they emerged and rapidly changed. Local units naturally had their own perspective of what was happening and what should happen, as did the different entities managing the incident. It may be that the Regional Office should take a more active, real-time role in developing and displaying a “Common Operating Picture” in situations like this","The Rocky Mountain Coordinating Group arrived at a concensus decision on 7/8/13 during our 2013 MAC AAR to develop an interagency SAFENET with NO agency affiliation to address this Continuity of Command issue in our Geographic Area.  <br/><br/>We intend to commit ourselves as a group and agency by agency to avoid this particular problem in the future.   We will do this by ensuring that this report is reviewed by all agency executives, agency administrators, FMO's and other key leadership within our area.

At approximately 1500 hours on June 11, 2013 the fire transitioned from the local fire district responsibility to County and immediately to State responsibility, the ICT3 from the El Paso County Sheriffs Office became the ICT3 for the State of Colorado before the Type 1 Team (Harvey) assumed responsibility.<br/><br/>At approximately 0030 properties along Burgess Road which represent the South boundary of fire travel were being triaged in the area near Goodson Road which is approximately 8 miles from the point of origin and 8.5 miles from the established ICP of the Type 3 Group (no formal ICT3 exists in this region).  Properties at 10302 Burges Rd (large barn and mobile home on the leeward side of the barn), 10390 Burgess Rd. (hardened structure and multiple outbuildings with high degree of mitigation) it was determined that these locations could be protected due to the current fire behavior (backing, low flame lengths) with little torching of re-gen pine, Type 6 Engines were left at each residence and the remainder of the Task Force moved to 11810 Goodson Road (approximately 600 yards from the Burgess Road addresses)with Black Forest Chief (700) and Chief 500 who was functioning as TFL.  At 11810 Goodson a large dwelling and barn were found, both easily protected which resulted in a Type 3 Engine being positioned along with a Tender to support, a single Type 6 was available and a second Type 6 Engine was due to arrive shortly.  The Chief Officers scouted the fire perimeter which was approximately 200 yards from the home 6 inch flame lengths and on level ground with grass fuels. An access to the pasture type land was being scouted so that the soon to be 2 Type 6 Engines could move into a suppression mode in the black and split the attack with one proceeding South and the other proceeding North.<br/><br/>Before the Type 6 Engines could be deployed the ICT3 arrived at the 11810 Goodson address (approximately 0115 hours) and immediately began to put on his pack and assemble a drip torch.  He soon approached the two Chief Officers and told him he was going to fire the area and started to move toward the fence line behind the home with Chief 700 (ICT3 qualified and experienced) telling him that they had decided to put engines in place to attack the fire during the advantageous period and that no more fire was needed, the ICT3 proceeded with his operation.  The ICT3 did not have an established holding operation, did not brief the operating units of his intent, did not know where any safety zone or deployment site would be, did not state where his terminal point of the firing operation would be, did not ask for supporting forces to provide for a safe firing operation and did not ask were operating units outside his field of view were located.  Within a few minutes of the ICT3 starting his firing operation a gate with clear roadway was found to allow the Type 6 Engines easy access, attempts to raise the IC to inform him of this alternative were fruitless, he did not respond to Chief 700 requesting his return to the point of contact.  Knowing that the Engines left in position, in particular at 10302 Burgess were on properties greater than 0.5 miles from the road and safety, Chief 700 contacted the ENGB and informed him that El Paso County 3001 was coming his direction with fire and that he should vacate the high fuel load property toward a safety zone at which point he removed units to a safe position.<br/><br/>The Type 3 Engine was left in place due to a large safety zone and defendable space around the 11810 Goodson home and the other elements were moved to the Sylvan Estates (0.25 miles North East) properties where no structure protection had occurred to extinguish fire that was now threatening those homes.  Chief 700 continued to check on the safety of the Type 3 Engine left at 11810 Goodson until the engine was able to be moved to the Sylvan Estates operation.<br/><br/>Upon investigation of the perimeter after the fire activity it was found that the mobile home (10302 Burgess Rd.) had been lost but the barn had survived, the home at 10390 Burgess Rd. had survived with fire encroachment on the property and the home and barn at 11810 Goodson Rd. had survived with heavy damage to the forested areas surrounding the home.  I<br/><br/>The Safety action required by this incident was to move engines from a position of danger that could not be supported due to limiting access, heavy fuel loads along the travel path and unknown actions by the IC who was personally conducting the firing operation.<br/><br/>The IC was 8 miles from the ICP and at the time of his firing operation was answering the radio for the Operations Chief who had to be away from the fire.  The IC by abandoning his ICP was not reachable by other assets, conducted a tactical operation himself, did not provide for personal as well as operational unit safety, failed to provide critical elements of firing operation safety and did not consider tactical options of a person of equal or greater experience and qualification.","The endangered personnel and engines were moved from the area threatened by this poorly conducted firing operation by the IC and combined with other elements to carry out a successful operation of structure protection in a nearby neighborhood.<br/><br/>The incident was reported to the ICT1 Safety who was prepared to submit a SafeNet then later decided he could not due to the fact that the actions took place before the ICT1 assumed command, this is the reason for the late reporting of this incident.","10/25/2013 11:57"

The truck went from level one (Exhaust filter regeneration required) to level 2(Exhaust filter is full) to level 3(Exhaust filter is full, Engine performance is LIMITED.  Pull vehicle safely off roadway and start Regeneration to prevent engine stopping.)  in about 60 seconds or 1 mile.  <br/>Engine 338 is a brand-new, Type 3 Engine. Engine 338 had approximately 3000 miles at the time of the incident.  Engine 338 was picked up from Boise Mobile on the 25th of February 2013.  While in Boise we were briefed on the fact that new Type 3 Engines are equipped with a Regeneration package.  We were told that driving the Engine at Highway speeds would take care of the trucks Regeneration needs and that most likely the truck would passively regenerate while driving; the operator would not need to do anything except drive the truck.  We were also told that if we were, for example on a fire driving at slow speeds, we could actively regenerate the truck manually. An example might be: Regenerating the truck during AM checks or during a time of no activity.  We were told that this process would take about 15 minutes and not to park near anything that could catch fire or melt as the temperatures from the Regeneration process could reach 1200 degrees F.  Hot enough to melt asphalt and certainly hot enough to start a fire.  We have not been able to regenerate manually, we have tried during AM checks and we cannot manually make the truck regenerate.  There is a button on the dashboard for manual regeneration (it is labeled parked regen).  This does not work as explained in the owner’s manual.  Bottom line:  The Truck regenerates when the truck wants to, not when the operator chooses to regenerate.   <br/>Regeneration is a problem on these new trucks.  Engine 371(was picked-up at the same time as 338 in Boise) has also had similar problems.  371 was on a Strike team assignment on the San Bernardino and had to break away from their Strike team while reroute to an active fire.  Engine 371 feels that their truck needs to Regenerate every 2 weeks.  The First time that 371 had to regenerate, their Engine had to be towed and taken to the International dealership where it took 12 hours to Regenerate and get the truck back on the road.  We both find that the trucks will not regenerate manually and that one often has no fore warning that the truck needs to regenerate.  Some obvious safety problems are: what is going to happen when the truck needs to regenerate when we are on an active fire?  Trucks should not be taken into the field that will simply turn themselves off.  LCES on a grass fire cannot be put in place during mobile attack.  We have tried to regenerate manually, but it appears that if the truck is not at extremely high temperature, manual regeneration is not possible.  Our Fleet Manager told us to drive the truck up the mountain to the station in low gear in order to create heat.  We have done this but it does not appear as if we can control the regeneration process with 100 percent certainty.  We cannot predict when or where we are going to respond to fires, and the above mentioned fix of driving in low gear is not a failsafe procedure and I am not convinced that it works.<br/>One final note, when the regeneration problem appeared, we read all manuals and safety sheets in order to try to trouble-shoot the problem, our problems have remained.  The only thing I can think to add is a possible fix or a suggested fix, Like to integrate a manual override switch or a confirmed way to have regeneration happen at your control.” (Kevin Murray Division 3)  <br/>Reply(E-338):  There is a manual override.  The problem is we cannot get that override to work when we need it to.  A further solution would be to not have Engines built with a Regeneration package.  I’m sure that an exemption could be made for emergency equipment.","See Above","07/09/2013 08:17"

Using both a handheld BK-Radio KNG-P150 and the consoles in dispatch office, communications were compromised by the ALMR system.  I counted the time I pressed the transmit button on both the console and handheld, until transmission started in the field, it was up to 8 seconds in length.  This caused many conversations to be walked on during the incident.  Other times I would receive a rogue 'Dispatch did you receive my last transmission?' from field personnel when no transmission had been received in dispatch.  Likewise I would send out multiple transmissions on both the console and handheld, nothing would be received by personnel in the field.  We mitigated this communications break down by using cell phones as cell service was more reliable then our ALMR communications.  However if a large complex incident were to happen with no cell phone service, the communications that are in place with this system could cause a major break down.  This would be a detriment when trying to protect life and property or support a medical situation.","We mitigated this communications break down by resorting to the use of cell phones.

I listened to the radio traffic (on the way back and during this incident) from both communication systems and definately agree that both parties are missing out on their situational awareness by being on separate communication systems.

After arriving on scene I then contacted KIDC on cellphone to give a quick size-up that the fire was contained and controlled and no other resources were needed.

I was then instructed to go and “check the area out” and that Branch II would tie in with me on the division “in a little bit”. <br/><br/>      I had to request information for the following information (taken from the inside back cover of the IRPG)-<br/>             BRIEFING CHECKLIST<br/>Situation<br/>      ¿	Fire name (OK), location(OK), map orientation, other incidents in area-(requested Branch II to draw map of fire )<br/>      ¿	Terrain influences-(not relayed)<br/>      ¿	Fuel type and conditions-(relayed after requested “Heavy brush”)<br/>      ¿	Fire weather (previous, current, and expected)<br/>       o	Winds, RH, Temperature, etc.-(unknown, Branch I guessed it would get cooler and the RH’s would come up through the night)<br/>      ¿	Fire behavior previous, current, and expected-(relayed after requested “Torching and spotting”)<br/>       o	Time of day, Alignment of slope and wind, etc.(Self evident)<br/>Mission/Execution<br/>      ¿	Command <br/>       o	Incident Commander/Immediate supervisor-(unknown, Branch I accidentally referred to himself as IC a number of times)<br/>      ¿	Leader’s intent<br/>       o	Overall strategy/objectives(OK)<br/>      ¿	Specific tactical assignments(OK)<br/>      ¿	Contingency plans unknown,-(not relayed)<br/>Communications<br/>      ¿	Communication plan-(had to find a Forest Service engine to clone from and get frequencies)<br/>       o	Tactical, Command, Air-to-ground frequencies-(relayed after requested)<br/>       o	Cell phone numbers-(unknown, not relayed)<br/>      ¿	Medevac plan-(Branch II stated to call him if there was an emergency)<br/>      ¿	Service/Support(OK)<br/>      ¿	Other resources<br/>       o	Working adjacent (unsure of actual resources) and those available to order-(unknown, not relayed)<br/>       o	Aviation operations-(self evident through radio communications)<br/>      ¿	Logistics<br/>       o	Transportation(OK)<br/>       o	Supplies and equipment(OK)<br/>      ¿	Risk Management<br/>      ¿	Identify known hazards and risks unknown,-(not relayed)<br/>      ¿	Identify control measures to mitigate hazards/reduce risk(OK)<br/>      ¿	Identify trigger points for re-evaluating operations-(unknown, not relayed)<br/><br/>I left the “ICP” at ~1830 and tied in with a Forest Service engine to clone my radio and get a list of the assigned frequencies. After 45 minutes of attempting to follow the given driving directions, I was able to make my way to the fireline. I attempted to contact Branch I and II for an hour with no success. I was able to contact the adjoining DIVS and establish the approximate locations of the division breaks and resources assigned. Because I had no communication with command, I had to drive back down to the “ICP” to establish communication as well as confirm DIVS assignment and resources. From “ICP” I was able to communicate with the resources assigned to my division clearly. I returned to the division and was able to communicate with Branch I clearly, with no changes on my part in regards to frequencies, tones, or radio use. <br/> <br/>      At approximately 22:40, an unknown night IC stated that all resources would share the same tactical frequency through the night until day shift arrived. While relaying this information, I learned an adjoining division did not know or remember that the resources on my division were under my supervision, even though this information was relayed by me upon assuming DIVS responsibility. There was no stated transfer of command as required in “Interagency Standards for Fire and Fire Aviation Operations” Chapter 11-3 #3. <br/><br/>      At approximately 0700, during tactical operations communications, I learned that an adjoining division was to be relieved by a day shift DIVS. I attempted to contact Branch to locate my relief DIVS with no response. For approximately 1.5 hours, I attempted to contact any Branch, Operations, or IC on the assigned night shift frequency, with no response. I was finally able to contact a day shift engine who relayed that day shift tactical frequencies had been changed, which was not relayed to anyone on night shift. Once I was able to determine the frequencies, find them through a Google search on an IPhone, and program them, I was able to contact day operations and eventually my relief day DIVS.  My relief did not arrive until 9:30.","Mitigations and corrective action stated in narrative.<br/><br/>      The Gorgonio Fire was in close proximity (less than one mile) of the 2006 Esperanza Fire, which resulted in the loss of five U.S. Forest Service firefighters. The lack of communication and situational awareness on the Gorgonio Fire were especially alarming considering the following from the Esperanza Fire Accident Investigation Factual Report-<br/><br/>Causal Factor 1.<br/>There was a loss of situational awareness concerning the dangers associated with<br/>potential fire behavior and fire environment while in a complex wildland urban<br/>interface situation.<br/>(Findings #12, #16, #18, #19,#20, #21,#22,#23, #25, #26, #32, and #33)<br/><br/>Contributing Factor 6.<br/>Communications – The five Forest Service engines used a Forest Service tactical<br/>radio frequency not assigned to the fire for tactical discussions. Effective<br/>communication controls were not in effect prior to the incident.<br/>(Findings #32, #33, and #34)<br/><br/>Contributing Factor 7.<br/>Leader’s intent – Communications between Branch II and Engine 57 Captain at the<br/>Octagon House were not clear or understood.<br/>(Finding #15)<br/><br/>While these factors do not mirror the situation described in the narrative, they are close enough to cause concern.

While we have done our best to mitigate the problems locally through support from our service technician, it has required a large investment of time, money, and energy, not to mention unnecessary stress to fire, dispatch, and communications personnel during both emergency incidents and routine operations.  Ongoing problems with the communications system occur multiple times throughout the day and range in complexity: multiple tones intermittently fail resulting in discontinuous communications with field resources and aircraft engaged in prescribed fire and wildfire activities; network problems and radio bank failures have resulted in dispatch’s inability to communicate with certain areas of the forest, including an entire district; malfunctioning national flight following has diminished dispatch’s ability to communicate with aircraft, making it necessary to fall back to local repeaters; and continuous failure of the ModUcom consoles inhibits dispatch’s functionality and efficiency due to their inability to maintain continuous communication with fire personnel.  These compounding inconsistencies often necessitate handing control of incident communications to the local districts, which further inhibits the dispatch center’s ability to wholly function.  Above all, the failure of the communications system presents a serious safety issue for all personnel due to its inability to provide reliable service.","The dispatch center, fire personnel, districts, and service technician have submitted multiple tickets to the Customer Help Desk as issues became known, and the service technician has worked towards resolving some of the issues.  These problems have also been brought to the attention of line officers.  This SAFENET is being submitted to help facilitate the process of getting the service technician support in correcting the issues.","04/30/2013 07:51"

We currently have wildland fire activity on the forest and communication with resources on the line is eliminated during periods of time when these interruptions are taking place.  Alert tones and 'squelching' are descriptors of these interuptions and at times up to 15 seconds at length.  These interruptions are coming more often and creating bigger safety issues.  Troy Stebbins, the ONLY local Radio technician is trying to solve the problem, but the problem is becoming more and more of a concern with fire activity increasing on the forest.  We do have video if this problem.          <br/><br/>The following is a clipping from an Aviation SafeCOM (13-0186) for this problem:<br/>Smokejumper plane on a detection flight over the Forest. Communications from dispatch to the aircraft was interrupted several times by Scratching and Alert Tones coming over the South Frequency. This problem has been on-going for 3-4 weeks now with ground resources, but is now making communications with aircraft difficult and at time impossible. Work around is National Flight following, but was NOT the frequency utilized for with local missions. Local radio Tech has been working on this issue, but there seems to be no solution developing.

Engine crew proceeded with their pre-burn assignments of prepping the road for 2 hours. Upon completion, the engine crew noticed the hunter’s vehicle was still there and deemed there was high probability of the hunter being inside the burn unit. Both the Burn Boss and Fire Staff Officer had firsthand knowledge of the vehicle’s location and were unaware of the hunter’s location, yet they proceeded to the Test Fire site. The Engine Boss (ENGB) said he tried to look for the hunter, but was unsuccessful and that the engine crew could try to contact him if they want. The engine crew stayed for 30 min using the siren, air horn and loud speaker multiple times in hopes the hunter would appear, but he never did. The ENGB had notified the Burn Boss that himself and the engine crew were unable to locate the hunter. Burn Boss proceeded with the test fire and told the ENGB and crew to set up on their respective Red-Cockaded Woodpecker (RCW) clusters for lighting, which were well interior of the burn unit. The test fire was deemed good and the Firing Boss and Fire Staff Officer pulled fire along the northern end of burn, 1.5 miles in length, and approximately 100 acres involved with an active backing fire. Burn Boss had stated earlier once the northern line was complete aerial ignition operations would continue as planned. After 10 minutes, the hunter randomly appeared at the interior-most RCW cluster and tied in with fire personnel staged there. It was learned that the hunter was almost 2 miles away from his vehicle towards the eastern edge of the burn unit along the creek and was set up less than a half mile from the test fire. The hunter was unaware of the current prescribed burn operation and became very disgruntled upon hearing what little had been done to locate him. He expressed concern that if he had not decided to leave that the burn would have continued regardless and that fire personnel had showed disregard to his personal well-being. The hunter was asked if he smelled smoke and he replied that “he did but that he didn’t think anything of it since the USFS had been burning for 3 months, so there’s always a smell of smoke.” The hunter also mentioned that he “faintly heard the siren as well, but again thought nothing of it since there’s a state highway a few miles away and the faint sound of sirens is commonplace.” Due to his distance, he was out of range of the engine crew’s loud speaker broadcast, which instructed him to return to his vehicle cause of prescribed fire operations. The Burn Boss was notified that the hunter had been found and once he got out of the unit the helicopter was requested for aerial ignition. At the AAR there was no mention of the hunter from the Firing Boss, Burn Boss or Fire Staff Officer. In subsequent burn briefings there was no mention of mitigation measures that should be implemented to avoid, or eliminate similar incidents. At no time during the burn did the Burn Boss convey to personnel what steps should be taken for locating the hunter. Actions taken to locate the hunter were initiated and implemented by the engine module.","See above narrative.","05/20/2013 13:07"

I observed at least five<br/>lightning events that were (by using the three-second count/ mile theory) within one mile of our location.<br/>When we were finished with the job and back in the truck, we were all soaking wet and cold.<br/>Fast forward to today (October 28, 2020).<br/><br/>Upon arriving to work, I asked the Lead Fuels Tech what we would be doing for the day. He informed me<br/>that we would be cutting line today to finish the line that we have been working on for approximately 5<br/>days. The remaining stretch of line is approximately 1/5 of a mile. My job is to run the chainsaw.<br/><br/>Weather forecast for today shows our work area under a flood watch<br/>Rain and possibly a thunderstorm. High near 51. Northeast wind 5 to 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is<br/>90%. New rainfall amounts between three quarters and one inch possible.<br/><br/>I asked our Lead Tech if he was serious. He said, 'Yeah, I'm dead serious. The Crew Boss wants that line<br/>finished today, and, he's not letting us take the UTV, so I guess we'll just have to hike our asses off with<br/>all of our gear in the rain'.<br/><br/>I then asked the Fuels Tech if he had seen the radar. He said, 'The Crew Boss was in there looking at the<br/>radar and he doesn’t think it's going to be raining up there.'<br/>When the Crew Boss (supervisor) got out of the shower, I asked him, 'Are you really going to make us go<br/>up there today and cut that line out?'<br/><br/>He responded, 'Yes, I am. I'm being nice. I'm giving you a job to do. If it's raining, you all should really be<br/>sitting at home and not getting paid.'<br/><br/>My response was, 'Friday is supposed to be clear and sunny with highs in the fifties. If that is the case, can<br/>you not send us home today and have us cut that line on Friday? Kenwood is currently under a flood watch<br/>with thunderstorms forecasted for the next 48 hours.'<br/><br/>He then gave me a slew of vulgarities and told me to, 'Turn all my shit in, go home, and don't ever come<br/>back'.<br/><br/>I did what he said, and I am now unemployed.

I<br/>presented him with the same list of hazards above. I also presented him with an alternative solution.<br/>And questioning his decision making skills got me fired.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that the Crew Boss (supervisor) does not take the health and safety of his subordinates<br/>seriously. Two of us are temporary/ part-time employees. We do not accrue sick or annual leave. If we<br/>get sick and have to miss work, we just have to miss work and take LWOP, or come to work sick.

(Tac X was actually in Tac Ys space, Old clone, completely wrong zone). This has been compounded by communications unit using laptop programming to lock KNG and DPH radios from making changes to priorities or making changes to the cloned groups frequency’s or naming conventions. Some units still have the ability to create a new master group others were completely locked out of thier radio.<br/> Due to steep and challenging terrain and resources spread over many miles, command is sometimes needed to maintain communications with supervisor, resources and adjacent resources.  Due to Primary being locked on command, resources would not hear radio communications on Tac X the preferred Primary channel. <br/>2) Due to COVID many briefings (morning/night shift, OPS/204 updates) are being completed through radio communications to base camps and spike camps., Command Radio channels are locked up with communication for unreasonable amounts of time (one plus hours for briefings and up to 15mins for OPS/204 Updates with minimal or no radio breaks)  Often during high risk times during operational periods I.E Transition times between day and night shifts when driving is occurring or resources are departing the line and around 1400/1600 (take 10 at ?)

Due to the fire activity throughout California, visibility was limited to approximately 1 mile.<br/>A local USFS T-3 Engine was enroute to cover at one of FS stations in the area when the call came over the radio.  The module consisted of an operator and 2-FFT2's, 1- cover Engine Boss, 1-cover FFT2 (with no fire experience) for a total of 5 personel<br/>Once it was confirmed that the local volunteers could see smoke, the On-Duty-Chief requested a full wildland dispatch.  The dispatch included: 1-AA, 2-AT, 2-Helicopters, 3 - T3 USFS Engines, 2- T6 Contract Engines, and 2 - Chief Officers.  The On-Duty-Chief did not respond, (Normal protocols were followed, it is my experience that normally on-duty Chief does not respond, and supports both local ECC and the incident as it unfolds from the unit, not the field). However, the Battalion Chief for the District responded. It is my opinion that the majority of R5 forests SOP’s around I/A have a BC response on-scene.<br/>The first resource to arrive at scene was an Air Attack.  The local Battalion was contacted by the Air Attack.  After a brief discussion, the Air Attack advised the Battalion to keep the Helicopters enroute and to cancel the tankers, due to visibility.  The B.C concurred with the plan.<br/>The first ground resources to arrive were a state helicopter w/ crew.  The crew gave a size up and began progressing up the left flank. In addition to the size-up normally the first on scene would also identify as the IC.  I am assuming that the State Helicopter had an IC4 qualified individual.  Fire behavior consisted of creeping and smoldering.  After that, 1-T6 contract engine and the local T3 USFS Engine arrived on scene.  After briefing his crew on LCES, the Engine Boss lead his crew to the fires edge and began a progressive hoselay.  The Engine Boss noticed the local Division Chief at scene and driving down the 2-track (left flank).  The Engine Boss asked if the Division Chief was going to take IC of the incident and the Division Chief replied, 'That's (name exludeded) job, ain't it?'  The Engine Boss then turned and continued to direct his crew with the hoselay.  <br/>Once the Division Chief went on scene with dispatch, he was then delegated as the Irish IC from Dispatch. Dispatch is not responsible to designate IC. Dependent on complexity, local knowledge, etc., determines who the IC would be.  In this case, I would think that the BC or DIVS Chief would self-identify as the IC. The Division Chief had not been taking notes, did not have an initial attack documentation form (Created by the Forest) and did not know who was all at scene of the incident.  He also drove through the origin of the fire.  The Division Chief grabbed an extra initial attack documentation form from the Engine Boss' clip board and began his size up of the incident.  Soon after, the local Battalion Chief arrived at scene of the incident.  It was unclear what the local Battalion Chief's assignment on the incident was. The BC normal duties would be to oversee and support incident and step in if needed.<br/>At approximately 15:00, the Division Chief and Battalion were notified of a spot fire on another incident on the District.  This required both of them to leave the current incident and return to the district office 'to make phone calls.'  IC was then transfered to the Local T3 Engine Boss.","The local Engine Boss knew that he had two Chief Officers enroute to the incident.  Therefore, it was implied that one Chief or the other would take command of the incident and allow him to direct his newly aquired crew.  This was only partially true.  The Incident Commander asked the Engine Boss to be an 'Operations' for his Type 4 incident.  The Engine Boss reminded the IC that the local Battalion Chief was also at scene of the incident (unclear of his assigned roll).  The Engine Boss assisted the Incident Commander by providing him an update of the resources at scene, updated acreage, line and hose progression, and communications relay for the local government engines.  (This is unclear to me, other than the Engine Boss should assist the IC with updates and a overall briefing.)<br/><br/>The corrective action in relation to this incident is yet to be decided. <br/><br/>What is the roll of an On-Duty-Chief or a Chief Officer who responds to an incident?   To supervise, support, and intervene when necessary. There aren’t any standard SOP’s that designate duties, roles, and responsibilities, of BC’s or DIV Chief’s on incidents.  Some forests may have specific duties outlined in their Forest SOP’s. That is situationally dependent.  However, it sends a convoluted message to responding resources when Chief Officers show up to incidents and do nothing for the good of the incident.  There have been several instances of Chief Officers not assuming command of an incident, however, they continually make decisions as if they were the I.C.  Sometimes they order resources, cancel resources, sometimes the Duty Chief shows up to a fire and begins talking to firefighters about nothing in regards to the incident, all while they are trying to construct handline, all while not assuming command of the incident.<br/><br/>Do Chief Officers have to be the Incident Commander at all fires?  No, but they should be ready and willing to assume command as they arrive.","09/24/2020 09:15"

This was not my only form of commo as I had a radio on me as well, but it cost me two weeks of fire information and what if something had happened to my radio? I was told that the National Park Service had this ridiculous feature disabled because of these kinds of issues. The Forest Service and all other agencies should have this removed as well if that is true, as it costs hours and hours and hours of time to recover once it happens not including all of the work that is gone from it.

It appears the new UPS that was installed last winter stopped working and when we tried to flip the bypass switch, it did not bypass the UPS, so the crucial communications equipment was still unusable. After talking with the SME, the issue is coming from the step-down transformer not working. Basically, the transformer that is the funnel of the electricity stopped funneling. Based on some data he was able to see last week, he doesn't believe it was because we overloaded the system, he believes it was a manufacturer defect. We called in our local FS radio technician, a state office engineering employee, and a local Boise District engineering employee to help us troubleshoot the issue. We also called all Duty Officers for the respective agencies/districts, notified the neighboring dispatch centers and the Great Basin Coordination Center,and notified county dispatch centers. We were formulating a plan that if any activity were to occur we would have a BLM dispatcher utilize a vehicle to dispatch an incident, we were having all FS radio traffic go through the districts and the IDL would take traffic at the Southwest office. The tankerbase was flight following any aircraft traffic that was currently flying. <br/><br/>We got the power supply moved from the UPS to the main power (see description below) around 10:50 and were again able to communicate with the field using the radios, the phones were working and our computers were back up. However, a SME trying to troubleshoot the issue was working in our radio room and flipped a breaker that then made everything shut off again at around 11:50. This time around things were back up in about 10 minutes. The SME mentioned that the way our office is wired, the flipping of that breaker should not have turned our communications equipment off. <br/><br/>We are currently working off the main power with a generator back-up so if the power were to go out, we may have a few minutes of down-time until the generator kicks in automatically.","One of our lead dispatchers had the idea to put the phones, radio's and computers onto the main power and off of the UPS. So we got many extension cords and power strips and moved our communications equipment to the outlets that are not supported by the UPS. We are currently running on the main power with a generator backup until a more permanent fix can be implemented. If a new part needs to be ordered, it could take a week or more to arrive.","08/19/2020 10:24"

After seeing a email from the RMACC, it was found out that the USDA CIO group did a security push over the night of Thursday 08/13/2020 and Friday AM 08/14/2020. This push found that the WILDCAD system used by dispatch centers throughout the country was a issue. Which it is not! The email advised that there are 54 centers that are currently down and that it might take 1-2 days to fix the issue. One fix is to go to a cloud base WILDCAD which is new this year and my center and some others are not on line with yet. This is not the first issue with the new USDA CIO group and IT issues with interagency dispatch centers. But currently this is the biggest issue we are dealing with in the zone and the region for the USFS based centers. My center is currently under very high to extreme fire danger and have fire restriction's in place on one whole forest and one district. We also have a high visitor use on the federal lands that fall within my dispatch zone. We are also supporting large fires in the state of CO. Without our CAD system this can pose a issue and safety issue with our ground and sir resources. And also the timeliness of dispatching to a wildland fire within our zone or gacc. <br/>This is unacceptable for a IT group to do pushes during fire season and extreme fire season. Again this is effecting 54 centers throughout the country and some of those centers have very large fire of 5,000ac or larger.","Have placed tickets with Bighorn (WILDCAD) and also CIO to have this matter fixed but it will not be a timely matter.

The Bozeman Dispatch Center is support a wildland fire and now is switching legal documentation to an excel spreedsheet. This is no the only time and most definitely will not be the last time this will happen. If we were dealing with a emerging incident or medical emergency, this hinders and slows already overstressed dispatchers that are fatigued from low staffing levels and high overtime hours.

I can tell you here at my center I will have a hard time getting the needed funds to acquire the needed number of user licenses. I understand there is a 120 day trial period but after that it is $799 for a five pack of licenses. Since this issue is being directly caused by CIO and this is the second time this summer it has occurred are they going to be paying that for us? I would need about 15-20 user licenses for my center, that’s $2397 to $3196 which I do not have in my budget this time of year coming up on spending cut offs and since all unspent funds got turned back over to the forest.

I also worked CAL-FIRE 00-05 and now the City of Corona since 2005. I am a radio nerd I understand this stuff well. We really need to get this fixed. Cleveland National Forest BK radios are not programmed to appropriately transmit the CAL-FIRE tactical channel transmit tone of 192.8 (tone 16). I noticed during IA when I was calling CNF units they could hear me but I could not hear them. They were up the line and I could not physically get to them. Interagency resources from CAL-FIRE that were face to face confirmed they were on the right channel. The following shift I worked with the same CNF units during mop up and we had the same issue. I physically got into the programming menu in the radio and confirmed that the radio was not programmed to send 192.8 (tone 16). CAL-FIRE has tone protected their tactical channels since 2011 and we are still dealing with this with the legacy BK radios which was what was being used. The BK GPH/DPH radios do not allow tone selection per channel if OST is going to be used in a group. In November 2012 there was an article in Fire Management Today that highlighted a work around for this issue. I attached the article and it goes over specifically how the radios should be programmed to operate. If you need anymore clarification please reach out to me. We have a great working relationship with the CNF and the intent of this is to make sure all R5 forests radios that are using GPH/DPH radios are programmed safely.","We reprogrammed a few radios on the incident.

IHC Foreman, CRWB (T) plus one saw team hiked into fire and the IHC Foreman waked perimeter etc. to gather intel, SA.  Most of the day fire behavior was creeping very little smoke showing.  A skid road was opened by a Dozer then the Dozer continued pushing a line to gain access to the fire.  During this time heavy air support from helicopters was being utilized by the incident.  Water sources and medical sites were being scouted by others as well the Dozer line snagged and improved for access with UTV and personnel safety.  After IHC and Overhead scouted the fire the mutual decision/recommendation was to utilize Feller Bunchers and other misc heavy equipment to construct line to minimize exposure to ground resources.  The IHC was informed by the local firefighters this is a common tactic used In the area and the only concern was to make sure the decks are in a secure spot.  Based on past experience from local, equipment could put the line in one day minimizing aerial hazards and still be able to produce while air craft were dropping buckets of water.  IHC Superintendent, Foreman, CRWB (T) along with all other resources on scene agreed with the recommendation by the locals to use equipment.

Snags, bug kill trees and heavy dead and down material.  Air space vs ground resources work area was tight.

Most work was being done by equipment as well scouting for medical evac site access and water resource.  IHC#2 arrived roughly 0900, walked into the fire to scout and gather Intel.  At around 1300-1400 the TFLD or OSC called IHC#1 to drive to the cabin for a discussion/chat.  Present at the meeting was the TFLD (T), IHC#1 Superintendent, Foreman and CRWB (T), Type 2 I/A crew boss (T), IHC#2 Superintendent and few others.

IHC#2 commented to IHC#1 I don’t mean to step on your toes but yeah I think we can work in their safely and cut it out, I’m open for discussion.  OSC asked IHC#1 what were they going to do and would they go in there in and work.  IHC#1 Superintendent said that they will Turn down the assignment that the initial plan was agreed upon and based on the current situation the snag hazard is still there.  Utilizing the equipment with air support in the area, minimizing ground resource exposure and the risk is not worth the gain.  IHC#1 was told that a someone from the district or the forest would discuss the turn down with us and that we would most likely be released to NRGA back to Missoula.  1930 IHC#1 CRWB (T) called OSC and asked what was the plan for them 8-10-2020.  Over the radio IHC#1 was told released back to the GACC/NRGA in the morning.<br/><br/>Concern:  Incident overhead, forest managment district management neither reached out to IHC#1 to discuss the Turn Down.  Continued heavy exposure to helicopters.  IHC#2 before meeting took place was already moving crew into position to engage fire on the ground.  Through conversations and documentation IHC#1 intent was not clearly stated to IHC#2 by IC or OSC.  There was a perception that the IC and OSC even though offered the suggestion of equipment use and agreed upon it that they were still adamant about ground resources instead so they halted operations so that IHC#2 could scout.  Nor did the IC or OSC explain in depth the details to the original plan, risk assessment etc. to IHC#2.  IHC#1 could of been released immediately to be better utilized instead were told to stage at DP wait for dinner spend the night and head for Missoula in the AM 8-10-2020.<br/><br/>8-10-2020<br/>IHC#1 left Lincoln 0630 for Missoula to report to GACC/NRGA. <br/><br/>Concern: During transit IHC#1 received a phone call from NRGA and appeared confused on status.

Equipment could work easier while air support continued and the amount of time for the equipment to construct a fuel break was safe, efficient and effective.<br/><br/><br/>8-9-2020. Turn Down assignment was quick to the point and not belabored. It was apparent to IHC#1 that IHC#2 was going to engage regardless due to the crew moving in position.  The action taken was a Turn Down by IHC#1 based on a risk assessment previously that the high rate of snags, bug kill dead and down material and past local successful tactics utilizing equipment was safe, efficient and should prove to be effective minimizing exposure to ground resources.

We arrived around 1500 and received our operational briefing. Terrain was very steep to the extent that multiple resources had to take shelter behind trees and boulders as rolling material fell down the hill. The rolling material had created a few spot fires beneath working crews. Fuel Type consisted of Brush, Timber and a light to moderate needle cast duff layer. The Fire was 40 acres at the time on a mid slope west facing aspect. There were 2 divisions, Alpha on the Left and Zulu on the Right. We were assigned to Div Alpha. 1 Hour into constructing handline the Chainsaw Operator ran out of fuel and needed to fill the chainsaw up. We were constructing straight fireline going direct and indirect in some places of the fire to choose favorable line cutting conditions. We got to the point where the fire started to progress laterally on the slope and crews had to construct under slung line. While fueling up 15 ft away from the the fire edge a burning log had a piece of charcoal that was on fire and rolled down the hill where the under slung line was going to be placed. the sawyer operator was behind a rock with his back to the fires edge looking up hill about 15 ft away in the green. While fueling the chainsaw the piece of charcoal that was on fire rolled over the large 5x5 ft round boulder and landed on the chainsaw operators chainsaw fuel tank. The tank cap was open and the coal caused the chainsaw to ignite. the chainsaw  was not operable afterwards and the chainsaw operator was not injured.","I abandoned the chainsaw fueling operation immediately and ran way. If it wasn't for me having my long sleeve nomex rolled down and gloves on while fueling then there might of been a possibility of getting light burns on my hands.","08/05/2020 09:52"

Upon briefing at the DP ICT3 (T) had very little pertinent info to share and had technical difficulties uploading maps.  IAP’s were light with information and further into assignment had some out dated/inaccurate information.  Concern lack of engagement, knowledge skill and ability to operate efficiently.  Dependent on technology that they are unfamiliar with.<br/><br/>2: IHC assignment was to coordinate the completion of line and burn over 1 mile utilizing a road system and Dozer line.  Then the remaining days secure line 1/2 chain then one chain utilizing Skidgens and tenders. Assignment was completed by both IHC’s and coordination between both IHC’s was sufficient, productive and safe.  Due to uncontrollable factors one IHC worked past 16 hours to meet this critical mission objective.  <br/><br/>Concern was burning conditions were mediocre and resulted in spotty dirty burn with little depth.  Mopping up a planned ignition that resulted in spotty dirty burn exposing exposing ground resources to fire weekend trees and endless work since the burn was so spotty. Pressure to utilize equipment on narrow roads or DZR lines to secure line.  Utilizing a national resource was ineffective after 2nd shift based on what actual assignment needed.  During the extended shift communication was poor from DIV (T) to IHC on relief resources and during shift making intent clear.<br/><br/>3: Logistics was poor inadequate at times condition of food, quality or amount.   There were resources who never received food.  Dinner was at times cold, vegetarian meals lacked serious nutrients at one point it was a plate of rice.  Lunch was typical seemed 50/50 on quality and amount.  Breakfast was bagged light lacked quality etc.  Sleeping areas were dispersed and not initially identified it was more go find a spot.  Shower conditions were unacceptable due to being shower trees providing no privacy.  It did appear best practices were implemented for COVID-19.","1: Based on IHC experience, knowledge skill and ability of IHC Superintendent, Foreman along with CRWB (T), best interest was to assist in PDF Avenza downloads, take what information given try not to ask more than what IMT was capable of and just head to line for operation shift and gather solid intel.  Recommendation: Is know your tools and your capabilities don’t rely solely on technology.  Prepare Prepare Prepare.<br/><br/>2: Burning conditions IHC varied patterns quite a bit to achieve best results there was no option nor direction to stop burning.  Instead of initial mop up IHC recommended and acted on letting burn continue to clean it self up and only mop-up what was necessary to prevent escape based on current and expected fire behavior.  IHC during remaining shifts based on current and predicted fire behavior utilized the resources needed to secure line minimizing any firefighter resource exposure.  It appeared after time that needing an IHC was unnecessary based on the low complexity of the assignment vs other needs in R1.  Recommendations: IMT and trainees need to have more engagement with resources, know your ground see the changes to understand what makes sense.  Utilize resources effectively type don’t make busy monotonous work with no positive benefit, outcome and only increasing exposure and risk. <br/><br/>3: Utilize resources and vendors that will produce quality food for firefighters and supply sufficient amount.  Ask diet restricted resources for ideas on what they can eat will help vendors prepare quality meals. Breakfast can be as easy some times supplying fruit, cereal milk yogurts.  Packaging of meals need to be sturdy and capable of securing food.  Sleeping areas pre identified and known.

The Incident Command Post was based in the middle of a COVID-19 hotspot (Okanogan County) and everyone was at increased risk of transmission. At that time I noticed there were many signs that said, 'Wear A Mask', there was hand sanitizer available at the door, distancing protocols were placed on signs around the entrance, a box of surgical masks was open and available, and everyone was required to take their temperature prior to entering the building. It appeared at first that the DNR's policy on COVID-19 precautions were going to be strictly adhered to.<br/><br/>During the first couple of days of the fire assignment, I observed most members of the IMT wearing face masks, with two to three individuals pulling the masks below their noses or temporarily removing their masks to speak. By the end of the assignment and as teams were beginning to demobilize and leave the fire assignment, members of the IMT were in the cafeteria without face masks and with no social distancing in place. I counted 3 individuals who still had their masks on by the end of the assignment. <br/><br/>Every single person who was a part of the Anglin/Green Fires had to come through the Incident Command Post and interact with members of the IMT. Because of the lack of adherence to face mask protocols, specifically by Incident Management Team members, those individuals potentially exposed the entire camp to COVID-19.","I continued to diligently wear a face mask and observe other COVID-19 safety protocols, such as temperature-taking, hand washing, and frequent sanitizing.

The fire was threatening multiple structures and multiple resources were dispatched.  Resources arrived fairly quickly.  Division 7 arrived on scene.  Once this happened communications began to suffer.  It was an hour into the incident before anyone knew who the IC was.  Division 7 had trouble keeping his composure on the radio and yelled with no brevity on many occasions.  For example one radio communication on Air to Ground to the helicopter lasted over 30 seconds that could have been resolved with 'Start at the Head, on the Northwest side'.  This was a common occurrence throughout the incident.  Other important traffic was lost when cut off by the division generally resulting in unnecessary information and confused many people, especially when they found out that the IC was not the Division.<br/><br/>Lessons learned with AAR:<br/>1.  There is a difference on between urgency and yelling on the radio.  (Yelling causes confusion and leads people to believe that you are panicking)<br/>2.  Brevity is key.  Important communications could not be sent or received as 20-40 second transmissions were being made on the tac and Air to Ground Channels.  Often these transmissions produced no useful information to anyone on the fire.  Make sure you think what you need accomplished before making the radio transmission.<br/>3.  Announce the IC and allow them to do their job.  If there is a qualified IC, it confuses people when somebody else is making all the decisions especially on parts of the fire that they are unfamiliar.  We all understand roles of operations and the chain of command but if this was the case on this fire it was never communicated.","Individual resources on the fire resulted to face to face communications as radios became unreliable with the amount of traffic.  The fire was only 17 acres in total so this was relatively easy.  Our module approaching the incident were given an internal briefing to make sure that they took care of each other and those around them as it was not confirmed if the radio would be available in the time of an urgent need. LCES was strictly enforced and all members of the module were told to stay together within a yelling distance.  It was a short lived fire but was discussed including another tac channel if the commotion continued.","08/06/2020 08:23"

I was assigned to a fire with multiple other resources and I was assisting on the fire when the I.C asked one of the Captains from the local area to help by doing an overhead position on the I.A. and he was told he couldn't because they are required to have two drivers on the engine at all times.  The I.C. laughed because he thought he was joking but then realized he wasn't, the engine capt apologized and told him he had to find another person to do the overhead assignment.  What is the thinking on this decision?  I'm from R5 and we don't run with this standard nor have I even heard of this.  Not being able to pull some of your most experienced firefighters off their engines to assist in an incident that is growing is a safety issue that needs to be addressed.  The captain later stated he has another qualified driver on the engine along with a trainee CDL driver but they aren't allowed to operate the engine without two drivers. Why are we willing to overwhelm an I.C. when qualified people are there ready to assist but can't because of a rule that can and will put lives in danger. We had engines, dozers, aircraft and crews so the span of control was more than the I.C. could handle and assistance was needed. There is no lawful rule or regulation requiring two drivers on the engine as far as I know, but apparently there was a letter put out 4 years ago addressing this.

Our assignment was to go direct along with two other hand crews during the extended attack phase. The next day we were able to wrap the fire with the assistance of a dozer and our crew inherited 3 miles of hand line and dozer line now division Zulu. The other two crews had been reassigned to mop up in other divisions. The Nevada team 2 was getting in place to take over the fire that day at four separate storm cells converged with lightning strikes within 3 miles of our line and we were forced to find a safe place to wait the storm out. Our Captain took some of this time to ask the Division (Steve Baram deputy fire staff on the Boise NF) and Task Force Leader about what the team's protocols on testing were and if they could help facilitate our crew getting tested before returning to our district. <br/><br/>Our home unit and forest have both stated that they would like us to be tested either before returning home or once we've returned home but prior to coming back to work and going home to our families. Being that Elko, Nevada, is now a hot zone for Covid we thought we would check with the local agencies to see if they could help. <br/><br/>The next morning one of our crew members overheard our Division talking with the Line Medic and Task Force about how ridiculous it was that we were demanding testing. Our Captain went to speak with them about what appears to be a misunderstanding, being that we were not demanding or even asking them to pay for it, simply to help us find a testing facility that could accommodate 17 crew members. The Division became visibly angry stating that fire fighters assume a certain risk when they come out on the line and that the team would not pay for testing because the cost was too high. Our Captain reiterated that we were not asking for them to pay for it, just to help us find a facility to get tested at. The Division and Line Medic both stated they did not have time and walked away.<br/><br/>At that point, we were assigned to three miles of hand line and dozer line to start mopup - a chain in that was not accessible by vehicle with no clear medical plan in place. The dedicated short haul ship was available for IA (and was used), Communications stated to use a repeater that was not functional for CMD. The next day the communications issue and medical plan were still not clarified or fixed. We did received assistance from a contract crew and strike team of engines cutting our workload down to 1.5 miles of line to secure 1 chain in. Our captain ended up getting a flat tire while putting our lookout\human repeater in place to help with the coms issues, while doing this he punctured a tire. Division asked him to stay on the line since he was able to use the spare but would have no option if something were to happen again. There were qualified crew members that would allow him to leave inorder to get the tire fixed. <br/><br/>At the end of the debrief that day Taskforce and Division were given an update and stated we would be back out the next day to finish up. However, the next morning our crew was demobilized. The Captain went to speak with the Division along with HR to figure out why this happened because it some of the actions were looking like reprisal for asking about testing. The HR rep had a conflict of interest due to the fact that he was detailed to the Boise office and recused himself, So the  IC, IC trainee, and Operations were all brought into the conversation and assured us it was just part of the glide path that was projected - even though we were the only crew demobilized and had been told the day earlier that we would be back on the division. <br/><br/>The Division made unsafe decisions on the fire line with regards to the ruptured tire and failed to ensure safety on the fire line with a cohesive medical plan. His lack of awareness on Covid-19 protocol and the situation in Elko, NV, is dangerous. DIVS acted like a bully when presented with safety concerns and belittled subordinates, dismissing concerns without explanation or mitigation. He is either negligent in his duties or our removal from the fire was an attempt at reprisal for wanting to follow our local and national protocol: to maintain a safe work environment and protect our families back at home.","We have been maintaining temperature and symptoms checks, wearing masks, using gloves, and maintaining proper hygiene along with limiting exposures at stores not going to restruangs and finding safer camp arrangements to protect against covid 19.<br/>For comunications we put in place a human repeater and lookout.<br/>For the incohearant medical plan we have 3 emt's and one advanced EMT who has medical direction from the USFS and was granted reciprocity in NV. <br/><br/>As a result of these events our district over head were notified of our current situation.","08/10/2020 10:34"

At approximately 1000 hr. the helicopter on pad #1 started to turn rotors to lift off the helibase for an assignment.  the helicopter was a type 1 helicopter having two rotors, one front and one back. From the security location to pad #1 the distance is approximately 250 to 300 ft.  The distance from the helibase access road, which passes in front of the landing pad, to the helicopter on the pad #1 appeared to be less than a 100 ft. roll of 1/2' hose.  So my concern was that of safety while rotors are turning on a pad and traffic is allowed to pass in front of the flight path for departure. As it did.<br/>When the vehicles approached my location I stopped them and informed them of the safety circle for a type 1 helicopter being at least 110 ft. around the helicopter while rotors are turning and asked that in the future if they see the rotors turning on pad #1 to stop and allow the helicopter to lift or shut down.  I entered the encounter on my unit log.<br/>At 1530 hrs. the helicopter on pad #1 was spooling up for lift off. As the Deck Coordinator approached from the road he stopped to allow the helicopter to continue with its mission.  As he was waiting, I approached him, shared the experience of this morning and asked he could talk to the helibase manager to remind the crews of the safety circle around helicopters especially at or near pad #1. I entered the conversation in my unit log. <br/>As the day ended, there were no more incidents near pad #1. When I turned in my unit log I mention the incident to my Security Manager.  He asked to be kept informed. <br/>On 06/22/20, at approximately 0745 the helicopter began to spool up. just prior to lift off, three vehicles pass in front of pad #1.  Two vehicles with helicopter crew members.  At approximately 1020, it returns to pad #1. At the same time, the Security Manager and the transitioning Security Manager pulled in to the security location at the helibase. As the helicopter is on the ground with rotors still turning three vehicles pass pad #1 from helibase. When they approached my location I stop the lead vehicle and mentioned my concern with traffic passing in front of pad #1 while rotors are spinning. They tell me that a woman at the other end waived them through. I share with the Security Managers that this has been happening and that I have documented it in my ICS-214's. They ask what have I done and I share that I passed my safety concern on to the deck coordinator but never heard anything back. The transitioning Security Manager is upset and goes to the helibase to share what he has just witnessed.<br/>1050 hrs. HBMG and DECK approach me at security location and asks why he was not approached with the safety concern.  I explained the I passed it on to his DECK yesterday.    <br/>At 1730 the new DECK approached the security location and we spoke. she stated she agreed on the safety concern and we agreed to a procedure when rotors are turning to hold traffic. <br/>No other issues that day.<br/>06/23/20, when I relieved the night shift security, I notice that the helicopter appeared to be set back a little further from the access road.","* When I noticed the safety concern I reported it to the helibase using the chain of command.

We have had active fires when this has happened in the past and have had to run our center off cell phones.<br/><br/>I placed tickets on 6/13, 7/1, 7/5, and 11/18 this year for the same phone issue and 2 of them were picked up in a timely manner (talking hours, not days, still lagging behind the support we get from the Forest Service side).  My supervisor and the other assistant center manager have also placed tickets for our phones and had the same experience.  Other centers in the west have also had this experience which leads me to believe this is a systemic issue, and not a local phenomenon.  <br/><br/>As we move to Radio over IP, this is going to become even more critical as a vital link of communication as both the BLM radio and the phones will be on the same network - thus crippling both communication options in areas of our zone.  Having prompt access to troubleshooting, repair, and service becomes vital as we rely more on technology.","My supervisor and I sent emails to our FMO and District Manager, who forwarded our concerns on to BLM IT multiple times.  We have some people that we call, but right now those people are on details, etc.  I emailed the zone chief to see if I could get the ticket addressed.  <br/><br/>Proposed solution: Add a new ticket level to the Remedy system for dispatch tickets like the Forest Service did.  Communicate with Forest Service CIO to figure out what they did to address this problem, as it was a very large problem over there, and they addressed it properly and now it is no longer a problem.  On the forest service side - I call the help desk - press 1 for a Dispatch related issue, and then it gets elevated.","12/07/2020 14:22"

Soon after our arrival  the crew engaged on active fire edge well into the evening and did not return to the crew carriers until 2230. During this time the high temperature read 95 degrees Fahrenheit. In an effort to fight the fire aggressively having provided for safety first, the crew reengaged first thing in the morning just before 0700hrs in order to “beat the heat.” The Crew Boss Trainee and Superintendent submitted a General Message to division Zulu requesting 10 cubees, 10 MREs, 10 flats of Gatorade, and two flats of batteries at briefing, while the rest of the crew was engaged on the line. The forecasted high was 111 degrees but our weather observations found the high to be 103 degrees (in the shade). <br/><br/>The crew did not receive any resupply needs that were requested by the end of shift on 6/11. Instead the crew was told to fill off of a FWS hose spigot at ICP at the end of shift on 6/11 to resupply our cube need. Members of the incident management team directed all resources to use the aforementioned hose without providing any COVID-19 safety precautions.<br/><br/>The crew was released from incident the next morning, 6/12/2020 around 0800hrs. At this time the IMT was only able to restock the crew with MREs and no other items that were requested were filled.  It is worth mentioning the crew had completely depleted all Gatorade and most of our water supply  at this time.<br/><br/>While traveling to Tucson to preposition, the Superintendent received a call from the Logistics Section Chief, letting him know that the water we had filled contained coliform bacteria and was not safe to drink. By this time ALL but three members of our crew consumed anywhere between a half liter to two liters of this water.","1. In an effort to “beat the heat” the crew hit the line early allowing us to produce and secure critical areas of line before the hottest and driest hours of the day. As a result, the line was secured by the hottest part of the day.<br/>2. Every hour, two to four crew members were given a five to ten minute break in the shade. This gave them proper time to hydrate with fluids and electrolytes, while also allowing time to cool the body and prevent against an HRI. This is one of the reasons we went through so much water.<br/>3. Even though no direction was given to help mitigate against COVID-19 while filling water, the crew had used our water fillers (supt/crew boss trainee) to fill the water. In addition, the water source was handled with gloves and sanitized  by our crew before use. Furthermore, the same two individuals also receive crew meals, transport trash, and handle/transfer of goods and materials between crowded spaces and the crew. By doing this we are able to limit exposure of the whole crew in areas where larger groups of people congregate. <br/>4. After being notified of our contaminated water, all water on the crew was disposed of and new cubees were obtained and filled in Tucson.","06/17/2020 15:49"

Our radio bank on the forest contains a primary command channel (North Repeat for north zone, South Rpt for South zone) which is used for all LEO traffic and emergency responses, Admin, resource tracking for all resources, fire response, primary Fire Command for all initial attack fires, daily staffing/ line up, daily weather and status checks.<br/><br/>Over the last several years our LEO traffic has become increasingly more frequent due to the much higher public visitation rates on our forest. There is now more than ever a need for a minimum of 2 different Repeater channels on the Inyo National Forest- to improve employee and public safety- our current system jeopardizes the lives of our LEOs, Fire personnel and other field personal. <br/><br/>In the last 3 years, with this year being the icing on the cake, there has been daily competition for radio use between adjoining forces. This has happened during confirmed fires and fire responses on the North repeat command and South Rpt command. <br/><br/>One fix for this is to permanently switch all Admin and LEO Traffic to our pre-existing and non utilized command frequency called “SERVICE NET” and keep North Repeat and South Repeat for all Fire personnel tracking, response and primary command channel for new starts- in the rare event a second command is needed for an incident or multiple incidents we can always clear service net for that incident should the need arise . <br/><br/>There’s several different ways to organize 2 separate command channels and that can be worked out in the future. I am merely just bringing up the need that LEO and Fire need two separate command frequencies. Fire should not have to compete with LE check backs and responses and vice versa. It’s a major safety concern to Our LEOs and Firefighters and needs to be corrected.","Myself and many others have brought the issue up in the past during end of the season AAR's but this is generally described as too hard of a task to complete, or perhaps not taken seriously. The result is nothing is done to correct the action from our management. My hope is that this report is taken seriously as constructive criticism, this is not intended to place blame on management or anyone else. The intent here is to see an honest attempt made to resolve this on going and worsening problem. Thank you.","09/29/2020 14:44"

The unit consisted of Rocky Mountain Juniper and the project work was to lop and scatter the juniper. Tree size ranged from seedling size to mature Juniper approximately 18 inch DBH. Topography on the site consisted of rolling terrain with some of the steeper slopes of 30%. This project is expected to last throughout the field season. <br/><br/>This was the crew member's first day cutting on the project for the season. The crew member has been with the engine module for the past few seasons and has operated a chainsaw while with the module. Other members on the crew have been cutting on the project site the previous week. The Crew member was an A Faller (FAL3). The crewmember was limited on their falling experience and was cutting next to a B faller (FAL2).  <br/> <br/>With the arrival of a new member to the project a Tailgate safety briefing was conducted with the JHA. Proper PPE was discussed and all personnel were wearing chainsaw operations PPE. One of the safety issues discussed was the fact that crew members have not run a chainsaw in several months and slower production was expected on the first few shifts on the project while personnel reacquainted themselves with chainsaw operations. The fuels reduction prescription was outlined and discussed. Then personnel proceeded to cut for the day.<br/><br/>The crew member voluntary decided to wear line gear while cutting. This was not discussed at the briefing. <br/><br/>When limbing a fallen juniper on a 20% slope the crew member sliced the top of his left boot with the tip off the chainsaw bar. The Crew member stated they lost awareness of foot placement and had their left foot on the uphill side. The cut to the logger style boot is approximately 2 inches long. The crew members sock had fibers pulled from it. The saw tip did not injure the crew member.","Once the incident occurred, the crew member ceased sawing and immediately informed the crew Forman whom the crew member was working next too.

The existing generator has been broken for over a year.<br/>During the course of the 8 hour outage, one smoke report happened which the Dispatcher had to move to the Moab Operations Center and dispatch from a mobile radio. The only available repeaters during the power outage were Moab BLM, Monticello BLM and maybe Tavaputs repeater from the Moab Operations Center or from the Moab Field Office.<br/>The power outage affects radio coverage for the entire Moab Fire Zone. The radios are out for the ENTIRE fire dispatch zone and no Forest Service or National Park Service repeaters are available for the entire zone.<br/>The back up generator that has been down for over a year powers the dispatch center and the communication room next to the radio tower. <br/>The communication room houses all of the radio infrastructure for NPS, BLM and FS as it applies to Moab Fire Center radios.","Immediate action taken was to report to the Fire Management Group via text and phone call. Phone calls were also made to the radio technicians for BLM and USFS. <br/>Emails were sent out advising everyone of power outage and time frames involved.<br/>No immediate solution to replacing the backup generator is available because of the infrastructure involved.<br/>Replacing a back up generator source will take more than one week.

Since the conversion to the USFS network, we have had several radio issues that are continually impacting our day-to-day workload to communicate with field-going employees for saw projects and initial attack fire activity.<br/><br/>The previous SafeNet ID #20200210-0001 addressed and resolved some issues.<br/><br/>The radio issues that we have been experiencing are as follows:<br/><br/>1) May 31st @ 2034- Dispatcher arrived in the dispatch office to dispatch engine to smoke report in the Fort Howes area. Dispatcher was able to receive the engine traffic on BLM-Home Creek & Gardner Butte, but the dispatcher's communication was not transmitting out. <br/><br/>The Dispatcher tried other south repeaters (i.e. USFS and State of MT) with no luck. Dispatcher restarted USFS radio consoles, Telex ADHB4s and IP-223s with no luck. <br/><br/>Dispatcher moved to the Miles City Air Base (COO Plan) and was unable to transmit out. <br/><br/>Dispatcher contacted BLM and USFS Radio Technicians.<br/><br/>2)  May 28th - National Flight Following, Simplex and North Repeaters were not receiving and/or transmitting. BLM Radio technician reset TELEX IP-223 and TELEX IP-224. This issue occurs weekly, but the most recent date was May 28th.<br/><br/>3) BLM-Pine Grove repeater is working but only for a 5-miles radius. Miles City Dispatch unable to access. This repeater is a critical need for radio coverage in the Missouri Breaks.<br/><br/>4) USFS network requires radio desktops to be restarted for updates. These computers should not require software updates as they are radios. Network updates required the computers to be restarted, which prohibits radio communication from occurring.<br/><br/>Our dispatch center has always had radio issues due to aging infrastructure and power outages, but these recent issues are directly impacting the Communication in LCES as we don't have cell coverage across the majority of our response areas.<br/><br/>Our 2019 National Preparedness Review findings addressed many other radio issues, but these issues have surfaced since that review in June 2019.<br/><br/>We have submitted an unfunded needs request for the Eastern Montana/Dakotas District to get the support that our boots on the ground need and deserve.","1) Dispatcher was able to set up communication through the Diamond Butte lookout which is staffed by a BLM employee. Lookout was able to talk to the engine on Scene of Action, then call Dispatcher on landline.<br/><br/>June 1st @ 0600 - Radios were up and working without issues. Unknown if any additional actions were taken by radio technicians.<br/><br/>2) BLM Radio Technician had to troubleshoot the issue for almost 5 hours.<br/><br/>3) Portable repeater has been set up for Miles City Dispatch to access the BLM-Pine Grove repeater.

We chose the latest generations of the USFS national standards to put into the pumping practical portion of the academy.  These models are the Model 346, BME built and have the Freightliner chassis.<br/> <br/>While pumping these engines for the last ten days, we are starting to see a “high idle” mode the truck puts itself into.  This mode affects the pump side of the truck as well.  Once the high idle mode starts itself, the pump side of the truck generates approximately 90 extra PSI while the pump is engaged.  So for instance, if a student is pumping during their practical and the engine goes into high idle, the PDP the student has set on the pressure gauge is off by the 90 PSI the high idle creates.  So, if the pump is set at 150 PSI, and the high idle kicks in, we now see 240 PSI on the pressure gauge and that pressure is sent to the nozzle at the end of the hoselay.<br/> <br/>We have been testing two of these trucks for the last ten days.  One truck will allow the pump operator to engage the PTO at high idle.  The other one will not allow the PTO to engage during high idle.<br/><br/>This unforeseen rise in pressure of approximately 90 PSI poses a serious risk to the operator and nozzle person. The other risk is the inability to engage the PTO for water deliver.","This issue has been attempted to be remedied through computer programming to no effect. We tried to set max high idle, observed to see if it was exhaust regeneration which was verified not to be the case. Applying the foot brake prevented the high idle but would return to high idle once the brake pedal was released. Cruise control was not engaged. This would also occur when pump was engaged and RPMs were increased at the pump control panel during pumping operations. All options were exhausted and ultimately the engines were taken out of service for pumping.","03/09/2020 14:19"

We are also unable to obtain a loaner radio. Having enough functioning handheld radios for the module is essential to operational safety. Currently the engine has only three KNG radios, which we are being told by the radio tech are the only approved handhelds for fireline use.","The FEO put in a CIO Help Desk ticket #REQ000001399940 on 1/9/20 which was closed without resolution.

I spoke to the forest radio tech today (3/18/20), and was told the radio was irreparable. He also stated that due to current USDA-FS CIO policy and radio ordering processes there is no way to replace the radio for another 7 years or so due to radio lifespan and limitations on the number of radios on the unit, and that there is no loaner radios available. There is no way to purchase another radio at this time without violating policy. So in short CIO policy and procedure is putting firefighter safety at risk.

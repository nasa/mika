What was most troublesome is that the strategic objective of smoke reduction was","-The fuels were extremely dry with 1000 hour fuel moistures of 6%.

-The 30-mile drive along the road was sometimes hazardous with fast moving traffic from the opposite direction. On 11/02/01, the Crew was demobed from the fire and reassigned to a prescribed fire on a National Forest. Our objective, as stated at morning briefing on 11/03/01 was to reduce the output of smoke that the burn was producing. The team was vague on how to accomplish this task. Local resources that had worked this fire on previous shifts told us that numerous fire orders and watchout situations had been violated in previous shifts. The team was well aware of these violations and still decided to place us into the following situations:

*Broken Standard Fire Order

-Determine safety zones and escape routes: We were able to identify only one safety zone within the burn unit and this was on our last shift. Our escape routes consisted of an extended hike (30 to 60 min.) to an established trail and back to where our rigs were parked.

*Broken Watchout Situations are as follows:

3. Safety zones and escapes routes not identified: See above Broken Fire Order.

4. Unfamiliar with weather and local factors influencing fire behavior: Although a few of us were quite familiar with this particular fuel model, an FBAN was never a part of the management organization. This in addition to the unreliable spot weather forecasts made for some confusion when fire behavior did increase.

8. Constructing fireline without safe anchor point: We always tried to anchor to existing black but don't think it really mattered with all of the surrounding unburned fuel.

9. Building fireline downhill with fire below: We knew for sure that there were a lot of spot fires below us as we worked our way from the top down.

11. Unburned fuel between you and the fire: The biggest concern was all of the little spot fires we were passing up to go after the biggest smokes or the ones that we weren't seeing as we were going further downhill away from our rigs. There was no specific event that rose from this incident. It was the blatant disregard for fundamental guidelines and rules in wildland incident management for nothing more than political and economic reasons that lead to such an unsafe working environment. It seems very hypocritical that the same safety rules pushed without room for discussion at the beginning of every season by supervisory and overhead personnel are thrown to the side when it is either inconvenient or mandated by there supervisors.","Even though we should have turned down the assignment outright, we believed that we could accomplish the task safely and effectively. On our own, we posted multiple lookouts throughout the operation and set trigger points. Good communication was established and we assessed the comfort level of our crewmembers though we could, and ultimately did accomplish the assigned task, it was still the wrong thing to do. We accept as much responsibility as we place on the team and their supervisors. It set a bad precedent for all and if asked to do it again, we would not hesitate to say no.  All fire personnel should stick to their guns when it comes to safety. Crew bosses must turn down such assignments in the future. The priority should shift away from political agendas and back to the men and women on the line.","11/09/2001 00:00"

Upon noticing that the two lead instructors of 2 classes were wearing jeans instead of Nomex pants, I alerted the Safety Officer. (Having worked in Colorado at the CO Wildfire Academy with the same two instructors before as a SOT3 trainee, I have seen their excellent teaching capabilities in the past and was, therefore, surprised by their lack of proper PPE.)

The Safety Officer then told the 2 instructors, and the lead instructor came over to me and demanded why I had questioned his PPE. He said that he had left home in a rush and had forgotten his Nomex pants. (I asked myself, why did he remember the rest of his gear and why had the other instructor forgotten her/his Nomex pants as well?) He then said that he was just planning to observe and not get near the fireline. It seems that it would have been difficult for the two instructors not to be involved with their students. I asked him what if there were to be an escape, wouldn't he feel obligated to assist? He said that others could handle it. (I asked myself why he had the rest of his gear on if he had no intention of participating?)

I then noticed that the Safety Officer to whom I had originally spoken only had Nomex pants and boots on, and no other PPE.

There is an issue with our engine crew that does not seem to be getting dealt with locally, so I thought I'd give this a try. In the early morning of 10/24/01, two people on the crew were arrested for drunk driving and possession of cocaine and marijuana. It was off the clock, but they could have gotten a call or come in to work still intoxicated (we are burning right now, so there was a chance they could have been called in on that day to burn). As a fellow firefighter, this concerns me. How do we know they aren't doing this on the job? And they give our Parks a bad name. It is their first season on and they are to be layed off on or around 11/02/01, so it sounds like the solution going around is: They are going to be gone next week anyway... My problem with this is, they will not get drug tested, there is a high possibility of our burn continuing (in which they will be on), and what happens if they get rehire rights? If they get away with this, they'll think they're invincible. The issue is clear--it is unsafe to have firefighters out there on drugs. I have seen several firefighters over the years get busted for using drugs and get away with it, most of them got promoted. This is dangerous and something needs to be done about it. How would you feel if your son/daughter was killed from a negligent drug abuser driving a fire engine? You are supposed to feel safe when firefighters are around and trust that they can help you, not run you over! There are also safety issues with their personal health. If they are on drugs, they can't be in top shape and are at a higher risk for heart attacks. Engines in the Parks are the water support on our burns, as well as support on Search and Rescues, how can they do these jobs if they are not at 100%?","I know it might not be possible, but random drug tests throughout the summer might scare people. They are normally only given at the beginning of the summer, so people feel safe--how is that random?  Immediate drug testing for the entire crew (maybe all of Fire Management) without warning. I also suggest that they be fired (if this is legally possible, which it should be because they work for the government and drugs are illegal on or off the clock) and used as an example that drug use will not be tolerated in the fire community. A more accessible substance abuse program would also be in order.","10/25/2001 00:00"

I was extended initial attack. When I showed up, I tied in with engine (x) and started to suppress the southwest line of the fire, near the point of origin. Immediately I was contacted by the I.C. and was asked to tie in with the rurals. After driving around, searching for about 5 minutes, I contacted the I.C. to confirm their location. He informed me that they were protecting several different structures and were moving around a lot, and to go back and tie in with engine (x) again. Engine (x) informed me that the fire was pushing against a small canal on the south side and that a haystack and some structures were being threatened. Engine (x) asked me to find an entrance, on the other side of the canal, and to catch any spot fires that jump the canal. The wind direction, at this time, was erratic but mainly from the northwest. I found an access and immediately noticed a spot fire and proceeded to suppress it. It was right next to the canal, where there was a narrow, sandy road, to gain access at. I shifted into 4 wheel drive, because I figured that the road would be soft, and also, that is what we are trained to do when we are off the main road. The spot extinguished quickly. It was also next to a tree and some shrubs, and I could not see around them for other spot fires. I radioed to Engine (x), who was just across the canal, to the north, and asked him to be a lookout for me. Engine (x) worked his line ahead about 40 yards as I stayed to mop up the spot. Engine (x) radioed to me and informed me of a spot fire ahead of me about 100 yards near the road that followed the canal. I confirmed and proceeded to bump up the road, with my partner walking and checking for spots as we came upon the spot. We proceeded to attack the fire, but it became too intense, so I yelled to my partner to back me up to get out of the intensity of the fire. My escape route was, to either drive down the road to the black, or back up by the hay stack where and get on the road. At this time, the smoke had eliminated my escape route forward, so I fell back to backing up. The fire became even more intense because the fuels were so thick and volatile, approximately 10 foot high choke cherry brush. I yelled to my partner to get in, and I continued to back up. I made it out of immediate danger. Just then, the sandy road gave away under my right rear dual and I got stuck in the sand and brush on the south side of the road, opposite of the canal. My truck was nearly in the middle of the choke cherry brush that the fire was spreading into. I then realized that we were in danger. I radioed to Engine (x) for assistance, engaged the parking brake, left the engine idling, and we both exited the driver's door. We grabbed our 10 ft, 1 1/2' hose and attempted to suppress the blaze, which, by this time, was about 15 feet from the truck. Engine (x) parked next to me, just across the canal, threw this hard line across the canal to my partner, and hooked up his 100 ft. 1 1/2 hose and began to attempt suppression from across the canal. I yelled across to Engine (x) to get air attack over here, because I knew we had at least one helicopter and several tanker planes on this fire. We had three nozzles attempting suppression with little effect on the flames. Moments later, the driver from Engine (x) yelled to me, from across the canal, that there was another spot fire back behind, where I had just come from, about 50 yards. I looked at the other spot and noticed that it was very intense already and racing towards us. I told my partner to keep spraying with Engine (x)'s hose and shut mine down and jumped into the truck. I shifted into 4 low, released the parking break and attempted to drive in front of the fire into the fresh black area. I didn't get 5 feet until the truck nearly rolled over. The brush and smoke impaired my vision from seeing how steep and rocky the embankment really was. I engaged the parking break, left in gear, and killed the engine. I then climbed out of the window, jumped to the road and grabbed the drip torch to attempt the engine protection drill. As I was assembling the torch, I yelled across to Engine (x), once more, to get air attack over here. They yelled back to inform me that they were not answering. He continued to suppress from across the canal, my partner was still spraying and I hurriedly attempted to assemble the drip torch. I looked towards the spot fire and noticed that it was getting extremely close and intense. The drip torch was taking too long, so I set it aside, grabbed and lit a fusee and attempted to burn around my engine. Nothing around the truck would ignite, so I threw the fusee into the brush towards the spot fire. The two spot fires had now married together and were getting very intense, and were right up against the truck. I yelled to my partner to get across the canal to Engine (x). I waited to see if he had made it okay, and I jumped in and proceeded to the other side and met up with Engine (x). Just as I crossed the canal, I looked back to my truck and saw flames protruding through the cab and that the tires were already igniting. I, along with the crew of Engine (x), proceeded to unhook his 1 1/2' hose and reeled up his hardline. After the last bit of hose was reeled up, I did a quit check to see if everyone was accounted for, and we drove down the road until it came to a dead end, about 200 yards. There we had wet down the area around the truck and waited out the smoky conditions there. We contacted the I.C. confirming that everyone was okay and accounted for. From the time I got stuck until we were safely waiting it out with Engine (x), was about 3-4 minutes. There were no injuries of any kind during this ordeal.","I could have possibly backed up to where the spot fire was, and that could have eliminated backing up in the tense situation.

My crew and I arrived at the Hyampom fire in Hayfork CA on 9/1/01. First shift was 9/2/01. We were assigned to division (1) under DIVS (1).

The first shift consisted of waiting on a ridge top for an opportunity to advance. That opportunity never came. We were over run by a 200-foot wall of fire and retreated to the safety zone. The rest of the day was spent mopping up the slop over the ridge.

Day two, 9/3/01: We were assigned to the same division, same supervisor. He asked me to wait and instruct two of the type 2 crews #2 and #4 who had not been into this division before.

When we arrived at the drop point #6, he instructed the three crews to take care of two slopovers on the line. My crew and I started a hose lay into the bottom.

I looked over the map and terrain and didn't see any place for a safety zone. I asked the DIVS (1) where the safety zone was, and he said there were no safety zones, just deployment zones, which was the cat line on a ridge with preheated fuels and a preburned chimney on BOTH sides of the dozer line.

We started into the second slopover and the other crews wouldn't follow. An engine crew helped my crew drop the hose lay into the slopover. We did not have hardware for laterals so the hose lay was useless. I discussed the situation with the engine boss and we decided to back out because the LCES was non-existent. The engine boss called the DIVS (1) and told him we were backing out. He wanted us to stay anyway. We didn't. He insisted the danger was not as great as it seemed. Not true. They were making tanker runs right over our heads 10'-15' and the helicopters worked constantly for the whole shift. (If the danger wasn't all that great why the million-dollar air show over us?)

Later I saw the DIVS (1) and explained why I wouldn't take my crew into the canyon. He said fine, you stay up here where you feel safe and he would take care of it by himself.

After shift, two of my squad bosses (both Crew Boss qualified), and myself went to safety and made our complaints, about how LCES was not intact at all, throughout the day on our Division.

The next day our DIVS (1) called my Squad bosses and myself together to 'clear up' the rumors that we reported him. I told him that we indeed had. He was mad and said he should kick us off his division and send us home. The next day all of the crews that wouldn't go into that hole had a

'Requested: demobe. (9/5) There were 2 other Type 2 crews involved.

C: There was little to no communication because of the noise level of the retardant drops and helicopters. My crew was hit three times with retardant, with NO warning because we could not hear due to the noise level. Additionally we tried to radio our DIVS with no luck. He never answered.

E: There was no escape route. A safety zone should be reached within minutes, and you should be able to stand within that zone, without deploying a fire shelter. There is no 'D' in LCES.","LCES must strictly be followed.

-	the tree that blew over was a green tree with a full crown

-	two of the lateral roots had burned out, and the species had no deep taproot.

The swamper was a member of crew-1 working on this section of the line. As the swamper was running to get out of the way, he tripped, falling alongside the tree that was just cut. This prevented the swamper from being hit directly, however, he was brushed by limbs knocking his hardhat off. He was uninjured.

Fuel was dense subalpine fur. It was a transition into a new team the day the problem occurred. Mop-up operations had been going well with the crews mopping up 500'+ into the interior of the fire. The team decided to increase mop-up efforts by using helitack to hit hot spots in the interior of the burned area. Apparently, there was a mix up in directions given to the pilots as to where these 'random' drops were going to occur. With directions that were unclear some drops began to occur in areas where the hand crews where mopping up. With little notification of these drops and some in near proximity to the crews I pulled the crews out until the situation was clarified. After the drops and pulling out of the crews I was told that no more drops would occur until after 1800 when the crews would be off the line. After the crews were put back onto the line I went and talked to each of the crew bosses individually to see how close some of the drops were to them, not being on site when the drops were actually occurring. Some were with a couple hundred feet of the crews and being in tall timber (sub alpine fur environment) I believe that these drops had posed a hazard to the crews and thus warranted me pulling them back to a safer position. The other deciding factor was when I heard one of the pilots say, ' Hey, there are some yellow shirts down there I am not going to drop in this area.' The incident that really warrants this testimony is the fact that while talking to the crew bosses, after I was told these 'random' drops would stop, another drop came down on top of us right where the crew was working. This one just missed the dead top of a living tree by 15-20 feet. All I can say is what if! ?

Fire burning on both sides of Highway 97 in desert shrub, catclaw, and mesquite, forcing temporary closure of highway. No communication link with engines enroute, or dispatch during HAZMAT situation. Department of Transportation reported a fully engulfed vehicle on Hwy 97 to the Dispatch Center. The vehicle was carrying Acetylene cylinders, which were venting, and exploding causing the fire to spread into the wildlands on both sides of the highway, forcing the temporary closure of Highway 97.

Upon arrival, I tried to contact my chase truck, and the second engine enroute to tell them to hold back a safe distance until I had a chance to tie in with DPS, Fire Department, or until I had a chance to determine there was no more threat from the acetylene. My chase truck was less than two miles behind me, and the second engine was 20 minutes out. When I had no luck contacting them by radio, I tried Dispatch on our repeater channel, and cell phone with no luck.

In the end, the Fire Department had control of the vehicle fire, and we were able to come in and work the wildland fire with no problems. However, in a situation that has the potential such as this (Congested traffic due to closure of Highway, and a fully involved vehicle carrying these materials, that were exploding) communications is vital. If the situation with the vehicle was still out of control upon our arrival, we could have had a pile-up of our firefighters in an area where they would have been at risk, all because our radios do not allow us to talk to each other unless its line of site.

Because we had no communications with our Dispatch while on scene, we had to break away one of our firefighters to drive up the road and act as a human repeater. The only place we could find to get out to Dispatch with radios, or cell phone, did not allow contact with the firefighters. We find ourselves in a position where we have more firefighters in place as human repeaters along a busy highway, than we have on the fireline.

This is a continuing problem with our radio system throughout our district, and this is one example of the problems that we are faced with.","","08/28/2001 00:00"

- The topography was steep mountain slopes, grass and sagebrush vegetation in very dry conditions.

- Communications between th","Weather conditions were hot, dry. Fuels were grasses, sagebrush, greasewood, other shrubs and bushes. Terrain was steep rocky slopes, many ravines and washes. The major concern is the problem of having “public’s' in and around the staging area, or even around the fire complex. Without a PAO or a designated individual to control the media, permittees, adjacent landowners, and other individuals with concerns about the fire; public safety and the safety of the firefighters become in question with these folks running around. The IC of a fire has enough to worry about, without having to run around trying to fine out 'who went where'. On August 16, 2001 on the Morgan Mountain fire, a local Television reporter arrives on the fire wanting information about the fire from a BLM Dozer operator. The operator told the reporter to proceed to the fire staging area and talk to the fire IC. Apparently this reporter did not want to wait for the fire IC at the staging area so he started up one of the dirt roads that forked off of the staging area. This road was being used as a fire line. The reporter proceeded up the fire-line road (which had turned into a dozer fire line). The reporter then preceded down the fire line which transverse the mountain and was cut through a small ravine. Once in the ravine, the reporter must have realized that he could not precede any further. There the reporter tried to get out of the area, attempted to turn around and drove parallel with the slope, stopped and rolled his vehicle over.

The main issue was that the fire in this area had started to flare up once again and crews were preparing to actively fight the fire in this area. The reporter not only put himself into danger, but also the engine crew that went to assist this person.","The main problem as I see it, is that nobody from the fire stopped this individual before he started on the fire line. Any firefighter that sees an individual, who is not a part of fire operations, should be stopped and escorted away from the fire operations area. I know that fire crews are focused on the fire and it's activity and that it's not their job to question everyone that travels the fire line, but someone should have stepped forward and stopped this individual.

The only other problem is that someone should have stayed with the reporter until the IC got to the site. But this is a staffing problem and having someone available to do the task is not always possible.  At the beginning of the fire season, PAO's send out letters to the local media, business groups, associations and other groups if interested constituents explaining the protocol that is followed on the fire operations. Maybe holding a 'Evening' course on how to get information during the fire season, who to contact and why it's important to follow protocol for the safety of public individuals and for the safety of the firefighters.

Ensure IC's and Engine Foreman are aware of their role when media arrives at a fire scene and PAOs are not available.

The team's inability to deal with issues raised by different crews without becoming confrontational contributed to a rapid decline in the morale of the camp, and eroded any confidence in the overhead team.

The caterer was substandard, and the issue was slow to be dealt with.

We were supporting a burnout operation with engine-xx in heavy oak brush and grass when the sediment bowl on the rear of the air tank was forcefully removed. It is unknown what caused this, but heavy brush is suspected. The result was rapid loss of nearly all air pressure to the braking system. At the time of the mishap, the driver was wearing his seat belt, had a spotter in front of the truck, and was in possession of a valid CDL driver’s license. Upon loosing air pressure the truck began a rapid down hill decent. The driver had the fore thought to realize that there was only enough air pressure remaining for one attempt at stopping. He steered the truck to the best of his ability to a safe spot away from the advancing flame front. He then stopped the truck using the remaining air pressure and steering into the curb. He immediately applied the parking brake, chocked the wheels and left the tires pointed into the curb. The driver was shook-up, but uninjured.

Fire activity at the time was highest at the western, southwestern and northwestern flanks and within a few interior islands on the west side. Fire behavior included fire smoldering and creeping under the brush in grass and occasional torching of individual trees. During previous operational periods the fire behavior was similar at about 10 AM and increased throughout the day.

The fire was approximately 70% contained; the much of the western flank was still not under containment. Fuels were brush and grass including Mesquite, Ironwood, Salt Cedar, creosote and annual grasses. Fuels were dense in many areas and the fire contained many unburned or partially burned islands of fuel.

Road conditions within the fire itself were fair to poor with areas of deep sand and occlusion by brush over growth. The incident in question was overhead reporting to the fire ground without checking in with the IC and without PPE or obtaining frequencies to communicate with fire personnel. The fire had started on the Phoenix FO and had burned over the FO boundary onto Yuma. We completed gathering GPS data on the fire the previous evening and the map was available the morning of the 16th. On the morning of 8/16/01 the fourth operational period on the Caliente Fire I was told that a representative may be arriving from Yuma FO sometime to check the location of the fire with a GPS unit. I had not received any information at the time as to whom or their ETA.

At 9:45 the State Rep was checking the road at the fire perimeter on the Northwestern flank, the perimeter was cold in the immediate area but active further west and south. The State Rep called to report a BLM vehicle parked at the gate and an individual with a GPS unit, he asked if it was someone from our office I told him no and asked him to make contact. He did so and found the individual attempting to start an ATV at the fire perimeter. The State Rep showed him the GPS map of the fire. He then helped the individual load his ATV and accompanied him off the fire. When he reported this to me I went to meet with the individual as he was not in contact with the fire by radio, had not checked in and was not wearing the appropriate PPE for the fireline. I contacted AZ-PHD dispatch to determine if they had been notified that an individual was enroute to the fire by YFO dispatch had received an ETA or had been contacted directly. Dispatchers reported they had received a call from Yuma 5 minute’s prior requesting an updated Lat and Long for the fire but no information on an individual en route or at the fire. The AZ-PHD dispatchers knew as I did that a representative from Yuma may be expected sometime that day.

Upon meeting with the individual we went over the map of the fire and discussed the acreage breakdown to see if it would meet his needs. I then discussed the appropriate SOPs for reporting to a fire regarding checking in with the IC, obtaining frequencies for the incident and wearing the appropriate PPE for an uncontrolled fire. The individual reported that he had been asked by fire management to check the fire with his GPS but had not received information on frequencies or contacts. He had noticed the smoke columns from two flare-ups on the southwestern perimeter. The individual reported that he was red carded, having gone through the training earlier that year. He was a contract employee working for the Yuma office.

The safety issues involve the lack of appropriate communication and equipment for the fireline and the fact that no one knew the individual was on or in the vicinity of the fireline until he was discovered by fire personnel. This fire had experienced spotting and flare ups throughout the incident on the perimeter and within islands and heat related injuries were of high concern. The individual was on the fireline without the benefit of proper equipment, communication and a briefing on the fire and associated hazards.

These safety violations had the potential to place the individual in an extremely dangerous situation. The situation may have been grave if the individual was not discovered when he was.

The incident was discussed on 8/17/01 with the AFMO from the Yuma FO and he concurred with our concerns.","Individuals reporting to a fire should receive the appropriate frequencies and contacts for the incident and contact the IC upon arrival just as if they were ordered. When sending individuals to a fire in overhead roles or as an agency rep, the sending dispatch should notify the appropriate dispatch center or incident commander with an ETA, method of contact and contact name. These are standard SOPs for reporting to an incident. Personnel reporting to a fire should wear and have available the appropriate PPE for their mission.  See Above.","08/17/2001 00:00"

The TFL and the crew bosses went to a safe vantage point and watched the situation for about an hour, and still did not feel comfortable going in. At this time I called the branch ops and suggested that we bring our crews around from the bottom and start there. He did not like this idea. I also informed him that we had a spot fire and were working on that. Branch Ops said not to disturb the site and asked if I was a trained fire investigator. Later he told me that the spot could not possibly been caused by embers from the main fire, but must have been caused by a cigarette from one of the shots. The shot supervisor informed me that no one on his crew smokes.","The planning and operation people need to listen to the crews when a safety concern is voiced.

We encountered a lot of the same problems on our fire. Camp was inadequate in all ways, and briefings were poorly thought out and non-informing. The team in charge of this fire were unprepared for the amount of resources that were ordered. I and others feel that these problems should be brought forward and taken care of, the safety and well being of the crews working these fires should be, no, HAS TO BE the number one concern on larger project fires. After spending five days at a fire camp our strike team of engines had quite a shock when we pulled into the fire camp. Camp already by this time was overcrowded, unsafe, and unsanitary. This by far has to be the worst fire camp I have ever stayed at. I have been told that they pride themselves on the fact that they do not have to contract out for their kitchen and shower facilities. After this incident I personally wish they would.

Safety concerns

1.	During morning briefings very little direction was given in our missions for the day. There were mornings when our strike team had not even been on the shift plan. And when we asked what we were supposed to be doing for the day we were told, “just go where you were yesterday and do the same thing”.

2.	Inadequate camp facilities

A} Lines for food were extremely long {up two hours wait}; this off time I would think should be spent sleeping. There were nights and mornings that people went with no food due to these lines and the fact that there were no seats to sit down and eat your meal. One kitchen unit is not sufficient to feed a camp that grew to over two thousand people.

B} Shower units were unsanitary, stalls were open with no curtains, drains were not placed correctly so urine and other bodily fluids flowed by your feet.

C} Not enough portable toilets for the resources present, our sleeping area had at least two hundred people and there were three toilets.

-This complaint is one of the biggest reasons for me to want to file this report-

These portable toilets were over used, filthy, and a very large health hazard. One of our crew people used one of these and she had forgotten to bring her flashlight. She had not lowered enough to touch the lid and still ended up with human feces on her. After showering she went directly to the medic tent where she was told there was nothing they could do for her. This to me is unacceptable and should not have happened.

D} Hand washing areas were made up of dirty black and brown stained basins that were shared by all.

3. Not enough lunches prepared for fire crews, some day’s lunches were not received until 3 o'clock in the afternoon

4. Not enough water provided, there were not enough water containers for the resources present during our first few shifts. And taking enough bottled water for the whole crew was not allowed.

5. During the first briefing we were told by the I.C. that there was no human resource specialist, so he would be the human resource specialist. As a large fire with multiple crews and agencies present, an agency representative should have been on site

6. Camp was spread out over a very large area; eating and showering units were on the top of a hill and very far from the sleeping areas.

7. Vehicles were allowed to park in sleeping areas.","When planning for fires and you have resources ordered. Support for these individuals should be in place before your suppression crews arrive.  Proper planning is my suggestion, large fires require a large amount of support, and the fire fighters needs should be number one on everyone’s list.

An upper level disturbance tracking across Northern California would produce extreme fire weather conditions. SW to W winds would increase with eye level gusts over 25 mph.

The Fire Behavior Forecast predicted humidity near 7%, with extreme burning conditions to start at 12:00 hours. The fire was expected to move in all directions with the anticipated weather. Spotting distances were predicted at 1/4 to 1/2 mile ahead of the fire when the wind surfaced. Numerous spots would combine at the head of the Blue Fire with the possibility of fire whirls.

The predominate fuel type was heavy mixed-conifer. The terrain includes steep slopes with rocky outcroppings.

Access is by narrow, one-lane roads dead-ending at the head of a chimney. At 1545 on August 12, 2001, an engine crew assigned to the Blue Complex on the Modoc National Forest, while mopping up the Sunflower Fire adjacent to the Blue Complex, had their primary escape route cut off by Blue Fire activity. The crew drove through multiple divisions on an actively burning 20,000-acre fire to reach their assignment, which was to check on a previously contained 1-2 acre fire. They did not make contact with operations personnel as they passed through active divisions. Within an hour and a half of working on the fire, conditions below the crew worsened and cut off their primary escape route. At that point they went to investigate, confirmed that their primary escape route had been indeed cut off. They then turned around to proceed in the opposite direction and discovered that it was a dead-end road (they had been previously advised that this was a through road). They then looked for a deployment zone, contacted the Forest dispatch office, removed their fire shelters from their cases, grabbed fuses, and prepared for possible deployment.

At that point Air Attack showed up, having heard the distress call, and immediately took action directing the crew to a nearby safety zone. Air Attack called in for helicopter bucket drops to slow the fire advance and also pulled in airtankers to pretreat the safety zone. Air Attack then decided to order a helicopter to extract the crew. The crew was transported to the Helibase.

Twenty-four hours later the fire had not advanced to the safety zone. The crew was flown into the extraction area and drove the engine back to the Incident Command Post.","1. Do not put crews at great risk to check previously contained fires that are within close proximity to large, advancing fires.

2. Ensure that fireline resources have received a current operational briefing.  1. All resources assigned to the fireline must obtain a shift briefing.

On 8/12 the Crew Boss refused an assignment for numerous safety concerns. The Crew was demobilized from the ongoing fire, and sent home with a poor performance rating that the Crew Boss refused to sign.

The Crew Boss notified me (Forest AFMO) during the demobilization process, though telephone communications were poor given the remote location of the ICP. The Crew Boss was experienced and well qualified; he has supervised numerous firefighting crews in a variety of wildfire situations. The Crew had successfully completed several shifts over the previous days. After counseling the Crew Boss via cell phone, I attempted unsuccessfully to contact the ICP.

1. Crew Bosses and all firefighters must understand how to refuse wildfire assignments for safety reasons in an appropriate manner.

2. Overhead and Incident Management Teams must understand how to appropriately deal with firefighters that refuse assignments for safety reasons, and develop options.

This resulted in confusion during the utilization of the Command Repeater frequency as both incidents were receiving each transmission on this freq. Identifiers were implemented (Fish Division C), but the problem culminated when a dozer rolled.

The terrain was rolling to flat in many areas, steep and rocky in other areas of the fire. Crew #1 (Type II) was assigned to Div. on the Sheep Fire on 08/12 to hold and hot spot indirect dozer line on a slop over during active lightning storms with ground strikes, toward and under active power lines, with active fire runs in progress. Crew Boss declined to deploy crew, as directed by DIVS, expressed his concerns about this and the ban on the tactical and safety use of fire at this time. Crew was later that day demobilized by the team for attitude of Crew Boss without reassignment possibilities. Paper documentation is available. In my opinion safety was compromised by a number of issues on this incident. We arrived on the afternoon of August 11th from Elko, NV. Staging. Enroute to the ICP, along the Izzenhhood Road, we encountered the DIVS-x for division on the incident. We introduced ourselves and asked if he could use assistance at this time. He directed us to check in at ICP and return, which we did. Upon return a plan was developed to burn out, with engine support, along an access road from an electronics site on the ridge above the road and eventually along Izzenhood Road itself. This task was completed with good effect and without incident. DIVSx then requested the crew-1 to work with crew-2 on a direct attack of the fire on the ridge above and trailing to the north of the electronic site. We began this operation with the crew-2, a CRWB, as a crew action. The ground became more rocky and difficult for direct action. CRWB, subject-1, my trainee, and I discussed this and requested a more indirect approach with fire support to secure line as we progressed from DIVS-x. We received permission, and with crew-1 leading, line was constructed and burn out begun. This worked well until the crews reached the base of the steepest area of the ridge. In this location the slope approached 60% and was rockslide talus and cheat grass. We planned to connect the grass stringers to the solid rock barriers with fire. This proved too difficult and no conventional handline was possible here. Subject-1 and the crew-2 Asst. had meanwhile stationed themselves as lookouts for both crews on the rock bluffs above. CRWB and I discussed the options and elected to call DIVS-x and tell him we could not go direct but, given the slope and prevailing wind, an indirect line lower on the ridge with a burn out behind could be done. This plan was put into effect with the crew-2 in the lead while I personally directed the fire operations. As evening approached the line construction progressed and the firing begun. We slowly fired sections of line down a sub ridge above a small drainage. Prior to finishing this DIVS wished firing operations stopped. We were about 40 feet from the bottom of the drainage and the other aspect where fire was still backing down the ridge. This was no so on the short section of line we held. The fire ran parallel to the line and threatened to hook below and make a full run at our line. I directed one crewmember to light 8 feet at a time to keep ahead of this fire behavior (crew member-1). This was done the next 40 feet to the drainage bottom whereby the effect of slope took over and further lighting was not needed at that time. I recount this entire incident to you the reader to set the tone for the next days' events. It was from this, I suppose, that the team came to believe I wished to utilize firing in any and all situations. We later in the evening extended the handline as the crew-2 was requested the climb the ridge and begin operations there. As we completed the line subject-1, acting as lookout, continued to monitor fire behavior. We requested the use of a dozer, but none were available, so we built more indirect handline with fire above us. We took the handline to a saddle that I knew a dozer could reach and hoped one could eventually arrive as the ground was excellent for dozer work. We returned along the finished line but some minutes later erratic down slope fire behavior began-about 2230 hrs. Our handline was soon compromised; we however were safely uphill with hard black a step away. DIVS-x requested both crews to return to vehicles, drive to the Izzenhood Road and prepare to make a stand along that road as the fire was now sweeping downhill along a large front.

During the next 2-3 hours extreme fire behavior was observed as flames reached the Izzenhood Road. Cut, dry hay and farm equipment was located on the other side of the road with farm structures beyond that. Crew deployment was impossible at first. I scouted the situation as the firefront passed to help determine if the fire had jumped the Izzenhood Road. It had not at that time. I made contact with night DIVS-y. After introductions he asked if my crew would be available at this time to burnout a remaining segment not ignited by the main fire. I also came into contact with the divisional Safety Officer who stated burning out was really what this team needed to consider. I tried to establish contact with the crew but the distance seemed too far. I was not overly concerned as subject-1 was left in charge and had proven herself a safe and capable crew boss on the previous fire. I reestablished contact only to find out that command had decided to retire the crews and equipment from the Izzenhood Road, it now being 0200. We were instructed to be available to work at 0800 since it was now quite late and the usual time was 0600 for shift change. We found the experiences of this day to be good in the sense that green firefighters had seen complicated and extreme fire behavior; we had from time to time discussed the 10/18 and applied them to this period. We were troubled by the tactics employed.

On the morning of the 12th, subject-1 and I acquired an Incident Action Plan, but had no briefing. We were told to report to Div.-xxx ASAP after breakfast. No tables or chairs were available at breakfast and lunches were not available but MREs were. As we departed camp the Fire Behavior Analyst gave us a paper copy of a Red Flag Warning just issued for the area. It included dry lightning forecast. Indeed we already observed downstrikes on the south end of the fire area. Shortly thereafter we made a call on the command frequency to ICP to report numerous downstrikes and cell movement. This was done enroute or at Drop Point 2-a point on the Izzenhood Road just outside of fire camp. Several bulldozers on lowboy trailers were in the area. We asked the operators why the dozers were here. They replied no dozer bosses were available the work with them. The IAP listed 4 DOZB on Div-xxx. In reality only one was there and he worked a 36+ hour shift. The IAP called for dozer construction along the power line right-of-way. An individual in Carson City BLM pick up directed us to proceed out toward the power lines and tie in with DIVS-z. Enroute the lightning activity continued and in fact, was approaching the divisional area.

Subject-1 and I discussed many of the previous days concerns and the situation we were approaching at this time. Crew safety was uppermost in my mind. As stated above DIVS requested an immediate crew deployment under the circumstances described above. I declined and stated I wish to go on record as protesting the ban on tactical fire use and for crew safety. I believe DIVS-z thought I wished to put fire on the ground at that time. Her evaluation states I was argumentative about this. I was deeply concerned about the overall lack of concern for firefighter safety based on the events of the previous night on this incident. My error was to express myself in this manner while others listened to the exchange between DIVS-z and I. It was at this point I realized firefighter safety was not the main concern of the team command personnel. DIVS-z suggested we deploy the crew on the other side of the slop over. I said that Subject-1 and I would scout this area, and if safe, do as instructed. We returned to our vehicle, but enroute to the other side of the slop over, had to park into the black of the original fire area because the fire within the slop over had turned 180 degrees and ran at the line. We waited this out in the vehicles. We deployed along this fire perimeter and proceeded to work the fire edge. The Safety Officer was on this area of the line during all of this time, but allowed other Type II crews to work under the power lines and out on the rocky outcroppings-areas we stated we would avoid. Shortly DIVS-z left the division without contacting any of the resources in place on the division. The Command repeater was also serviced and thus unavailable for use at this time. The aforementioned safety officer was acting DIVS. But forces were not informed. She was gone several hours. Again, I mention these events to call attention to the lack of consideration for firefighter safety.

In the early afternoon the crew-1 was requested to go to the ICP. Enroute we encountered thunderstorm mirco bursts that required a full stop of vehicles. Fortunately we were in the vehicles. Crewmembers from Crew-2 were caught in the open and at least one eye injury. At the ICP, subject-1 and I were conducted into an operations trailer. Present were 6 individuals, two of which I recognized-DIVS-z and the I.C.. DIVS-z stepped foreword and stated the crew was being demobed without the possibility of reassignment because of my attitude. I asked we be introduced to all present and discuss this situation. The following discussion centered around my attitude on the incident. I stated my responsibility was to return 20 people safely to Oregon and that if an attitude was present it was due to the events we had witnessed or situations we encountered while here. OPS trainee pointed out that I had no right to conduct myself as I had on the division when DIVS-z sought to deploy us. I stated I had the right to protect my crew, but upon reflection, conceded he was right to call me on the manner in which I did it. It became clear to me that the minds in that trailer were determined to get rid of us. I asked for the crew to be reassigned. I asked to be replaced as crew boss. Both options were denied. Subject-1 entered the discussion with her observations. Near the end of this the IC told us why the resource-cheat grass and sage- was so important in this area. I choose not to respond to this, but this statement made clear in my mind what was most important here and firefighter safety was not it. We left this meeting and conducted a conference call to Northeast Dispatch as to these events. I had left the meeting, with the intent of returning to it after this call, but all parties left the area except the Plans Chief. I said to him I wished to extend an apology to DIVS-z for the manner in which I choose to express myself, not the refusal to deploy. He replied she had returned to the line. I felt at this time, with little to lose, to tell him how I felt we were dealt with; that our concerns were unimportant and that a valuable resource-the crew-was being sacrificed. I also tried to point out the usual manner of employee relations-that mistakes occur but are not usually fatal. I likened the situation to a misdemeanor committed by me but 20 people suffered capitol punishment. He seemed unmoved and bored. I said you aren't listening and he replied, 'I hear you', but I felt otherwise. I terminated contact with the team at this point, intent on removing the crew away from here. We were allowed to demob and leave.","Utilize equipment and crew capabilities in combination to safely complete incident objectives, rather than singularly or sporadically.

A complete narrative text on cassette tape will be available to the Forest Safety Officer of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest.  I have no suggestions to offer that could mitigate these concerns.

First several days there was no coordination of ingress/egress of shifts going on/off the line resulting in traffic hazards on narrow road systems. Illogical allocation of resources between divisions, for example one small division had 23 engines on it one day, resulting in confusion and overlap, but not enough water tenders to support them.

Provided Gatorade type drinks in camp only to rehydrate, water only on line, but water supply was inadequate. I had to share my water with crews who were only given 1 cubie for the entire shift. Was told I would be personally charged $7.00 for a cubie if it wasn't returned. Was told I would be personally charged for a 1qt canteen if the canvas cover wasn't returned. Inordinate amount of time required to get basic supplies when the time would have been better spent sleeping. Example, a lengthy debate on whether or not earplugs should be signed out on the credit card. Long lines and waits for showers and meals, then had to stand to eat. Gym available for night shift to sleep in was way too hot. State showers were unsanitary. Crews were told they had used too much bottled water and no more would be available for the line. Water was to be obtained from the water buffalo. This was corrected after several cases of heat related illness. The long lines, scrutiny of every expense resulting in poor decisions and the extra hassle this caused line personnel was an extra burden that contributed to the overall health and well being of all. Inadequate food, water and rest created more fatigue than would normally be expected on a fire of this type.","Putting the health and welfare of personnel a higher priority than suppression costs.

Safety concerns were brought to the attention of Safety Officers, SOFR (T) on 08-16-01. This is a documentation of the concerns surrounding the fire during the dates of 08-05-01 thru 08-10-01, by the Task Force Leader on the incident.

Fire Line Concerns

(1) No thorough briefing was conducted prior to actually arriving on the Division.

(2) High Voltage Power Lines noted upon arrival. Informed by power official that lines were/are carrying one million volts at all times. Noted type 6 engines trying to suppress fire edge underneath power lines. Type 6 engines were directed to suppress any and all fire present under the power lines by prior overhead. Immediately with power official, I ceased suppression operations with water under power lines, as further actions would result in arcing of lines and serious injuries/death.

(3) Briefing of resources was not performed at the ICP of potential danger around power lines. This was done by myself at the designated contact point (140 and hummingbird rd.) prior to being sent onto the fire perimeter.

(4) A drop point was designated underneath the power lines. This was eventually moved to a different area which created confusion as the drop point designator number (DP50) remained the same. Both Drop Points were still being used for operations and had to be referred to as old DP50 and new DP50.

(5) All incoming personnel had to travel under the power lines to reach the Division, there was a possibility of arcing from the lines due to smoke and other suppression efforts.

(6) Noted retardant drops directly on the power lines. These drops did create arcing. This was witnessed by many individuals. power official informed me that once the arcing takes place it will travel to the nearest conductor, and if it was a person it would result in death.

Operations Concerns

(1) Upon my arrival I met with division supervisor and told him of my strategy to control fire by putting in dozer line outside of power lines and burning out of fuels. He informed me that operations would not allow any burn out operations to be initiated.

(2) By not allowing burnout operations to occur, we could not establish a good anchor point and good black to work off of.

(3) Improper equipment to conduct operations was noted. Hand crews were utilized to perform work that heavy equipment should have been used for (Crews told to tear apart large old wind rows by hand).

(4) No line safety personnel, no line EMTs or medical personnel were assigned to any divisions. It wasn't until my third shift (aug. 8th) that I saw a line safety officer.

(5) I noticed that personnel were being sent to the line without enough water and electrolytes. Temperatures were in the 90s and humidities were very low. After talking to some crews they said they were having trouble getting water. During the morning briefing on Aug. 7th, the IC told fire personnel that you guys have depleted us of all the bottled water, and we will not purchase any more. Any and all bottled water we have left will be placed in the trough and we will have a guard there to distribute one bottle per person. Water up through the bleached potable water source. I was informed by some crew bosses that some of their crew members react to bleached water, making them ill.

(6) On August 8th, at 1100, a major event occurred to line personnel that caused severe stomach illnesses and vomiting. Within two hours, half of one crew on my Task Force became ill by vomiting and stomach cramps. At 1300, other Division Supervisors started to have the same type of illnesses on their divisions. Line overhead requested that fire camp check into the causes of why so many are coming down with these illnesses. The team ordered a health inspector to come in and check the kitchen to see if it was a food preparation problem. The next morning, the team announced that it was not a food preparation problem but a dehydration problem. Soon after that, bottled water and electrolytes showed up at camp. Crews were not allowed to get a case at a time but rather had to get water and electrolytes from their strike team leaders and task force leaders.

(7) The contractors were being charged $7.00 per drinking water cubitainer (5 gallon), therefore they were not getting enough water to function safely.

(8) Planning meetings were very unprofessional. Division Supervisors were being asked what resources they had assigned to them even after six shifts on the incident.

(9) It was obvious that the team was overwhelmed with the incident and the numbers of resources assigned.

Logistical Concerns

(1) Kitchens and shower units were not capable of servicing all personnel on the fire. Long lines created such waiting time that many personnel didn't eat or get showers. Due to numbers of people being serviced, the kitchen was hurried in preparation of food and some of the dinners and breakfasts were undercooked.

(2) Due to the number of personnel assigned to the incident, the kitchen crews were being overworked. Lunches being prepared were not marked with preparation dates. One incident was noted involving a lunch sandwich that had a bite taken out of it prior to its distribution and placed back into the bag.

(3) Daytime sleeping areas for Night Shift personnel were not adequate for proper rest. On the average, crews were getting 3 hours of sleep a day. There were no tarps or shade available for most crews. Some slept in the gym of the school but boilers used to heat water for showers kept temperatures in the 90 degree range inside. This created uncomfortable sleeping as well as working conditions for the support personnel.

(4) There was no human resource specialist assigned with the team and when I tried to voice my concerns involving health and safety issues I had to go through several channels. Many of the issues were never resolved including the night shift sleeping area.

(5) Personnel had to stand up at tables to eat in the feeding areas where there was no shade.

(6) Hand washing facilities (plastic basins) were filthy and hadn't been cleaned. There was black rings around each basin and crews were concerned about bacteria left behind by previous users.

(7) There was a fuel tank within 20 and 40 feet of the eating area. Fumes from the fuel was drifting into the eating area. Several requests were made to move the fuel tank but it never was moved.

(8) Port-A-Potties were placed next to the eating area and cleaning and pumping occurred during the eating times.. There was a dumping station next to the eating area also and there was raw sewage being dumped at times that crews were eating.

(9) There was not enough port-a-potties to service the whole camp and the resources assigned.","See Narrative for situations that need to be looked at and could be changed.

The purpose of this report is to identify problems encountered by our crew on a Fire.

Overview

The incident of August 2001, was plagued by flaws in Logistics, Finance, and Operations that resulted in substandard firefighting conditions. Four primary factors contributed to this situation: (1) a poorly managed camp; (2) an unsatisfactory kitchen facility; (3) conflict with regards to timekeeping for regular federal employees; and (4) poorly planned operations. These problems indicated that the management team’s attempts to save money compromised firefighter welfare and safety.

Camp

Unsanitary wash stations, poor daytime sleeping conditions, cold showers for female crewmembers and difficulties in obtaining basic firefighting needs made the Fire Camp an unacceptable location for firefighter rest and recuperation. Poorly maintained wash stations constituted health hazards. Crews returning from the night shift received little rest because of inadequately cooled sleeping locations and a lack of sleeping pads for the gym floor. Female crewmembers never received warm showers during the incident. Firefighters could not obtain basic needs, such as lunches, cases of bottled water, and gloves without a crew boss’s signature, which caused great inconvenience. During one morning briefing the crews were chastised for consuming too much bottled water (despite hot arid conditions), when in actuality the bottled water was necessary for refilling canteens on the fireline. One team member stated something to the effect of 'We must be filling tenders with the stuff'.

Kitchen

Problems with inmate run kitchen unit included: (1) undercooked meat; (2) unsanitary eating stations; (3) no chairs or shade in the dining area; (4) lunches that were not dated and caused illness; and (5) an unreliable meal schedule. Starting time for dinner ranged from 16:30 to 17:15, which caused crews to wait in the sun for forty-five minutes before the night shift. Furthermore, few vegetarian lunches were available until several days into the incident.

Time

Team members confused the regulations governing contracted resources and federal employees creating a hassle over time posted on CTRs.

Operations

The Team failed to provide the necessary equipment and supplies to meet shift objectives. In one instance, 27 to 32 engines that were assigned to the highest risk for escape, area of the fire were not provided with sufficient tender support to sustain their efforts. The dry mop situation that resulted quickly made resources ineffective. Fireline overhead were made aware of a closer fill site that could have eased the situation, but failed to act. Instead, a three-hour turn around time for each tender was considered acceptable. Furthermore, hazards associated with high voltage power lines, while mentioned in camp briefings, were not covered in line briefings when crews arrived at their assigned work areas. A policy of remaining 500 feet away from high voltage lines was announced but was not practiced, and crews were assigned work areas well within the 500-foot buffer.

Conclusion

During the iincident the overall dollar amount of suppression efforts appeared to be placed above firefighter welfare and safety. The issues above could have been remedied had cost not been the dominant issue for the management team. It is the recommendation of this report that future incidents as complex as this fire should not be assigned to the same command team. Further, the extended attack procedures of this incident warrants a review.","see narrative  see last sentence of narrative","08/24/2001 00:00"

Subject:	Sleep Deprivation and Fire Safety

Recently we had over 130 lightning caused fires within the Burns Interagency Fire Zone. While zone personnel did an excellent job in fighting these fires, employees worked nearly continuously for 3+days; some for periods considerably beyond that. This included primary line people, overhead, support, and dispatch personnel.

Many people fighting fire would catch 3 hours sleep in the field, then get up and fight fire for another 18+ hours. This is not even close to adequate rest. After two days, extreme fatigue was very noticeable in most people. Thinking and communications was slower, less clear, and increased response times. People had much less resiliency. Tempers were shorter, some depression symptoms were noticed.

These observations are consistent with studies on sleep deprivation (see references attached). In these studies it was shown mental and physical impairments from sleep deprivation are similar to impairments from alcohol. People who drive or work after being awake for 17-19 hours perform worse than those with blood alcohol level of .05 (CNN report).

The current fire fighting policy regarding 1 days of rest for every 14 days of work assumes that people are working in shifts and getting regular rest. This usually is not the case in initial attack situations. In these situations, the 2/1 policy is more appropriate, with a limit placed on continuous duty prior to rest.

Fortunately, most of the recent fires had no wind and remained small. Had winds occurred and blow up situations resulted, fire fighter safety could have been compromised due in part to the fatigue level that most personnel were experiencing.

While it is common in initial attack to go periods without sleep, an extended initial attack of 3 + days without significant rest is pushing the risk factor up to what I would consider unacceptable levels.

With both fire and line being held accountable for fighting fire safely, it is appropriate and prudent to address this situation and work out some plan to get people rest so they are able to think and act clearly should an unexpected event happen.

So what might this mean:

1.	Planning for and requesting relief workers within the first 24-hour period of the initial attack when obvious that have numerous multiple incidents and/or extended IA potential.

2.	Prioritizing which fires will be attacked and in what order, so that if initial attack is delayed, fires with least potential for safety and resource damage are attacked last.

3.	Having a pre attack plan for a rotation schedule for IA employees to get adequate rest (7 hours minimum) and work no more that 24 hours non-stop.

4.	CDL drivers also need to adhere by driving rest policy and state law.

There may be resistance to doing this for the following reasons:

a.	Strong commitment to put out fires. Scheduling fire fighters during initial attack means that crews may be told to get rest while some fires have no received no initial attack. This may goes against fire fighter values and training.

b.	Fire fighter pride and can-do attitude and feeling of failure if additional resources requested for initial attack. At least one incident occurred in which an offer of help was rebuffed.

c.	Concern about additional acres being burned or resources being damaged while firefighters sleeping.

d.	Concern about loss/reduction in amount of money being earned fighting fire.

e.	Lack of relief resources available.

f.	Personnel did not have hard duty during their shifts. This has been expressed as justification to work employees beyond policies.

g.	Mind set that fires will be put out soon and no need to bring in relief workers.

h.	Getting caught in trap of responding to a chaotic situation with short-range tactical planning and action without considering longer-range strategic planning and action. The attached letter is being shared for information purposes only. The local Line Officers are addressing the fatigue/sleep deprivation concerns raised in this letter.

Similar issues regarding work/rest, fatigue, and effects of sleep deprivation on fire safety have likely been raised elsewhere in the system. This letter can be added to your record/data base of concerns on this fire safety topic.","Continue to reinforce, strengthen, and reissue policy letters concerning work/rest requirements, and need for adherence to the 14-day policy.","08/21/2001 00:00"

The BLM in Wyoming is in the process of converting their handheld radios from Bendix/King to Racal. I took the new Racal I was issued on the dispatch with me. The first day on the Lakeview Complex it was apparent that individuals on the incident were not hearing my communications. I tried multiple times calling people within line of sight with negative results. Later in the shift when I spoke to these people and I asked if I could be heard on the radio and the response was either no or very faintly. I checked my radio to insure that the correct frequencies were entered into the radio, the frequencies were correct. I also realized that the radio loves batteries, the radio generally would consume 2 sets of batteries per shift. Two days after the first incident I was reassigned to the Quartz Fire I continued to try the Racal radio on this incident with the same results. I placed the Racal in my tent and checked out a radio from communications. Since this occurence with my Racal I have spoke to other Racal radio users and heard the exact same thing. Nobody can hear you and it eats batteries. It is my opinion that the Racal radio is an unreliable communication tool for the fireline. Due to use of Racal radio was unable to effectively communicate with fireline personnel.","The agency should have performed longer field review or at least shared the field reviews with a wide group of fire management personnel.

Later this was cancelled and another BAER (2) team (not the local one) was put in charge at the request of the Forest Sup. Two of the four BAER (2) team members showed up without fire shelter training. They were given a 5 minute crash course on arrival and considered qualified. Several of us questioned this move since the rest of us were required to take the full 8 hour training earlier this year. Also the existing BAER (1) team was qualified to do the work and we appeared to be put in a secondary role so that others who were considered more qualified could take over, regardless of whether they met the mandatory safety training. The message I and others received from this is one of a 'dual standard' being applied to fires.

Later on in the incident, the BAER (2) folks denied some of us access to the fire area to do our BAER work because of the perceived threat of winds and a concern for blow down. However, other members were allowed out in these same conditions to do field work.

Radios and repeaters not working properly, resulted in a delayed response for a medivac mission on the Mad Creek fire. On Wed 7/25 around 0900, Craig Dispatch Center overheard a conversation on the radio between the Mad Creek IC and Hinman Helibase about a crew member with a knee injury. About 30 minutes later the IC was trying to call the helibase and the zone fmo on the Sand Mtn Repeater. He was unable to contact them, so he called CRC on Dunkley to request the helicopter for the medivac. For 20 minutes dispatchers tried contacting the helicopter, manager and chase via radios, cell phone and pager. Finally we were able to page the zone fmo. He was aware of the injury, but didn't know the IC was ready for the helicopter yet. The zone fmo was at the helibase and notified the helicopter of the mission. Once the helicopter was notified the medivac went smoothly. Luckily this was not a life threatening injury where 20 minutes would have made a difference. Resources on the fire are still having a hard time talking to each other through the repeater. They say it sounds like the repeater is hanging up or timing out.","The radio system on the Rout National Forest has been the subject of many SAFENETs and notifications to district and regional personnel. I am currently waiting a phone call from the radio person at the regional office. Last week I emailed interested parties about the Sand Mtn Repeater not working. Due to a limited number of radio techs on the forests, it is difficult for them to travel 3 hours each time the repeater is not working. Due to other repeaters and mountain tops (Mt Werner) not working on the forest, we were relying on the Sand Mtn Repeater to cover a huge portion of the forest. Human repeaters are set up with cell and satellite phones to establish communication with the fire and Craig Dispatch Center. In addition to the repeater not working, the forest uses the same frequencies for daily campground check-ins and fire traffic.  CRC will continue to document all incidents related to radios and elevate to the appropriate personnel. The radio system needs upgraded and additional frequencies have been requested.

Drivers on the fireline without fire shelters and proper PPE. July 24, myself and 2 others from our helicopter module flew up to Helispot 2 on the Green Knoll fire. This helispot was co-located with a road and Drop point. After we landed and improved the helispot, the crews started to arrive. All transportation was parked at the drop point, which was also co-located within 300 yards of the fire's edge. This edge consisted of a dozer line the crews were planning to burn out from. The drop point was located in a saddle on the southwest part of the fire.

After the crews hiked to the line, 2 bus drivers were left with the corresponding transportation. Both drivers were equipped with nomex and gloves, but one did not possess a hardhat. Neither of the drivers had a fire shelter in their possession. When asked by us, both drivers stated they had asked for shelters but none were available at the base camp. Both were trained in fire shelter use.

This concerned us due to the proximity of the fireline to the driver’s location. Also, the helispot was being used due to the egress (road) possibly being compromised by the day’s activities and active fire behavior. We were able to find extra fire shelters from line personnel (safety officer and field observer) to equip the drivers. No extra hardhat was found, so we encouraged the lady driver to check again at the base camp for one. She located one that evening.

I am writing this safenet as a reminder that drivers need the same PPE and equipment provided to all fireline personnel when they drive crews out to the line. This would include drivers of logistical items too. A road is not always an escape route, and a vehicle is NOT a safety zone.","I believe this same issue was addressed and mitigated at the Clear Creek fire of 2000 by requiring that drivers attend 'Standards for Survival' and fire shelter training.

The victim remained semi-conciencous but was incoherent.

The victim was evaluated by the paramedics, as was immediately transported to the Seward Hospital. After evaluation and observation at the hospital, the victim was released back to the Kenai Lake Incident but was under doctors orders to not be returned to work for 24 hrs. This is therefore a reportable lost time injury.

This safety health issue is simply this: These standard issue fly tents and adjustable support poles are widely used on fires and other incidents in Alaska and the Lower 48. Until the appropriate corrective action is taken to replace the inadequate aluminum pins at the top end of these poles, personnel working under or near the tent fly are being exposed to injury.","1. Inventory our stock of Pole, Upright, Adjustable (Item #0083) for poles with aluminum pins. All six poles in a box must be inspected since both the stock poles with aluminum pins and those that have been rehabilitated with metal bolt pins can be found in the same box.

2. Provide instruction to personnel using fly tents with adjustable poles on the proper method for erecting and securing the tent flys, including the proper placement and tying off of guy rope to the fly and pole to minimize the movement of the fly tent.

3. Safety officers and logistics personnel should be made aware of this problem and include the inspection of fly tents in their list of 'to do' items.  In Great Basin Cache, these poles with broken aluminum pins are rehabilitated with a metal pin (made with bolt stock or 'all thread' inserted into a nut welded to a large washer).

This rehabilitation appears to be very successul in mitigating this problem.

Contact Paul Naman, NIFC, BLM NFES Coordinator for retrofit they are implementing to correct the problem.

On the Kenai Lake incident, we have taken immediate action to notify all personnel of the problem are are correcting it as quickly as possible with available supplies. All fly tents are being inspected to insure that they are properly secured.

NIFC should take the lead in notifying all of the Cache's about this equipment defect, and provide instructions for the corrective retrofit that will make these units useable.

Photos of the defective aluminum pin poles along with a picture of the rehabilitated pole with metal pin are included with the incident investigation report in the Finance Section of the final fire package for the Kenai Lake Fire","06/30/2001 00:00"

The RTF radio system in Craig Dispatch Center is not working correctly. This is a recurring issue, as we never know if it will be working or not. As of this report we are still unable to transmit on Mt. Werner. Mt. Werner also has the flight following and air guard frequencies. We have been unable to test these frequencies from an aircraft to see if they are still working. The Mt Werner site is often down and unreliable. It has been necessary for resources on the RTF to use the BLM Lookout or Juniper repeaters during fire suppression activities. When using the BLM repeaters, communications are still scratchy and hard to copy due to the long distance to the repeater. On Wed 6/27 personnel/engine from South Dakota were doing a patrol on the forest. They tried contacting Craig Dispatch (CRC) with their locations. CRC was able to hear them, but apparently they were unable to copy us. We tried all of the forest frequencies and were unable to contact them. The same situation occurred on the next day. When personnel from the engine tried calling us on the radio we had to call them back on the cell phone and hope they were in cell coverage. Radio checks were done with the Steamboat Springs office and CRC, apparently this problem is between the Steamboat and Craig office. However, the Steamboat Office has been having some of their own radio problems.

The radio tech in Laramie was notified, along with the Zone FMO and District Ranger.","The problems with the RTF and CRD radio systems have been identified in numerous Safecoms, FAST Team Reports, and other documents. Not being a radio tech, I am not sure what exactly needs to be done, but corrective action needs to be taken immediately to ensure communications are in place and that firefighters safety is not jeopardized.  Currently the RTF is without a Radio Tech. So one person is responsible for the entire Med Bow -Routt National Forest and one person cannot keep up with the problems. The problems keep being identified, but until the forest sets priorities, the problems will continue to occur.

Topic: SAFENET Alert within most R5 Emergency Command Centers 		

Issue: The SAFENET alert is severe to high competition for frequency use between law enforcement and investigation (LEI), fire and aviation, recreation, timber, wildlife, and engineering personnel. Safety of all forest personnel is being compromised due to inadequate equipment, frequency, and personnel.

Background: The technology – radios, repeaters, phones, software, CAD - in the R5 Emergency Command Centers (ECC) has improved the dispatcher’s ability to track resources in the field; however, it has become increasingly difficult for dispatchers to prioritize frequency use, and the increased demand for dispatch services that is compounded by the limited number of frequencies in the ECCs. For the past 3 years, the R5 ECC Managers have written and briefed the R5 Fire and Aviation Management on a series of issues related to this SAFENET alert. The following key points are topics of previous briefing papers.

•	Priorities and Time: It is becoming increasingly difficult for dispatcher to prioritize frequency use, especially between LEI and fire, and it becomes problematic when an incident needs quickly changes. Or at times, a dispatcher maybe addressing a LEI request while performing aircraft flight following and/or working a medical call. These frequent conflicts should both have priority. On any given day, a dispatcher may have a customer pending for twenty minutes or more for their services.

•	Frequency Constraint: The system’s ability to handle high volumes of radio traffic exceeds the systems capability to support it; only so much information can fit through the frequency pipeline.

•	Module Configuration, Staffing and Schedules: The ECC standard module configuration is not designed for today’s workload, is inadequate to meet dispatch service demands, and has become a limiting standard. Consequently, ECC dispatchers are being constantly pressured to over extend their shifts from 8-10 hour days to 14 hours, and that leads to funding issues, increased stress and burnout in all of the ECCs..

•	Workload: LEI dispatching is very technical and specialized, and the demand for dispatch services has increased significantly across the Region primarily from the increased number of law enforcement and investigation (LEI) personnel hired in 2007 and 2008. LEI incident numbers in most ECCs have more than doubled . On a daily basis, non-fire emergency incidents, natural resource activities, recreation activities, and extended support for international, national, state, and local emergencies has out-numbered fire incidents approximately 10 to 1.

•	Equipment: ECCs have incurred costs to acquire furniture, radio consoles, repeaters support, dedicated computers and printers to perform requested dispatch services for LEI.

•	Dispatcher Position Descriptions: The primary purpose of the forestry technician dispatch position has changed from supporting fire suppression activities to supporting all-risk incidents, and LEI dispatching duties are not within the current position descriptions.

Recommendation: Equip each R5 ECC with adequate equipment, frequencies, and staffing to meet the ECC workload demands.

nothing was taken care of. Then in August an E-mail came thru about radio problems on fire incidents and we reported our problem. This prompted some action and by the end of September they were off our net. Now this year it is back and I have talked with Facilities on it but nothing has improved.

- Active Military exercise

- Razor wire The purpose of this SAFENET is to describe the events that took place on Fire B-081, located on Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. On May 16th, 2001 myself and another gentleman responded to a 1-acre fire located near the Manchu small arms range on Eilson Air Force Base. We were led into the ' Small ammunition dud area' to investigate the fire. Enroute I witnessed several small casings from used ammunitions; dud casings with shells attached, as well as spent live munition casings. On the fire, while cold trailing, I cut my finger on a section of razor wire. When I asked the Captain of the Bravo 1171 company what exercise they were performing he told me that they were doing ' live' exercises with ' real rounds'. When I voiced my concern with the safety of the area he assured me that the exercises were over until tomorrow at 1100 hours. That night the fire was rather uneventful, except for the sounds of several (40-50) rounds heard in the near distance (200 meter).

The following morning we returned to the fire to make sure it was out. We contacted the Captain of the Bravo 1171 company. Again, he assured us that no exercises would be conducted until we left the fire at approximately 1100 hours. We checked the larger 1-acre fire then proceeded to two smaller fires located near the ' Danger! Small ammunition' sign. While checking these fires at approximately 0930, a small group of 10-15 soldiers ran out from some trees (200 meters). They dropped to the ground, behind a log, and then pointed their guns in our direction. I shouted at them and did not receive an apparent response. A minute later they retreated back into the wood. Then a second group, or perhaps the same group repeated the same advance. In response, we vacated the area. When we got near the group which was performing these exercises they said the guns were not loaded.

This experience led me to ask the question, 'Should we have been there at all?' I think not. I felt that our safety was compromised and that our response to leave was correct.","-Cease all military exercises.

The concern was lack of communications and squad bosses ability to do the assigned task. There was very little direction given to crew on what the assignments and tasks were. Basically what happened was too much fire was put on the ground at one time, which resulted in extreme spotting with extreme wind conditions. Smoke played a very large role in this particular situation by making it very difficult to see or even breath. Many firefighters were taking in so much smoke that nausea, headache, and disorientation was apparent. The direction from the squad boss was not in any way in affect for crew direction. Extreme fire behavior made the situation hazardous for many people.","If more communication was made to make objectives and tasks more clear, some of these situations might not have occurred.  More personnel and radio contact. Make sure that firefighters are briefed on their assigned tasks, and crew expectations.

18 WATCHOUTS - No communication link with crewmembers and/or supervisors.

There is ONLY simplex frequency communications on the MS Sandhill Crane NWR - there are NO repeaters and/or repeater frequencies. Due to the flat terrain and dense fuel cover, radio transmissions on simplex frequencies are extremely limited and therefore hazardous to fireline personnel.

Given the above communications problems, coupled with the fact the IHC was from another geographic area, at least WATCHOUT #4 becomes an issue (Unfamiliar with weather and local factors influencing fire behavior). IHC assigned to incident; pursuant to written August 2000 National Fire Director Frequency Misuse letter, IHC Supt requested and was assigned a NWR simplex frequency.

IHC Supt. was informed that communications were limited due to no repeater frequency.

Concern for Firefighter Safety. During a controlled burn of an abandoned hunting cabin and outbuildings, firefighters were exposed to a situation where multiple explosions of ammunition occurred during the fire. Firefighters were in the general vicinity of the structure applying water to some surrounding trees in order to minimize fire damage, when explosions occurred. Firefighters had conducted a search of building prior to ignition to remove any hazardous materials. Some ammunition was found and removed. Firefighters were directed away from the area and took cover behind trees and engines until explosions ceased. Concern regarding flying projectiles were expressed by crew although none were observed.","Contact was made with the Maryland Fire Marshals Office and information was given by a Bomb Squad Technician, who advised the following information. 'Firearm Ammo when subjected to extreme heat and fire expands with a minor explosion which separates the bullet from the casing causing the bang or pop noise. Because this explosion occurs in an open environment where there is no compression and/or directed propellant, this is considered a low hazard situation. However, if the ammo is in a closed container where the force is contained or directed, portions of the shell, casing, container may be propelled short distances. Shotgun shells, which generally have a plastic case are most likely to melt prior to the explosion and the contained shot are generally released and the powder charge explosion is generally harmless.' The technician advised that 20-30 ft should be a safe distance.

Fire managers should be aware of this situation and brief crews when around these hunting or shooting areas during wildland fire actions. Firefighters when exposed to these situations, should take appropriate action of seeking cover if in the immediate vicinity until explosions cease. Now with the appropriate knowledge, firefighters will not be stationed in close proximity to any burning structure unless other safety issues dictate the necessity.  Hunting camps, blinds, shooting ranges, or vehicles which potentially contain abandoned ammunition should be inspected and hazard removed in a RX burn situation. During wildfire situations firefighters should be briefed on the possible hazard and directed to take appropriate action. Firefighters should not be stationed in close proximity to any potential sites which may contain ammunition unless necessary.

Firefighter safety is first concern and firefighters will not be stationed in close proximity to these potential threats.","04/13/2001 00:00"

The engine was facing downhill. We were directed to pretreat some small areas of reprod which were adjacent to a unit we were planning to burn that day. We used 2 loads of water and were preparing to start on a third. I parked the engine at the side of the road. Then moved the gearshift to neutral and set the emergency brake and got out of the cab. On my way back to get the wheel chock I stopped to extend a 50 ft. section of hose w/nozzle and told my crewperson to engage the PTO. Shortly after doing this the engine proceeded to roll forward. The truck went off the bank and landed on its side in a cluster of small trees.

Fortunately no one was injured. The engine was not totaled and is being repaired.

The important message here is that although the selector had been moved to neutral position THE VEHICLE WAS STILL IN 6TH GEAR! Engaging the PTO pump caused the vehicle to move under its own power. It is important that all of our operators of fire engines and crew buggies with the Allison 6 speed transmission hear about this accident. I would strongly urge them to make sure the vehicle is actually in neutral before leaving the driver’s seat, and by all means get a wheel chock under the tire before doing anything else. See above.","Some form of confirmation that the gear selected is the gear you are actually in! It has been suggested that a glow light of some kind be mounted in the drivers cab as well as the pump control panel confirming that you are in neutral.

1. The RACAL 25 Radio has the ability to erase all existing programming and radio configuration when programming from the keypad. This renders the radio useless until reprogrammed with a PC.

2. The radio will shut off without warning during use if battery becomes low during transmit leaving user without any communications.

3. User may not receive calls if scan delay features are enabled.

4. Some users have reported not being able to communicate with someone as close as 200 yards when using talk around or car to car. Radio programming can be deleted through keypad programming in the Global section. The Global section is where the Backlite setup resides. If the down arrow is pressed one time the menu item that appears on the screen is ERASED. If the ENTER key is pressed ALL programming is ERASED.

If the battery becomes low (somewhere around 80% of full charge according to the battery indicator) the radio will shut off without any warning thus leaving the user without any communications until the battery is replaced.

The factory default settings in Scan Timers - Scan Delay, Scan Reply, Monitor Timer, and Scan Rate - causes the radio to 'sit' on a channel for up to 30 seconds. During this time, it will prevent the user from receiving calls on a different channel. These features need to be set to zero.

We have no idea what is causing the problem with talk around. The dense surface brush is suspected to be the culprit.","Tne only items that can be 'fixed' by the field are the Scan Timer and Scan Rate features. The other items appear to be design problems.

During the initial attack and extended attack phases of the fire, prior to the Type 2 teams arrival, communications were non-existent between overhead and mutual aid resources in many locations.

SF Divide was upgraded in December.  Since the upgrade, radio communications has been poor and have continued to remain so especially these last couple of weeks.  Dispatch has had to work around the issue as best as possible through the use of other repeaters, but this work around is limited due to locations of resources in the field and radio coverage.

Night ignitions were necessary due to the dry fuel conditions, fuel load and the fact that we were burning an MSO PAC for research and needed to minimize the fire behavior as much as possible for the current conditions.  We had two burn groups working the north end of the proposed burn area; Firing group #1 on the East side and Firing Group #2 on the west side with the plan to bring fire from north to south within the containment lines and a series of drainages that separated the two burn groups.  The fire behavior was very active and we had to adjust burn patterns and techniques a few times in order to lesson the severity within the block.  We also had numerous spots across one of our holding features which slowed progress slightly.  As progress was made from north to south Firing group #1 held up their burn to let firing group #2 tie into their fire  before moving to another section of the burn area.  Additionally a fenceline slowed down some of the interior burners close to the tie in point. As the rest of the burners progressed a horseshoe occurred in the middle that cut off the interior burners separating the burn group into two groups with the horseshoe in between.  As progress was made toward Group #1 fire/tie in point 6 of the burners from Group#2 were cut off from their escape route and they were forced to walk through fire/heat to get out to the road and safety. Burners along the road had brought fire too close to the tie in point and before the burners could get to the road the lines of fire had grown together and created a barrier to the road. The time of this occurrence was around 0230 on the 26th.  At this point all of Firing Group #2 was absorbed into the holding group and Firing Group #1 continued with ignitions for another 2 hours or so.","I was informed of the event around 0430-0500 in the morning after ignitions were complete.  Not much specific information was giving at the time but I was made aware of the issue.  At the time sounded more like the gap was narrow- not a complete barrier.  I asked more specific questions to those involved at the briefing the next evening at 1800 and it became apparent to me that we needed to conduct an AAR.  Due to the timing of these events and the day/night shifts and time off needed the AAR was scheduled for Monday the 30th so that all parties involved would be able to attend (except for Prescott C-2).  A thorough AAR and discussion occurred on Monday the 30th with a lot of discussion and venting.  A few common themes/findings:<br/><br/>1.  Night time burn- things aren't always as they appear at night (i.e. distance, fuel load, etc.) and most of the burners had not walked the unit during daylight hours.  May have been a contributing factor.<br/><br/>2.  Dry fuels/ heavy fuel load was conducive for active fire spread.  Multiple comments were made about the gap left for burners to get out closed much faster that anticipated.<br/><br/>3.  Communication- a lot of individuals said they thought about saying something but didn't. Example- moving too fast, the stagger of burners was off, too many burners, etc.<br/><br/>4.  Condensed time frame due to ADEQ stating we would not have approval for the following night due to smoke in the Verde Valley from the day before- basically telling us to get it all done quickly.<br/><br/>5.  FIRB acting as a burner instead of performing FIRB functions only- could have used him as a scout ahead of the burners to let them know distance/time frame to tie burns in safely.<br/><br/>6.  Cumulative fatigue-  very long fire season straight into RX burning.<br/><br/>7.  Tunnel Vision/task focus- 'just wanted to tie in and move to the next task'","11/02/2017 16:09"

An engine was assigned to perform Structure Protection and as a result of parking the unit approximately 8-10 feet from a barn, the vehicle sustained moderate flame and heat impingement damage to the driver side of the vehicle. Damage includes cracked driver side windshield and gasket melted, driver side, side window cracked and gasket melted, paint bubbling, emergency lighting melted, marker lights melted, all pump panel gauges and controls melted and unreadable and 1.75' hose melted in the crosslay bed. Structure Protection of the barn appears to have been performed with a 0.75' hard booster line with no WUI Structure Protection lines deployed. It should be noted it does not appear the engine was backed in to perform structure protection which may have played a factor in deciding to leave the vehicle in place and not moving. This was compounded by the fact that many, if not all four (4) crew members do not have any NWCG and/or CICCS Wildland Firefighter Qualifications or Certifications for the positions they held on the Type I Engine for this assignment. It is unknown at this time if the vehicle was removed from the incident and/or if it has even been reported to the Atlas Peak Incident Commander or Safety Officer for the Division assigned. In addition to the lack of Qualifications and Certifications, it is believed this is a result of a lack of situational awareness in the WUI by utilizing a 0.75' booster line for the fire conditions presented.","It has been stressed on several occasions to management, the personnel within Northern California Fire Protection District are lacking the requisite training and qualifications for Wildland Firefighting, Strike Team and Task Force assignments for all levels (positions) on Type I, Type III, Type V and Water Tender assignments. The Northern California Fire Protection District is a Volunteer Fire District with two (2) full time suppression personnel. Training seems to be a low priority and is evidenced by the Volunteer Battalion Chief/Training Officer who is almost always absent from training, has geared a lot of training to web based and is lacking the qualifications/certifications himself for the position he is currently assigned. This was a 'fortunate' event in the sense nobody was seriously injured or killed and only vehicle damage was incurred.","12/19/2017 11:07"

Cody Dispatch has experienced multiple issues when transmitting on the Wind Rvier Agency repeaters. The majority of the time it takes dispatchers several times to key up the repeaters in order to transmit information. This delays relaying information and causes concern that if an emergency happened dispatch would not be able to provide immediate help. During the Solar Eclipse this was a major concern that the dispatch center had as communication was very unreliable. Many times dispatch could not contact fire resources on the radio and were not kept in the loop in order to relay information to the duty officer. Cody Dispatch opened a radio ticket on our system as we weren’t sure if it was on our end or not. The Forest Service Radio Technician went through the dispatch system and could not find any issues with our equipment. Cody Dispatch is not experiencing these issues with any of the other federal agencies that are dispatched out of Cody. The FS technician seemed to think that once the Solar Eclipse traffic had left the communications would get better. However that has not been the case. Currently Cody Dispatch cannot transmit on the Signal Hill repeater and the Boysen Peak/Black Mountain repeaters are very intermittent and unreliable. Cody Dispatch cannot maintain the expected level of service to those firefighters out in the field. <br/><br/>This is a major safety concern.  It has been extremely frustrating trying to establish and maintain radio communications with the St Lawrence fire.  This weekend the dispatcher would call Ft. Washakie to get a hold of the fire.  The dispatcher here could hear them try on Black Mtn repeater as well with no luck.  Ft. Washakie would call back with the requested info.  When Ft. Washakie was asked how they were getting a hold of the fire they said they were calling them on tac. This is not a good way to conduct business and the concern is if there were a medical situation or an emerging weather update where time is is of the essence dispatch would need direct contact with the incident.<br/><br/>In discussions with field going personnel they have indicated that they have had a visual of the Boysen and Black Mtn repeater and still could not key it up.","Tickets have been submitted.  In discussions with the local fire management they will be ordering a portable repeater to establish communications with the field until the repeaters get fixed.<br/><br/>Relaying through Ft.

Serving as members of a single resource, Type 3 U.S. Forest Service engine, we had been ordered up from our home unit, the Descanso Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest for the incident on August 30th. We began our first operational shift on August 31st and the events occurred on Sunday, September 3rd, our fourth operational period on this incident. The numerous safety issues we present now in this SAFEnet were addressed on this day with our supervisor/module leader, and in the subsequent days that followed we debriefed as a crew the events that happened.<br/><br/>The primary focus for the first three shifts on Division Whiskey were structure protection and preparation in the Sugar Pine community of residential houses, prepping roads, and some hose lays along dozer and hand lines in support of burning operations. <br/><br/>On the afternoon of the 3rd, we had been prepping some structures along Poplar and Locust roads, when predicted thunderstorms developed over the fire area, and an Incident Meteorological announcement came out over the command channel alerting all resources of the possibility of lightning strikes, erratic and strong downdraft winds, as well as an overall possible wind shift from prevailing Western and Southerly winds to winds being out of the Northeast with gusts up to 40 m.p.h. The weather update was acknowledged was known to all members of our module, and our module leader who was with us, copied the weather update when asked by our Division Supervisor. Our immediate concern for the approaching weather system was the strong winds mixed with the large stands of beetle killed pines in the community, but additionally that the community of Sugar Pine laid in a valley with a Northeast to Southwest alignment, similar to the alignment of the predicted wind shifts. <br/><br/>Having completed our assignment of prepping structures and upon hearing the weather update, we proceeded to walk back to our engine parked nearby at the community center. Our module leader consulted with other module leaders in the area, face to face, including a hotshot superintendent. Our module leader told us at this time they believed the fire had changed directions, was heading towards us, and there were reports of 100 ft flame lengths. At this time, the Division Supervisor ordered all resources, except for our engine and two other U.S.F.S. engines, out of the Sugar Pines community and back to the 41 road. The Division reported over the radio that they wanted to keep the three U.S.F.S. engines in Sugar Pine in case an emergency burn operation was put into action. At this time, our engine crew began to discuss a number of safety concerns with this plan. Elements of L.C.E.S. were scrutinized by the crew; communications in the valley had been spotty, Lookout was unknown by our module leader, the proposed escape route to the safety zone was in alignment with the winds and topography with a possibility of being cut off in the event of the possible emergency burning operation, no alternative escape routes were identified and there was no adequate safety zone in the immediate area. Additionally, we were not in direct contact with anyone that had eyes on the fire and no trigger points for evacuating had been identified. We, as a crew, advised our module leader/supervisor of these serious concerns, and that we felt it best to disengage and return to the 41 road until a solid plan, with good intel, was in place and these L.C.E.S. concerns were mitigated. We were met with hesitation and our concerns at this time were dismissed by our module leader with a “It’ll be fine”. We continued to press the issue of L.C.E.S., lack of clearly identified trigger points (there were none), knowledge of current fire behavior (or lack thereof), and we were unsure of what the fire was doing, and our module leader was unable to definitively answer these questions. Our module leader continued to use words like: Probably, Maybe, and Should. We were then told that our “job is dangerous”. We assessed as a crew that it was at least 12 minutes drive from our current location, back to the 41 road, and then another 10 minutes to Oakhurst, our reported safety zone, which possibly lay in the path of the main fire.","The corrective actions we took as a crew were convincing our module leader to allow us to disengage and postpone the plan. We waited out on the 41 road, becoming more familiar with the current fire behavior and situation. Around 18:00, the weather and fire behavior had calmed down, and our module leader agreed to scout the proposed hose lay from earlier. We as a crew waited while he and two CalFire captains scouted in the fading light of day. Our module leader had promised us he would return with info before committing us, however announced on the radio to a hotshot superintendent that the plan looked good, prior to returning. When our module leader returned, we discussed our concerns at this time: lack of a good safety zone, one escape route, poor communication/radio performance in the valley, the lack of daylight at this time and the fact that this hose lay was in heavy dead timber that had not been snagged by fallers, or even prepped by the hotshots. <br/><br/>Despite our concerns, we felt comfortable with the fire behavior, weather, though not the snags and the dark; and we relented to do the hose lay. All ended well, we completed the hose lay with the help of two CalFire engines quickly in the dark. After completing the hose lay, we were left waiting in the dark in snag country without our module leader sending us back to safety of the truck. <br/><br/>We discussed all the events several times as a crew with our module leader, each time met with resistance and excuses that were not valid in our mind. If we are to adjust our culture to make “Life First”, we should not have been out on the line at that time, it was no longer tactically necessary, or even feasible as it had not been prepped and need to be, and we should have waited til fallers came through and snagged it in daylight. <br/><br/>If we are as a profession to make changes and truly put the concept of “Life First”, changes must be made from the top down as well as from the bottom up. Line officers must begin to question the necessity of assignments and the timing of when they are to be best done, with safety at the forefront. Subordinates should feel empowered to speak up, not dismissed as being bothersome, disrespectful, or afraid and unwilling to work. Ego is a big part of this job, not enough and one will never succeed; too much and we risk putting ourselves in perilously unnecessary situations all because we are taking “slides” from the past and trying to make them fit the present. We must ultimately, practice what we preach. We must change. <br/><br/>We have hesitated as a crew to come forward with this SAFEnet, because of our concern over the fact that our supervisor is our module leader, and we need a good reference and to be able to work with him. But the weight of our individual career goals cannot be outweighed by our consciences and we feel that this must be shared. We began working on this shortly after our return while it was fresh in our minds.","11/13/2017 08:27"

When he contacted me about the incident, I suggested going to Ground Support and trading this vehicle for another one. I am transcribing the incident as written in his typed statement and it is attached below.<br/><br/>'On August 29, my Dodge Ram 1500 was parked and had been idling for about 10 minutes. I was standing a few feet away when it shifted, without input, from park into drive and began traveling on a path to collide with another parked vehicle. I rn towards the Dodge, opened the driver's side door, and kicked the brake causing it to skid to a stop. The distance between the two vehicles at the time was less than 5 inches. Upon further research, we established that my make and model RAM was indeed plagued with faulty circuitry in the dash mounted shifter knob. It appears this very same condition is reported to have already cause at least one death, and dozens of injuries.'<br/><br/>'On August 30, I brought my vehicle to ground support, relayed my experience and requested a different truck. While others at ground support were helpful and attentive to my request, one particular GSUL met me with obstinance and disrespect. He told me that without a computer readout from the truck, there was no way to tell if the story I relayed ever happened at all. I found this odd as the #1 incident objective is firefighter safety. Had I not been able to stop the vehicle, it would have collided with the other vehicle and both would have been badly damaged. Even worse, had my coworker been standing 15 feet to the left, he would have been pinned between the trucks causing severe injury or death.'<br/><br/>'When I informed this GSUL of the findings of my research, he responded, 'Do you know how many recalls are out there? What do you want me to do?' I told him it should be documented and my truck replaced. To this he replied. 'It wouldn't have happened if you had used the parking brake.''<br/><br/>'The disrespectful tone, and the utter disregard for our primary incident objective left me speechless. I was begrudgingly given the Chevrolet truck I requested and hurried to catch up with my crew.'<br/><br/>'As the job title implies, 'Ground Support' works to ensure personnel get the support they need to safely travel to and from the fireline. I felt I was given very little support in this matter and feel that this too should be documented. As a Alaskan firefighter, I would be remiss in not reporting any resource demonstrating such negligent, unprofessional, and deficient tendencies representing  my state or organization. Thank you for your attention to this matter.'<br/><br/>As reported by a Task Force Leader, this similar Dodge Ram incident also on the Liberty Fire in Montana the first week of  September on a Dodge Ram 3500? series truck with a column shifter arm. He said his truck was idling, in park without the parking brake engaged, and it shifted into reverse (without the shifter arm moving) and began to travel downhill. He also had to hurriedly open the driver's side door and stop the vehicle.","From the fireline, reported to IMT Safety Officers via text message that the incident had occurred and the recall link.<br/><br/>Had CREP write a statement of the incident ensuring anonymity.<br/><br/>Talked with Safety Officers and Deputy IC about the alleged unprofessional GSUL experience and the apparent conflicting safety values.<br/><br/>Passed on to other Safety Officers and WFF that this was occurring.","09/18/2017 14:21"

There were four Crews total with an Interagency Resource Representative (IARR).  The first day was orientation and setting up tents, etc. and then brushing a road for a firing operation. August 26 About 1100, the Line EMT advised me about an ill Crewmember (CM). His fellow CM’s had advised the Line EMT (“on the down low”) - “you may want to consider alcohol or drug withdrawals.” The Line EMT told me that “this has the possibility for serious medical complications.” Several fellow CM’s also shared this same guidance with the Task Force Leader (TFLD), “on the down low.” I advised our Division Supervisor (DIVS) of this CM safety issue, and then shared it with IMT Safety.  IMT Safety, aware of the issue, agreed: “this has been a common problem.” <br/>Our Complex experienced continual daily moderate to heavy inversions resulting in dulled senses and foggy thinking due to the unrelenting carbon monoxide exposure on the firelines and in some of the Spike Camps.<br/>August 27-28 – The CM was still incoherent. CREP advised me that the CM was not a workable member of the Crew and gives him a 1400 Trigger Point to improve. After no CM improvement, they demob the ill CM based on Line EMT and CREP recommendations. I advised DIVS R and IMT Safety of the demob. I engage in daily interactions with IMT Operations overhead (various OPS, Branch Directors, some DIVS) regarding leadership and PPE, discussions, reminders, reasons why, Red Book, etc. In addition, double standards were noted regarding adjoining forces when Safety Officers on other Divisions were failing to set a good example by not complying with basic safety rules, e.g. sleeves rolled up, no hardhats, not correcting and/or discussing safety issues with WF on the Divisions they are responsible for. While IMT Safety  was on a day off,  IMT Alternate Safety Officer filled in. A post-shift meeting with IMT Safety and Deputy IC brought up “issues” with the Crew.  <br/>August 30 (about 1300) Firing operations were likely to take place in Divisions S, R, and P proceeding from the top DIV S), through DIV R, and then down (DIV P). I proceeded to a Drop Point at the DIV S / R border to discuss our ‘Into Thin Air’ choke point issues with common Escape Routes, etc. DIVS  was busy multitasking, talking to a TFLD, talking on her cell phone, and dealing with a contact lens that fell out, in and out of her truck without her hardhat. I walked up to her sitting on the driver’s side and introduce myself as DIV R Safety Officer, exchange names, and shook her hand while doing so. I reminded her about wearing her hardhat when out of her vehicle due to hazard trees and setting the example as overhead per The Red Book.  <br/><br/>My goal as a SOF2 with a strong operational background, has always been to be proactive and recognize patterns, mishaps, and the like to prevent serious accidents, serious injuries, and fatalities rather than to be reactive, and deal with incidents after-the-fact. I will reference established research on Human Error, Safety, accident avoidance, conclusions and findings next and how it relates to this Incident.<br/><br/>There were similar experiences on two other fires this year.  A Type 1 IMT Safety Officer told me that he wanted me as the SOF2 to “play nice” and after my clarification question on that statement, he requested that I was “not to write any tickets,” i.e. not to be the ‘sleeve police.’ On the Fire, the incoming Type 2 IMT Safety Officers on Transition Day, arrived on the fireline at our Drop-Point in their truck without wearing fire shirts. I informed them that on our Division we wear fire shirts on the fireline and asked them why they were not wearing fire shirts. The Trainee explained that his was ‘Dragon’s Fur’ and was Nomex. I asked the IMT Safety, where his fire shirt was and he looked at me like ‘who the **** do you think you are?’ I asked him again and he looked at me the same way. I explained to them that this Double Standard on PPE made it very difficult to get WF to comply with basic safety rules when the IMT overhead have a different standard.","Continued to perform my Safety Officer responsibilities to the best of my abilities<br/><br/>Refused to lower my standards and adopt the IMT Double Standard regarding Leadership and PPE<br/><br/>Continued discussions with my supervisor(s) regarding the issues encountered<br/><br/>Filed a SAFENET on the Dodge Ram dash-mounted shifter knob recall and near-miss<br/><br/>Filed a SAFENET on the issues encountered on this Incident","10/16/2017 15:43"

Saw operations began at approx 1100 on an exposed ridge at 6600' elevation. After running the first tank without incident, the tank was refueled and the saw team sat down for lunch at approx. 1200.  The lunchspot was fully exposed to the sun and the temperature was 78-80 degrees F.  Saw fuel was being stored in MSR cig bottles, within a blue carry bag.  After a 30 minute lunch break, and upon re-start to begin the second tank, the saw would rev high, then bog down when the throttle was applied.  If the throttle was continually applied, the saw would die completely.  If the throttle was released and feathered, the saw would rev high again.  After going through this cycle for 2-3 mins, boiling gas was suspected.  The saw team let the saw sit for a minute or two.  The saw operator placed the saw on the ground, turned the fuel tank away from their body and vented the cap.  The cap was turned about 1/8 of a turn and fuel geysered from the partially open cap (away from any persons and into the ground).  After geyser incident, remaining fuel continued to boil inside the tank.  The saw team let the saw sit for another 2-3 minutes with the gas cap off.  The saw and operators were still fully exposed to the sun.  After the boil diminished, the fuel cap was closed and the saw was restarted.  The saw revved, bogged a few times and sounded lean.  Upon applying full throttle, the saw team cut into a log and heard the saw richen up and normalize.  After that, saw operations continued as normal.  Additional fuel was placed in the shade.  When the saw was refueled, the saw team kept the fuel level at 1/2 to 3/4 of a full tank, with no issues.  At 1600, the saw team dropped a few hundred feet during a 10 minute down hike.  After an additional 10 minute break, the saw was turned away from all persons, and the fuel cap was vented again.  Another geyser occurred.  Cooling process was repeated and saw operation continued as normal.  Fuel tank was 3/4 full, and the temp had increased to 86-88 degrees F.","Safe fuel cap venting protocol was followed.

The Burdette Fire is an isolated fire with limited access, burning on steep slopes with poor egress. The Sunrise Fire is directly adjacent to the I-90 corridor with road access but with drive times in excess of forty minutes to distant divisions. Neither one of these fires were staffed with paramedic qualified EMS support personnel. No ambulance was assigned to the fire in any location. Alaskan advanced EMTs were ordered for the fire but due to lack of medical reciprocity across state lines are unable to preform up to their full potential. This creates additional liability issues, as the Alaskan providers are placed in precarious situation of having to choose between utilizing their full skill set to potentially render the highest medical care possible or meeting the letter of the law and having a poor patient outcome.<br/>	The medical unit leader was approached and reported that there were no paramedics available in the state of Montana and that the Incident Medical Specialist had been trying to fill orders. This directly contradicts information received from the Montana State EMS office which reported that there paramedics available for assignment. There seems to be a break down in communication between the IMS program and the State of Montana EMS Division.<br/>	An out of region Division was assigned on July, 25th to the Burdette Fire but reported his unwillingness to commit resources to the fire until some form of medical support was established. He was subsequently removed from the incident and another division was assigned. Two days later a medical incident within an incident was declared and a patient was flown from the fire. No medical provider was assigned to the fire and crew resources were utilized to care for the individual. Patient outcome is unknown at this time. <br/>Firefighter safety was identified in the IAP as the number one priority and addressed in every morning briefing, but this glaring lack of medical support directly contradicts this priority.

In turn, the forest dispatch is having difficulties with communication to the remaining units on the forest. In an attempt to mitigate the issue, dispatch has had all traffic go through administrative net, including, occurring new incidents. <br/> Now, the forest dispatch is operating on a backup system and being on a backup system, communications with dispatch has been a nightmare. Resources are unable to hear their unit being dispatched to incidents and once on an incident the Incident Commander is having trouble relaying important information to dispatch.  Repeaters were staying open for 5 to 10 seconds after releasing the mic button and were not transmitting important radio traffic. Plus, dispatch having to dispatch resources on multiple tones.<br/> On July 18th, 2017, my engine was dispatched to the Hudson fire. We were informed incidents would be relayed through our Admin Net, however, the tone out for the fire came over Forest Net. The tone out was broken, scratchy, and difficult to comprehend the information being transmitted about the fire. The dispatch was trying to do check backs on multiple repeaters, which took a while for all resources dispatched to confirm response. The Initial size up was scratchy and hard to hear on the forest net repeat channel. When my engine got on scene we were unaware of the command and tactical channel change and thought that the command channel was still on forest net. Only after we spoke face to face to the new incident commander did we learn about the channel change.<br/>The simulcast is a problem, in all, we are seeking a solution that will mitigate communication problems with dispatch and other units on the forest. <br/>In closing 1- the biggest issue is the simulcast system. Every morning we hear the weather and daily fire staffing information multiple times because dispatch has to broadcast this info on multiple repeaters. This is not a big deal but when we have an incident the first on engine is trying to give a size up, updated fire conditions, and ordering more resources. The radio is open but undenounced to the IC dispatch is on other repeaters still dispatching resources and also has to get check backs from those resources<br/>In closing 2- the Whitter fire was using our forest net for over a week after the type 1 team took over the incident.

We assigned to patrol the White Rock Subdivision and perform point protection as needed when/if structures were threatened with any fire creeping around in yards or ditches. The main fire had already passed through the neighborhood and the fire activity around the neighborhood was minimal.<br/>  Our engine found a specific structure to protect with fire creeping in the properties front ditch, I instructed the engine operator to have the engine staged at the edge of the driveway on the road we drove in on which would allow us to pull hardline as needed to protect the structure which was about 50-75 feet away from the engine. After sizing up the main structure (single wide trailer style home), one large structure/shed farthest to the East, then several smaller shed structures, several vehicles, and also a 5th wheel style RV behind two of the sheds. The structures started to the East side of the property proceeding to the West on the Northern edge of the property line.<br/>  I determined that it was safe to engage in point protection. On the East side of the property there was a pile of tires (8-15) that were fully engulfed along with a creosote type frame. It was 50-75' from the main structure and had potential to compromise the home. Another hazard was a 500 gallon propane tank 10' from the home which posed a threat to the home but also our engine crew for engaging with structure protection. We were downwind from the tires and creosote frame that was burning but the smoke was 100' from the engine<br/>   An Nevada Division of Forestry type 4 wildland engine (NDF) arrived on scene and approached the property we had been at from another property from the North and began to engage with the pile of tires and creosote frame. The Structure Group Division arrived on scene and redirected the engine to another assignment.<br/>  After about an hour to hour and a half of being on scene, the fire from the tires and creosote had caused the farthest East structure to become compromised with fire and was engulfed shortly after. The fire then creeped into the next structure to the West and that structure was soon too compromised with fire. I radioed the Structure Group Division Supervisor of the events occurring and requested additional support. The NDF type 4 wildland engine that was on scene prior had returned per my request to Structure Group Division Supervisor. I asked the engine boss to pull an additional hardline to help support our operation and begin to spray down the home to prevent any embers from catching on the house. Shortly after they began to spray down the roof of the home, a small explosion occurred in the structure/shed directly across from the home. I was attempting to keep the vehicle next to the structure that had become involved cool enough where the tires would not become involved and the vehicle as well.<br/>  Immediately following the moderate explosion in the structure/shed I verbally announced to the NDF type 4 wildland engine that my crew was disengaging from the compromised structure/shed. The NDF type 4 wildland engine continued to engage in the structure by spraying water onto structure and the Structure Group Division Supervisor arrived on scene within minutes of the small explosion and my engine's disengagement. I informed the Structure Group Division Supervisor that my engine would not engage with the compromised structure but would be willing to defend the home from any fire that occurred in the surrounding yard. He requested we support the NDF engine by direct filling their tank which I agreed to and did. The Structure Group Division Supervisor requested additional support which did not arrive for 10-20 minutes. The NDF type 4 wildland engine still continued to engage with the compromised structure. None of the NDF type 4 wildland engine had structure PPE nor SCBA PPE as well. Multiple smaller explosions occurred while our engine filled the NDF engine.<br/>  Our engine then left scene to go fill off a tender that was staged a few blocks away near the I80 underpass headed to Oscino, NV. The requested structure engine and tactical tender arrived on scene as we were filling our engine and we returned to the scene. The Structure Group Division Supervisor left the scene and we began to patrol the neighborhood for several hours. The Structure Group Division Supervisor drove up in his command truck and then requested we put out several piles of debris. I asked directions into the yard and the only entrance to the yard would be downwind and also would have to engage downwind as well. We were able to approach the pile of unknown debris (appeared to be mostly wood) and was able to spray from 25-30' away from the pile without being affected by smoke. We did not touch the pile and used foam as well. Prior to engaging in those piles Division Zulu drove past and informed me of briefing time at 0600 at the Oscino exit gravel pit and then departed.<br/>  After 30 min of spraying down the pile, we began to patrol again and patrolled for another 1-1.5 hours. I noticed that there were no engines besides a Elko Country type 4 wildland engine and Elko Country structure engine was there besides our own. I then decided to have our engine go to where the tenders were staged to top off and attempt to contact Structure Group Division Supervisor for information about end of shift and if any other tasks/objectives were established. When our engine arrived at the tender staging area, the Elko Country structure engine was there and I tied in with the Captain to see if he knew any information regarding the end of shift.

This included checking tire pressure and checking the wheels for rust, discoloration, cracks, dents, abrasions, cuts, bulging, and lug tension via hand.  Throughout the entire incident we had been driving on highways, bumpy dirt roads, sandy areas, and dozer lines.  At roughly 1800, we were driving down Homestead Rd., Doyle, CA, which was a smoother dirt road, doing about 15-20 MPH, when I noticed a sound that mimicked that of a rock in the duel or a flat tire.  I had my Operator stop so that we could check to see what the issue was.  After inspecting the rear duels, we didn’t find anything to be an issue.  We got back in the vehicle and started driving again.  Once again I could hear a noise and now feel some sort of vibration.  Once again we stopped immediately.  This time I had my Operator drive forward while I watched the rear duels rotate from behind the vehicle.  They had normal rotation and nothing stuck in-between them.  I then went out in front of the truck and had him drive slowly at me while I watched.  At that point the right front steer tire was noticeably wobbling side-to-side.  I quickly had him stop the truck.  As I inspected the wheel I noticed that there were two lug nuts missing next to each other and the four of the remaining six were half way loosened on the studs. On closer inspection, I also noticed that where the lug nuts were missing, there was a paint color different than the rest of the wheel.  I ran my finger over the two different color paints and could feel a slight depth difference between the two leading me to believe that the original wheel color had been painted over.  Our Division arrived and inspected it as well.  He stated that he had heard of another report of a wheel coming off due to the wheel being repainted.  He said the report concluded that after repainting a wheel, over time it chips or rusts away, leaving a slight gap.  This could have been the root cause of the lug nuts backing off the studs.<br/>	Once we inspected the wheel, tire, and studs for any damage, we lifted the truck up via a jack, remounted the tire, and secured the remaining lug nuts.  It was at this point that I went around to the lug nuts on every tire to check to see if they were loose as well.  I discovered that every lug nut on the truck was a quarter to a half turn loose.  I tightened them all down using the lug wrench, and we made our way back to the ICP at a slow pace.<br/>	After arriving at the Incident Command Post, I notified our home units’ duty officer and our mechanic of the issue that had occurred.  We made arrangements for our on call mechanic to bring out spare lug nuts to replace the ones that were missing and to inspect the wheel and studs for possible damage the following morning.  The next day he arrived, inspected the wheel and studs finding no damage, and replaced the missing lug nuts.  We then returned to our Division without any issues for the remainder of the Incident.<br/>	The situation that occurred to us was brought up to not only the Safety Officer on our Division, but also the Type II Teams (So. CAL Team #2) Safety Officer in which he used as part of one of his briefings.","*Tires, wheels, lug nuts, and tire studs were inspected for any damage.<br/>*Tire was remounted and lug nuts were put back on and torqued down to OEM specifications.  <br/>*Vehicle was re-inspected by certified mechanic for clearance to return back to the fire line.","08/08/2017 12:29"

Engine B ENGB took IC of the fire and Engine A started working on a hose lay with crew members from Engine B.  After the hose lay was completed a sawyer from Engine A started cutting fire line around the fire. <br/><br/>At 1630 the saw that the sawyer from Engine A was using sputtered and died. Thinking the saw was empty the sawyer checked the fuel level through the tank. The saws tank appeared to be empty so the sawyer slowly opened the quarter turn style fuel cap to refuel. The saw gas inside the tank immediately began to 'geyser' and spray out. The sawyer blocked the majority of the fuel with a gloved hand but the sawyers chaps and pants still became saturated with fuel.<br/><br/>Immediately the sawyer called a crew member from Engine A over to spray his pants, boots, gloves, yellow shirt and saw chaps with water on high pressure from the hose lay. The sawyer also rinsed his hands and face with water trying to remove as fuel as possible. The sawyer then picked up his equipment and made his way off the fire line back to where Engine A and Water Tender C where parked. While hiking back, the sawyer made contact with the IC to inform him of the incident. <br/><br/>At 1645 The sawyer off Engine A removed fuel saturated clothing and hung them on a nearby tree.

Our task force was assembled from a different fire that we just initially attacked and were told that we were needed for structure protection for a community that was being impacted by the Long Valley Fire.  As far as I can tell, the IMT managing the Long Valley Fire did not know we were even there.  Our task force arrived to triage the neighborhood close to 11 o'clock in the evening.  While we were getting our briefing, a USFS engine that was assigned to the fire stopped by and managed to clone a few of our radios to the frequencies he was given from the team. We did not have an IAP and therefore had no com plan or weather information. We did not see any fire as the fire was still a few ridges away until the following day.  At around 7:30 the following morning we were told that our potential relief was not coming and that we should reassess the community during the day to become more familiar with the area.  The day carried on and around 2:30 in the afternoon we were told we were needed at the other end of the fire to protect more structures.  The entire task force caravanned over to what appeared to be the head of one of the more active flanks of the fire.  We were assigned to drive up the road and help protect a ranch threatened by the active flame front.  Our driving directions weren't very clear and we, the task force, ended up taking a junction in the road heading in the wrong direction which led us driving on a narrow one way road in the direction of the fire burning towards us.  We later found out that this fire was actually a burn operation from another task force we were supposed to be supporting.   At this point we realized we took the wrong turn at the junction and had to make a multipoint back up turn around to head back downhill.  As we were turning around we heard the instructions to switch frequencies because we were going to help burn around a ranch.  Up to that point we were working on VHF radios using a local tactical channel. The instructions to switch not only changed frequencies but a switch to 800mhz radios we also carry.  One of the rigs in our task force didn't even carry this radio type and was left without communication for a 10-15 minute span.  The one engine that did not have the new radios was given to handheld radios for this operation, once this operation was complete we returned to VHF but once again changed our tactical frequencies.  We ended up spending nearly 36 hours on the Long Valley fire but never checked in with the team.  Which also meant we never had an IAP for the incident.  There were no injuries or accidents, but the whole operation felt like we were just free lancing on a large fire that was being managed without us in their game plan.","We did not really understand if we were attached to the fire officially so we just kept calm and made sure we were all in a safe place.  As far as the communication issue, we made sure that the one crew that did not have 800mhz radios was given a few in a timely manner.  We voiced our concerns about the communication change and once it was noted we switched back to VHF and did not change frequencies.  Our task force worked well together and made sure we were always close and that communications did not become an issue within our group.","07/27/2017 11:51"

It was not until the Coronado National Forest Fire Leadership and the District Ranger agreed to have a cost-share agreement that the state actually started filling the orders for aircraft and type 1 crews.

However, at this point the fire was established because the orders that were placed were not being filled. This has been a trend for the Southeast Arizona fire season on State Jurisdiction fires.  It is my concern that the AZ State Forestry department is transferring risk to other firefighters and aircraft by not engaging fires with an appropriate response that is determined by the Incident Commander who is actually on scene.<br/><br/>The hand programming of radios on the scene could easily have been avoided with pre-season coordination between the agencies involved to set up an initial attack group that all of the resources could have pre-programmed in to their radios.","12/19/2018 16:29"

Elko County Fire Protection District responded to a fire at MM 327 on I-80 and was later called River Ranch Fire.  Elko County responded with E1 and E2 along with federal resources.  The federal resources that were on the incident including the IC was from off district and was unfamiliar with local resources and the truck identifying system the county uses, and that it does not follow any common ICS based typing.  While units were in mobile attack Division Alpha requested assistance from a Type 3 engine, he was advised that E1 and E2 was working up his division and that one was a type 6 and one was a type 3.  Since the County identifiers for trucks don't follow standard ICS typing the division requested E1 believing it was a type 3, but E1 was a type 6 and E2 was a type 3.  This resulted in county units being sent to wrong locations and units engaged in mobile attack was anticipating support from a type 3 and did not receive that.  This same problem occurred several times through out the incident and led to continued confusion with units on the fire on where certain trucks were located.  This type of confusion can result in a lack of accountability and can put firefighters at risk.","As the fire progressed and the out of district resources continued to get confused on what County truck was what, we met face to face with the Division and IC and told them we will rename the trucks for the fire.

J) on the Brian Head Fire there was mention of a PSD operation that was going to take place. This was going to happen on an adjoining division(Div. I) where they were going to clean up some unburned islands in the burn area. This conversation was held on the (Div .I) Tac channel, which let all the resources operating on that channel know what operations were going on. During this time, I did not witness any burning on (Div. I) but did notice some new smoke on (Div.J). I decided to send two hotshot crewmembers on a UTV to get a closer look at what was going on. Once they arrived they heard the (Div.J) TFLD talking to the helicopter and telling them to not drop any closer to the dozer resources working the indirect line. The PSD helicopter responded that everything was ok and things were doing good. At the time of the PSD operations on (Div J) the control line was still being built by two dozers working uphill and to the south of the PSD operation. The PSD helicopter did another strip just interior of the first strip and then one in the middle of a green pocket in the center of (Div. J) before flying away.  Shortly after the PSD ship had left the TFLD made contact with the dozer group and had them start tracking north to a constructed safety zone. As the dozers tracked out they were met by two TFLD's, two safety officers, and two IHC crewmembers. Each group had a UTV making it a total of 3 machines. Around the time they all tied in with each other, the initial wave of wind from a thunderstorm hit causing the fire to actively burn towards the group from the south, southeast. UTV's were staggered in front of and behind the dozers as they made their way out in case they needed to leave a dozer behind to make a faster getaway. The fire gained in intensity and started to move towards the group at a rapid pace giving them a small window to get out. As they pushed on to the safety zone one of the dozers overheated and went down. The operator who had just undergone hip surgery could not walk very well so had to be helped along by the IHC crewmembers to the UTV. The other dozer was able to scratch a quick line around the dozer, but because of fire activity no other operations to safeguard the equipment were done. Once everyone was loaded, they took off to the safety zone where they parked the remaining operational dozer. Everyone continued from there to DP 101, instead of the safety zone due to its size and the fire behavior witnessed.  <br/><br/>Predicted weather for the day was an LAL of 6 and possible winds up to 40 MPH over the fire area due to thunderstorms. Before PSD operations you could visibly see cumulus clouds south of the fire area. No communication other than what was heard from the TFLD came across the division on primary air to ground. If another frequency was being heard or utilized for PSD operations, it was never given to the division personnel or in the communication plan in the IAP. No people or equipment were hurt or destroyed during the event, but given the weather, fire behavior from the PSD, and lack of communication an injury or fatality could have easily happened.","During this event, I had good communication with my two crewmembers, giving them constant weather and fire behavior updates throughout the situation. I was able to listen and observe their progress to the safety zone. I used this information to insure the safety of my hotshot crew and act as a repeater for communications to the individuals working their way out to the safety zone. Had I been given the proper frequencies, been advised of firing operations, and known the plan for firing operations, I feel this event could have been avoided.","07/28/2017 11:14"

It was a transition day. It was my day 14 and I had another DIVS shadowing me that day. At 0900 we took a recon flight of the division. The strategy of the 3 divisions at the head of the fire(I,J,K) was to construct indirect lines about 4-5 miles ahead of the fire, and bring the fire out of the heavier fuels and terrain with PSD operations, and either go direct or backline the indirect line we had already put in. DIV I and K were finished lining, going direct, and black lining their divisions by 7/7. On 7/6, 3 hotshot crews hand lit a section of black line and brought it do the I/J break. <br/><br/>When we took the recon flight, we noticed that the black line from the previous day did not consume that well. We had already begun a piece of indirect line that tied in a piece of direct line we had just completed to a piece of indirect that was completed 3-4 days prior. The indirect line operation was about 3-4 miles from any burning that took place on 7/6. During the recon we both decided that it would be safe to clean up some of the timber stringers that didn't burn from 7/6. The PSD operator was supposed to be at the helibase when we landed to do a face-to-face, but he was not there when we landed. I asked someone at helibase for the PSD operators # so I could call him and talk to him about the plan. <br/><br/>I drove out to DP 21, the closest place to the line on DIV J where I had cell phone service, and called him. I told him that we wanted to clean up some of the stringers that didn't burn in DIV I yesterday. He said he would get everything ready and get up in the air, or something to that effect. I drove from DP 21 out to the J/K break where the 3 hotshot crews on my division were parked. By the time I got out of my truck, the helicopter was in the air, and he was calling me on a discreet A/G frequency, which we had not previously agreed to talk on. He asked if I was ready to get started. I told him, we just want to start by cleaning up some of the stringers that didn't burn from the hand ignition the day before. He said 'you're coming across real scratchy'. I thought this was odd, because I have never heard someone in a helicopter say that to me before, but I said 'hang on, I'll try to get to a better place. It was perfect timing, but I ran into one of the supts. and he gave me a ride on a utv to a high point where I could keep an eye on the resources putting in the indirect line, and the PSD operation. <br/><br/>By the time I got to that high point, There was a line of fire that split the 3 mile section of unburned fuel, and now the concern was to get the resources putting indirect line to their safety zone. There were T-storms coming in, and we knew there would likely be downdrafts. I immediately called the PSD operator on the same discrete frequency and asked him to contact the TFLD working with the resources constructing the direct line, which was now a mile east of where the line of PSD balls were dropped, and now actively growing fire activity. The PSD operator tried calling him on the discreet A/G. I jumped on there and told him that no one has that frequency and he needs to use primary A/G. He called him on primary A/G and the TFLD asked him to bring any more fire their direction. He told him there are a lot of sparse fuels between them and the activity, and that everything is pulling in nicely. He said he was just going to clean up some stuff to the south of them and then he would be done. <br/><br/>As the division supervisor, I recognized that the PSD operator was doing his own thing and that we needed to get everyone out of the way. I was kind of in shock, at the time, by the lack of communication, and the carelessness I was witnessing.","Without doing a dry run or notifying anyone, the helicopter flew to the head of a drainage to the west of Blue Meadow, where 2 TFLDs, 2 Dozers with operators, 2 HEQBs, 2 safety officers, and 2 hotshot crew members were located. He was hovering very low and I tried to call the PSD operator to stop him, in case he was lighting that drainage. He told me to stand by. By this time, I had all my hotshot crews keep one foot in the black. 2 of the crews were going direct and 1 of them was prepping the very southern end of indirect line and was using the black as a safety zone as well. TFLD working with the dozers made the call to evacuate the indirect line. When the PSD operator called me back I asked him if he just dropped balls in there. He said yep, but were done, we're gonna head back, reconfigure and come back out to keep an eye on this for ya. As soon as the helicopter left we got downdrafts from the T-storms and the fire started to move at a high rate of speed up the middle fork drainage, which aligned perfectly with the escape route being used by the ground resources that were trying to evacuate. The dozer operators started pushing a safety zone in Blue Meadow. They did not feel they had enough time to use the escape route. The safety officers an 2 hotshot crew members were scouting the escape route ahead of them on UTVs. They instructed them to stop pushing, pick the blades up and start walking the dozers out. There was time, but they needed to hurry. One of the dozers broke down and the operator left it there and got a ride out on one of the UTVs. Everyone made it out safely and no equipment was damaged.

Crews quickly responded to the new starts, a particular set of fires started near Mayfield Idaho that posed the most risk to life and property.  These three fires were reported at 17:30 posing an immediate threat to life and property, Soles Rest subdivision was at greatest risk with approximately 20 primary residences.  Fire behavior was erratic with passage winds, high rates of spread were observed in grass and sage with 4-6' flame lengths.  Upon arrival at 18:00 all three fires were approximately 200 acres and were named the Breeze Fire.  One engine module consisting of two type 4 engines with superintendent, a dozer, a water tender, and a battalion chief were assigned to the fires.  The battalion chief took the role of Incident Commander and immediately ordered two additional engines, an additional dozer, and an air attack with SEATS to respond.  The initial resources were briefing on known hazards including oil and gas pipelines running through the fire area, which were identified by markers and a digital map layer which each resource had.  The superintendent was assigned to the dozer to help mitigate the potential of crossing pipelines and to improve safety measures associated with fire behavior and dozer operations. A Tesoro rep, which arrived on scene, was briefed on the plan of action and tied in with the superintendent to provide guidance on pipeline locations and risks.  With limited resources, the IC decided to utilize the dozers to go direct as possible and connect the three fires together firing any indirect line.  The second dozer on order was intended to be inserted strategically on the opposite end of the fire opposite side of the know pipe line.  The IC was briefed by the rep that the Tesoro line was shallow in the area, potentially only 20' deep. This information was passed to all resources which were instructed to not cross the line.  In further conversation the IC discovered there were two different pipeline companies with lines in the area (Williams Pipeline and Tesoro Pipeline).  The pipeline location layer was only released to the BLM by the Williams Pipeline company, not the Tesoro, which was only identified by rough locational markers.  At 20:20 the second BLM dozer arrived on scene and was briefed on hazards, line construction continued late into the evening eventually being completed at 21:45 stopping the progression of the fire at 1800 acres.  This left only one small gap over the pipeline which was secured by wet line.  Crews and equipment remained diligent throughout the incident to not cross pipelines keeping the incident staffed on both sides.  The day following the containment of the incident Tesoro reached out to the BLM stating that the rep, on more careful examination of the fire, realized their pipeline had been crossed by suppression equipment in two different locations.  These locations were not well defined by visual markers.","As the Incident Commander being familiar with the known hazards in my theater of operations I was sure to brief all resources on the pipelines and protocol associated with them.  The superintendent's primary mission was to identify pipeline hazards for dozer operations both visually on the landscape and through use of the map layers.  The two engines and additional dozer assigned to the incident were split providing support on each side of the pipelines to prevent a crossing.  Fires were connected with dozer line and fired to prevent segmentation of resources due to pipeline location having a lack of resources assigned with multiple fire starts.  It was fully believed that the incident went very smooth and all hazards were identified and mitigated until Tesoro reached out after the incident stating their line had been crossed by equipment.  The Williams Pipeline Company which has released their line location layer to the BLM was easily mitigated and not compromised.  I am currently pursuing the release of Tesoro's line location layer, which has been held from the BLM as sensitive information.  I have also made recommendations to Tesoro and Williams from a fire perspective on ways to help mitigate the very real risk to fire personnel around their line.  This includes the suggestion of prebuilt, pre identified crossing locations at set distances that are sufficient for dozer and engine crossing.  Primarily the 'Sensitive Line Location Layer' from Tesoro is desired, the Boise District BLM has been very successful in hazard mitigation with our current layer provided by the Williams Pipeline Company.","07/06/2017 15:00"

We log into 8 Initial Attack/Aircraft and 6 expanded computers every morning with dispatch generic profiles because we're interagency with BLM, BIA, and FS employees using the FS network. However, this morning around 1000 all our computers logged us out saying we needed to now use our linc pass credentials. We immediately contacted our local CIO help and he spent the rest of the morning getting our dispatch computer exemptions reinstated. Kevin informed us that after this summer, dispatch centers running on FS networks will not be able to have an exemption and CIO will require dispatch centers to login with linc card passes. We discussed the issue with non FS personnel, such as other dispatch agency employees (BLM/BIA/NPS/State/etc), AD’s,  militia folks, that come to help us and they would not be able to login to the computers. <br/> <br/>We expressed our concern to Kevin with the amount of AD’s and militia that are used in dispatch centers you need to have generic profiles. Kevin indicated that after this summer, a dispatch center FS employee would have to login using their linc card pass for each non FS individual. Obviously this raises security concerns with having multiple people logged in under one person’s profile. I personally do not want 14 people logged in under me. In interagency dispatch centers, you can’t always guarantee that a local FS dispatcher or even a local (other federal agency) dispatcher will be available to log people onto the computers. Many times we have non FS militia or again AD’s be our night dispatcher. That person works alone all night and according to Kevin would not be able to login without a FS dispatcher present to use their linc pass. He too agrees this is a serious concern for dispatch centers nationwide. <br/><br/>Additionally, we have a BIA employee that we’ve been trying to get a FS profile for the last two+ months. We’re still having problems with getting him a profile and he’s a regular Cody Dispatch employee that has to use the generic profile login. While our local CIO contact was working on our generic profile exemption, Hal was unable to assist with anything on the computers. We were fortunate that the morning resource check in rush had slowed down, I was able to document everything in our CAD system and fill ROSS orders. Had we been busier or a fire started requiring multiple resources especially aircraft it could have been a major disaster.  <br/> <br/>I know this issue has been brought up many times in the past and I thought we had figured it out with the dispatch exemptions. If there is a switch planned for this coming fall it really could impact dispatch operations nationwide.

Had he not been at work today who knows how long it would have been before someone at CIO got back to us. I've sent an email to Micheal Vigil, Liaison Fire/LEI for CIO, with the same verbiage.

Two different changes needed to happen, one a dispatcher could change and the other a radio tech needed to go into the programing with their computer and change a setting in order for it to recognize the Telex mic.  <br/>There were fire personnel on RX units, if Metcom was not able to cover for EICC this issue could have been detrimental to the safety of field going personnel. Notifications were made to fire resources via phone and were instructed to call EICC if able for check ins, otherwise EICC would monitor radios and Metcom would pick up any radio calls. <br/>Having no radio communication with fire personnel when they are out on units is not acceptable.","When our radios were not transmitting, Metcom took over all radio calls.  Notifications were made to supervisors/ FMOs and resources to call dispatch if needed, otherwise Metcom would take radio calls. <br/>All available radio technicians in the area were contacted, and messages were left for those who did not answer.  I had gotten a hold of one of the BLM radio techs, and he gave me a few options for troubleshooting with radio checks.  Nothing seemed to work.  <br/>Our FS tech called and said he was en route.  He worked with another FS tech over the phone and they figured out it was a default setting.  <br/><br/>Other issues we found were:<br/>Dispatch should not have even noticed the power outage due to back up generator.  EICC desk pods are connected to back up generator. <br/><br/>All computer, and radios should be hooked up to a uninterruptible power supply, or UPS. Only four of our computers were hooked up to outdated UPSs. <br/>Our radios were not hooked up to any UPSs.<br/><br/>The Center Manager of EICC and myself talked to our Fire Leadership and the Facilities Manager to first confirm we are still hooked up to the back up generator, and then if we could purchase new UPS's for each IA desk.  Our answer, yes to all.  It was confirmed, EICC was hooked up to the back up generator, but it takes 15-30 seconds to confirm a power outage has happened before it kicks on.  We had permission and a job code to purchase new UPSs, and chatted with someone from IT to get the right UPS to support what we needed. UPSs have been ordered. <br/>We have covered our power outage problem, but we have not fixed the program default issue.  That issue will remain with the radio techs to troubleshoot.","06/16/2017 11:21"

Hazard mitigation was proposed by the DIVS by utilizing 3 lookouts (which took needed manpower away from line construction) and a safety zone under an electric transmission line on the top of the ridge as an anchor point. I immediately had several reservations with acceptance of this assignment. When I demanded that I take the opportunity to examine the fuels & other factors in the proposed handline area, I was told no by the DIVS, that “it’s already been looked at.”<br/><br/>Shortly after arrival at the top along the transmission line, at the proposed drop-off into the drainage for the handline, I decided to refuse the assignment for the multiple Watch-Outs in play, other hazards, and overall risk involved.<br/>My time/distance estimate for escape route upslope to the safety zone indicated that the crew would have little chance to make it in the event of a fire run uphill towards our position. Additionally, it was determined by myself that escape downhill to a safety zone in the big meadow or clean black was not feasible due to the tangled mess of shrub fuels slowing forward progress of escape.<br/><br/>Watch Outs in effect for this assignment included:<br/><br/>3. Safety Zones and Escape Routes not identified<br/>	<br/>While a safety zone under the electric transmission line (de-energized) was proposed on top by the DIVS another safety zone downslope of the cutline was never talked about.<br/><br/>9. Building fireline downhill with fire below<br/>	<br/>The Mann Gulch tragedy was mentioned numerous times by the DIVS during discussion of the proposed handline. This led me to believe that the DIVS was aware of the hazards of the proposal. One suggestion by the DIVS to mitigate the hazards of the assignment was to employ 3 lookouts instead of 1. I was asked to provide a 3rd lookout and told the DIVS that it would be myself. After surveying the drainage from the top at the proposed drop-in point, I refused the assignment through discussing my concerns face-to-face with the TFLD. I then took position at the best lookout location for the entire drainage. While gathering weather data and an initial report of fire conditions in the drainage, I witnessed a backing fire to the south parallel with the slope with occasional single tree/group tree torching, uphill runs, and spotting. This observation was made at approximately 1045 hrs. The current fire behavior and weather was communicated to all division resources throughout the shift.<br/><br/>11. Unburned fuel between you and fire<br/>	<br/>Approximately 25% of the drainage on the south of Piney branch was actively burning with threats to crossing the branch at the bottom by 1100 hrs. 75% of the southern slope (where containment was the goal) had not yet burned. None of the northern side of the drainage had burned and I noted the east aspect of this side having a higher potential for ignition.<br/><br/>14. Weather becoming hotter and drier<br/>	<br/>The proposed handline construction in the drainage from the top was to take place into the peak of the burn cycle.<br/><br/>17. Terrain and fuels make escape to safety zones difficult<br/>	<br/>If forces were committed to the assignment in the drainage from the top, I estimated there would be insufficient time for escape back to the top based on slope. <br/><br/>The assignment’s similarity to previous tragedy wildland fires was obvious. Due to the level of risk involved and a multitude of violations to the basics of wildland fire safety rules, I had no choice but to refuse the assignment.","I made my concerns known to the TFLD and he agreed it was too risky. The TFLD talked to the DIVS Delta to inform him of multiple people expressing concern to the assignment. It was suggested and approved that 2 dozers would anchor off the fireline along the ROW and proceed into the drainage as far as possible while dozers would do the same from below. The DIVS did not object to this plan. <br/><br/>I continued to monitor the fire behavior from the lookout position and provide hourly weather reports. Helicopter work continued most of the day in the lower section of the drainage. The fire threatened to cross the drainage to the opposite slope at the lower end multiple times during the day. At approximately 1430 hrs the fire did cross the creek and was held in check by 2 dozers with 1 light helicopter in support.<br/><br/>Again I made my concerns known to the command staff including the safety officer after the shift. The morning of the next shift Delta DIVS asked our crews to construct line downhill from the top to connect the 2 dozer lines. Despite the occurrence of some light rainfall and very low fire behavior, I suggested to construct the line from below instead. He agreed with the plan and a successful handline was installed in approximately 7 hours to connect the upper & lower dozer lines in the drainage.<br/><br/>It was re-iterated to employ people in the DIVS position with requisite skills and experience to meet objectives without putting crews in harms’ way unnecessarily.","04/25/2017 10:30"

On the evening of Thursday April 13,2017 a module from another part of the state was dispatched with a check-in time of 0700 the next morning. I was the crew leader which consisted of 1 type-6 engine with 5 additional firefighters.<br/><br/>The fire had continued to prove troublesome to suppression efforts in extended attack the 2 operational shifts prior to our arrival. Our crew resources were assigned to division Delta and briefed in base camp & upon lining out. The DIVS ordered our crew to burn-out from the Charlie/Delta break south of Guys Run road down to the creek all the way back to state route 39.<br/><br/>We began ground ignition at the C/D break at approximately 0930 on April 13th. Upon starting of the firing operation, I noticed occasional single-tree torching of small hemlock trees near the line. There was little threat to escape at this time due to the higher fuel moisture content adjacent to the creek, time of day, more favorable weather conditions and little slope. Our crew was instructed by Delta DIVS to burn the line and have another crew member ignite inside the edge of the fire break in order to “pull heat off the line.” This was his tactic from the beginning of the operation. I was the crew leader as part of the holding forces following the ignition as it progressed up the line. As such, I was unable to view the ignition at all times. DIVS asked me to wet-mop 2 punky logs near the division break and monitor the area before proceeding forward along Guys Run road.<br/><br/>After refilling the type-6 at the ford near the division break, I was delayed from meeting up with the ignition crew due to the DIVS pickup blocking the road. I requested the TFLD to move the truck so I could rejoin the crew. When the truck was moved and I rejoined the crew, I noted the increased slope adjacent to Guys Run road & the drier fuels due to daylight on the transmission line right-of-way. I also noted the increased distance of unburned fuel between the holding line (Guys Run Rd) and the creek (where the fire was stopped previously.)<br/><br/>Our crew was taking direct instruction with extreme detail on how he wanted the burn-out performed from the beginning of the operational shift. The crew acted on the instructions of the DIVS. A crew member was instructed by the DIVS to enter the green some distance to “get more heat in there” in order to “pull heat off the line.” This crew member stopped ½ way across the transmission line ROW to ask if he should stop or keep going. The DIVS told him to keep going. 2 times in the morning of the first shift, crew members were asked to re-enter the area into the green to put more fire on the ground in order to “pull heat off the line.” One member refused due to safety concerns.<br/><br/>This action of attempting to “pull the heat off the line” by interior ignition coupled with line ignition (on direct orders of the Delta DIVS), was a primary causal factor in the division Delta blowout on Thursday morning. Secondary causal factors include (but not limited to): topography, insufficient holding resources & lack of air support. I was in & out of the ignition crews work area due to following the multiple instructions from the DIVS to monitor the beginning of the burnout and mop-up of certain areas. As crew leader, I failed to recognize what was about to unfold in time to stop it.<br/><br/>The blowout:<br/><br/>At the point where the crew member asked DIVS for feedback on whether he should stop ignition or keep going (& was instructed to keep going), the fire escaped containment of Guys Run Rd. E604 was in the area of multiple spot fires on the upslope side of Guys Run Rd so I proceeded the short distance to help with the holding effort. We were getting numerous spot fires on the upslope edge of the road as well as uphill from our location. Both of the type-6 booster hoses were deployed to assist with spot fire control. I was located behind the other type-6 & unable to move due to poor visibility, the blowout surrounding our position, and concern for running over a crew member on the road. I used a pre-attached whip line to extinguish the numerous spot fires underneath the engine. One crew member attempted to utilize the DIVS pickup’s water tank & pump but discovered it had a note on the pump switch that read: “DO NOT USE.” An attempt to turn it on regardless was futile. I witnessed multiple crew members upslope from the road attempting to extinguish the spot fires on the hill. The 2 booster hoses from both engines were pulled out to their limits of reach. I ordered VEHEMENTLT for all crew members to come back down to the road off the side of the hill as in my opinion, suppression of the spot fires was a battle we could not win with the resources on hand. Multiple spot fires burned together & shortly thereafter we witnessed AREA IGNITION of the hillside above Guys Run Rd.<br/><br/>All of the crew, including engine crews, were exposed to extreme convective & radiant heat, near flame impingement to the sides of the engines, heavy smoke, & extreme ember wash during the breakout due to the poorly executed & managed ignition operation.","Upon completion of our shift, I went directly to the command staff to relay my concern of the tactics used to attempt to meet our objective for the day and my safety concerns. I also recommended that burnout be completed at night time when fuel moistures and weather would be more in our favor. I also recommended a new DIVS with the requisite training and experience to manage a division on a mountain fire in Virginia. One more SAFENET will be filed for events that took place on the next operational shift on the same division.","04/25/2017 10:29"

No of the crew sustained any injuries.  All supervising personnel were immediately contacted followed by the LAMR Law Enforcement who came out to take an official report. While waiting for the Law Enforcement Ranger the crew removed the light bar to prevent any further damage to the engine.","This was the first assignment of the year for this engine and crew. While daily vehicle inspections were conducted per S.O.P. no one had physically checked the mounting hardware for the light bar. The crew also questions the validity of 4 sheet metal screws into the roof of the vehicle as a legitimate mounting method. Further inspections and conversations will be conducted with the home unit FMO upon crew's return on 3/26/2017 about this incident. <br/><br/>It is recommended to all personnel who have a top mounted emergency light bar to check the mounting before the fire season gets underway.","04/14/2017 09:07"

This model of fire engine is on the chassis of a 2009 Ford F550 with a 6.4L Powerstroke Diesel Engine.  <br/><br/>On March 17, 2017  the plan was for the engine crew to do project work while maintaining readiness for initial attack.  The route to the project site included some steep hill climbs on state hwy roads; these roads were paved and normal commuting highways.  While climbing one of these steep hills, the engine dramatically lost power resulting in a change of speed from 50MPH to 20MPH in less then 5 seconds.  There was no warning light or dash board sensor that precluded this loss of power, all gauges were within normal operating ranges.  <br/><br/>After the power loss the truck displayed 'Reduce Engine Power' on the dashboard display and a wrench symbol.  The truck was not able to operate above 20 mph, and with no power to climb hills at any speed. <br/><br/>Diagnosis of Issue:<br/><br/>Engine oil had overheated enough that the EGR system failed resulting in the need to replace 2 EGR Sensors, Fan Clutch, Water Pump, and Gaskets.   <br/><br/>Concerns/Potential Issues:<br/><br/>In wildland fire and prescribed fire operations engine crews, and other line  operators, rely on the capabilities of their equipment to preform to the minimum standard.  Vehicles must be able to operate across a full spectrum of environments that includes usage for escape route travel, time sensitive critical holding or firing operations, life safety (Both Government and Private), and a myriad of other functions.  For a vehicle in an emergency situation to go into a 'Reduced Engine Power' mode is extremely dangerous.<br/><br/>There are a couple of scenarios that are extremely dangerous should this have occurred under different circumstances:<br/><br/>1. Reduced engine power/speed could lead to the entrapment or burn over of a vehicle thereby directly putting fire fighters at high risk who are relying on that vehicle.<br/><br/>2. This could occur at freeway speeds where a sudden loss of power/speed could lead to increased risk of a high speed vehicle accident, potentially involving multiple vehicles or roll over.  This puts firefighters and the public at high risk. <br/><br/>3. Loss of a resource that fire managers are relying on to provide initial attack or extended attack operations. This reduces the capability and effectiveness of fire managers to provide an adequate response to emerging incidents.","I am not aware of any corrective action that can be put in place for this type of mechanical failure.","07/06/2017 14:55"

All districts, out of necessity have developed internal procedures to evaluate/correct/identify deficiencies and coordinate with CIO staff to resolve. This includes FAM personnel identifying and fixing errors caused by CIO oversights in radio programming. <br/><br/>CIO staff being overtasked/worked thus reducing critical organization skills and scheduling needed to perform above tasks prior to field going season.<br/><br/>Lack of expediency to replace aging/broken equipment, thus compounding needed repairs and situations to field going staff, putting responders in difficult situations.<br/><br/>Responders lack overall confidence in CIO programing/global settings, and overall support from CIO.  Past programing/settings efforts by CIO staffs has resulted in numerous errors being identified by forest FAM staff.  Some responders have responded out side the local forest area to incidents across the west with incorrect settings/programming.  Thus causing an uncertainty/confidence with mobile and hand held equipment.  Instances of responders having to have the communications unit at the incident correct or fix issues.<br/><br/>Severe weather conditions this past winter have contributed to the lack of function with most, if not all repeaters on the north end of the forest.  Fire and field going personnel have no mechanism to communicate while engaged in normal and emergency activities.","Immediate corrective actions taken and recommendations:<br/><br/>Forest FAM staff identified incorrect programming/setting issues and communicated with CIO staff the resounding issues.<br/><br/>This past winter/spring Forest FAM staff elevated concerns/conversations with CIO staff and Forest Supervisor.<br/><br/>Recommendations:<br/><br/>Create a out of region CIO task force of such to visit the Forest and help current CIO identify deficiencies and prioritize corrective actions.<br/><br/>Identify upper level CIO Director/Supervisor to evaluate and confirm final programming/settings for distribution.<br/><br/>Create an annual Communications Preparedness review criteria to implement prior to field season.

In the areas without heat, we were in fairly heavy suppression repair (rehab) mode with a lot of moving parts - 'Iron and Heavy Metal' in the form of excavators, skidders, dozers, road graders, and low boy tractor-trailers. <br/><br/>Our safety record was very good, with no major accidents or serious injuries, and only a few minor incidents. We had IMT Safety Briefings and Group and Division Breakouts after the formal briefings daily. During the suppression mode, many of the old skid and logging roads were opened as control lines, including many areas cross-country without roads and/or cutting off switchbacks. As in any fire suppression operation, many trees were bulldozed and/or cut by Falling Teams and/or Hand Crews, both for the actual fireline construction and to mitigate 'hazard trees.' <br/><br/>The Repair Group had completed their assignments in several of the other Divisions which were fairly 'cold' and without mop-up duties in the lower elevations and were now moving into the higher elevations with denser fuels and more 'heat' in them.<br/><br/>There were several, out-of-region Resource Advisors (READ's) working with both groups throughout their respective assignments, but mainly with the Repair Group. At this point, all the READ's were under the 'guidance' of a LEAD READ, an out-of-region Forest Service employee. There were also several other out-of-region READ's as well. There was another READ from the local area that  was very knowledgeable with the area and many of the local equipment operators engaged in the Repair Operation. She had good leadership skills and was actually taking a strong interest and lead in the repair because of her local District ties and the lack of leadership from the LEAD READ.<br/><br/>The LEAD READ apparently did not like this set-up. He went to OPS  on three separate occasions and told him: 'I'm going to pull the safety card.' OPS said the LEAD READ also apparently had some personal issues with the local READ. Regarding the local READ, the LEAD READ told OPS on three occasions, 'I want her off this fire ...' It was clear at this point, that personal animus was overriding any ostensible leadership objectivity.<br/><br/>The Tower Group and Repair Group Division Supervisors (DIVS) and local READ called a meeting at Drop Point (DP) 25 on September 15th and invited me along. I felt it was a very productive meeting. After this meeting, the two READs that were present told the LEAD READ that the meeting was somewhat 'argumentative' or 'confrontational' - I don't recall the exact word used.<br/><br/>One of the complaints to OPS, from the READs, including the LEAD READ, was that we were intentionally cutting 'hazard trees' so that we could salvage them. The Forest Resources Group had approved decking the trees we had removed during the line construction and hazard tree removal phases for salvage. At some point during this, there was 'some questions' about what a hazard tree was. This developed into another issue involving the Forest Leadership, READ's, OPS, and Safety. It was resolved when the IMT Safety met with the Forest Leadership and emphasized the extensive hazard tree issue on thie fire, especially the Cedars, which entailed about 95% of our hazard trees. He also emphasized the national-level hazard tree history and the on-going fatalities due to these 'hazard trees.' At no time were we cutting trees, hazard or otherwise, just so we could deck them for salvage removal. One of the READs also claimed he/she was almost 'squished' by one of the skidders during one of the Repair operations, however, I was unable to talk to this READ about any details because I was notified of this alleged incident by cell phone text after I was demobbed from the fire. Moreover, I was informed that three of the salvage log decks had burned up, apparently from heat/fire still inj some of the decked trees.<br/><br/>Given that several of the READs were not Fire Suppression personnel, it appeared to me that they were definitely not accustomed to the experienced Fire Suppression personnel's manner of very direct communications, disagreements, sometimes assertive negotiating, and often aggressively working matters out to a satisfactory compromise, to get the daily tasks accomplished in a safe, efficient, and timely manner. The operators (Private Contractors) were not Government employees, so they were accustomed to getting things done in the most costly and efficient ways. Most times, the operators had the best ideas to accomplish the tasks when given leader's Intent by the Group Leaders. Unfortunately, the READs interpreted all this 'aggression' as being unsafe and passed it onto the LEAD READ without bring it up to or discussing it with those allegedly involved, e.g. the Group Leaders, OPS, or any of the several Safety Officers. The LEAD READ finally brought the issue to OPS's attention when he decided to 'pull the safety card' and the fact that he wanted the READ Hydrologist 'off the fire.' <br/><br/>The entire Kaniksu Complex from its earliest stages was a safe operation without accident or serious injury and only minor incidents.<br/><br/>My delayed filing is due to recently returning from extended fire assignments in the Pacific Northwest and the SAFNET system being inoperable intermittently when I had the time to file one.","Talked with OPS and the other Group Leaders and the Local District Hydrologist READ about the LEAD READ and other READ's alleged safety concerns. Will endeavor to spend more time working with READs in the future to avoid similar incidents.

These safety concerns will be addressed below. The IC of the incident responded to this turn down by stating 'I am the boss, you work for me and you will do what I say. And I am saying go in there and go direct!' In response to this the crews still refused the assignment and were sent to another division the following day and remained on those divisions for the remainder of the assignment.<br/>      Division Delta on the Tepee Springs fire featured large tracts of private land mixed with State, Forest Service, and BLM land. A large elk ranch lay in the middle of the division and was the epicenter of the issues. The land owners, on multiple occasions expressed frustration towards fire fighters with their suppression actions which ranged from verbal threats to aggressive posturing. LEO’s were called on multiple occasions and the incident eventually resulted in two of the land owners verbally accosting a BLM employee while armed with a weapon. The land owners made multiple unsafe demands to fire fighters such as downhill line construction in extremely rugged terrain with fire below them, attempting burnouts on mid-slope dozer lines with no escape routes or safety zones, and to drop water from helicopters with personnel in the work zone (the land owners). During at least one documented occasion the land owners took it upon themselves to attempt a burnout and began igniting fire below crews without any communication or warning. Crews had to be pulled to safe areas during this. Other unsafe suppression actions by the land owners were extremely fast driving, attacking fires at the head, felling trees in the middle of crews, and operating dozers on federal and state land with no communication with fire resources.  In addition to the ill-advised suppression actions their continued harassment of fire line personnel in an attempt to force their own initiatives distracted important leaders from their primary jobs of managing people as well as the entire division and the fire as a whole. These issues were brought to the land owner’s attention and were met with little to no regard for fire fighters safety as long as we stop the fire where it was at. On countless occasions attempts were made to explain the reasons behind our tactics and the safety guidelines that we operate under. The issues with the land owners were passed up the chain of command on multiple occasions.<br/>     The night of the armed verbal assault by the land owners the entire division was evacuated and night resources were instructed to not enter the area. The decision was made by Operations, Branch, and DIVS that no personnel would be re-engaged on the division due to the escalating violent behavior shown by the land owners. Government equipment and supplies would be retrieved under LEO escort at a later time and no personnel would be exposed to the serious safety issues present. In the meantime, the IC met with the landowners regarding suppression activities on their property and the adjacent land. The IC was joined by the IC (T), Branch I, and the Liaison officer as well as local law enforcement.  The IC did not request to speak to any of the agency individuals involved in the incidents of the prior days, but rather told the land owner that four hotshot crews would put in a “check line” on their property less than 24 hours after the owners assaulted an employee while armed with a pistol. He also made this promise without including Operations, who was still under the understanding that the division would go forth with the plan agreed to in the morning. No representation from Safety was present, either. <br/>     The IC, IC (T), Branch, Liaison, DIVS, DIVS (T), and leadership from 4 IHC crews met to discuss the plan. The directive was to put in a “check line” on the land owners property and end the line somewhere out in the green at an undetermined location. A liaison officer would be used to talk to the land owners. Two of the IHC’s turned down the assignment due to safety concerns with the land owner’s erratic and escalating behavior as well as doubts about the tactical sense of the plan as compared to its political purposes. Two crews agreed to attempt the plan, citing that they had not been personally exposed to the land owner’s actions, but added that they will disengage if they felt threatened at all. Upon hearing the denial of his plan the IC responded angrily with 'I am the boss, you work for me and you will do what I say. And I am saying go in there and go direct!' He showed little regard for the safety concerns brought up and could not promise that the land owners would behave appropriately. The liaison officer who was present stated several times that he had been shot at and his house and work had been bombed, but you had to give it a try. He said he could not guarantee that the land owners would not take their anger to the next level, but you have to try. The two IHC’s again turned down the assignment.<br/>     After the IC, Branch, Liaison, and IC (T) left the crews discussed their plan of action and the two IHC’s that turned down the assignment stayed at camp while the other two crews engaged on the “check line.” The use of an LEO at the work site was denied because in the words of the IC “we brought guns a few days ago (by ordering an LEO after being verbally threatened) and that made them (owners) bring guns to show us they had them too.” During the next 3 shifts the crews engaged on the check line with no reported injuries. The land owners at times worked between the crews mopping up and felling trees (on federal property) and the crews mitigated this by assigning a crew member with a radio to alert the crew of falling trees and other hazards.  <br/>     Crews were put in hazardous and volatile situations without proper mitigations allowed to be implemented, such as mandatory evacuations and LEO’s. Political pressures were put in front of on the ground decisions and fire line personnel safety. Ego was put ahead of common sense and crew safety. Finally, leadership was non-existent to poor from numerous positions in the chain of command.","I gave crews the option to engage or not engage and to disengage if they felt uncomfortable. I requested LEO presence, but was only allowed to stage them at a spike camp 40 minutes away. Avoided land owners by locating myself at a parking spot on federal land and out of the way. Staged medics at various areas with quick response times to crews. Worked with Liaison officer to explain to land owners our intentions and limitations. Spoke to IC about his inappropriate actions and lack of leadership.","09/22/2015 14:52"

This was addressed in the spring of 2010 with overhead in the CIO organization through Forest-wide meetings; this issue was brought up in the Saddle Prescribed Fire Burn Injury Lessons Learned report (p. 7). This incident happened within 10 air miles of the Pinto Point Fire. With winter fast approaching and additional resources doing their normal jobs where poor communications could quickly lead to life threatening situations, it is imperative that some corrective actions be sought out immediately. I think 12 working days since my initial report filing is more than adequate time for a phone call or an email updating what is being talked about. If no action is taken by November 30, 2015 I will be forced to pull together a communications plan to disseminate to local and national media outlets and make my case publicly on behalf of the employees of the Kootenai National Forest and those working on our Forest from other locales. I am invoking my rights to pull my 'Safety Card'. I will not stop until meaningful changes are made and the Forest Service with their so called 'Safety Culture' takes their responsibilities for employee safety seriously.","These were reported in the previous SafeNet described above.","12/04/2015 07:45"

I personally witnessed the following events for the 3 days I was present on the fire.  I want to clarify that I will be discussing the Oregon RFPA (not the Owyhee RFPA...nor any members of Owyhee REFP that are from Oregon).<br/><br/>During initial attack (and extended attack) the Jordan Valley (Oregon) RFPA responded to the Soda Fire -- the fire was in Idaho.  Idaho and Oregon have NO AGREEMENT for this to occur.  The reason that there is no agreement is that Oregon RFPA declined to meet the standards that Idaho has set in place for safety and effective cooperative operations.  The standards are very basic but extremely critical for personal and public safety.  These standards include:<br/><br/>1.  Basic Fire Training (S130/190)<br/>2.  PPE<br/>3.  Common Communications and integrated into ICS<br/><br/>The Oregon RFPA, from the initial time that I arrived on scene took independent action on the fire. They did not participate under ICS and work with common objectives to suppress the fire. <br/> <br/>There was no common communication with the incident and no ability to create common frequencies. <br/><br/>Adequate/appropriate PPE was not worn by the Oregon RFPA members.<br/><br/>There were children on scene with Oregon RFPA members initial attacking the fire.<br/><br/>There was no way to have accountability as to who was on scene and where the Oregon RFPA was taking action.  The members did not tie into ICS for assignments or supervision.<br/><br/>Backfires were lit without permission or knowledge by the DIVSs, Operations, or IC.  <br/><br/>There were RFPA members actively fighting fire long after the initial attack time-frame had passed (3 days after the fire ignited). Interagency Standards for Fire and Fire Aviation Operations 08-12<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to add that in no way am I saying that the Oregon RFPA doesn't have good intentions.  They are good people with good intentions.  HOWEVER, the decisions and independent actions that the Oregon RFPA took on the Soda Fire put themselves, firefighters and the public at great risk of serious injury or fatality.  BLM also is taking on a huge amount of liability by continuing to work with and or allow the Oregon RFPA to conduct suppression actions on BLM lands under their current culture.<br/><br/>We (Federal/State/County/RFPA) must work together under a unified, single organization to be successful.  Anything less is an unacceptable risk.  We have a model in Idaho for that to happen with RFPAs, and it has been extremely successful.  Oregon RFPAs could be a force multiplier -- but under the current mode of operation, simply put, they are dangerous.","I pursued face-to-face communications with every Oregon RFPA member that I could find.<br/><br/>I gave my extra King Radio to an Oregon RFPA member and asked him to stay on private ground at a structure that needed support (to make sure it didn't burn down after the fire had already gone through).  I let him know I couldn't ask him to help on any part of the fire that was on federal ground due to policy.  I asked him to stay in contact with me.  He stayed in contact with me for several hours but did not notify me when he left (and I did not hear from him again).<br/><br/>I asked Oregon RFPA members to put on PPE.<br/><br/>I found a backburn that was started independent of any direction or knowledge by me on my Division and had to scramble to incorporate what had been started into my tactical plan.","08/20/2015 07:41"

The mission of the RFPA is to provide aid in the form of fire resources and personnel to assist agency leaders and firefighters.  Idaho RFPA members have received basic fire training, and are required to have PPE on.  They have been instructed during their training to acquire a supervisor, assignment, and have communications (freq.), before engaging a fire.  If these things are not corrected LCES is not in place, and can result in serious accidents or fatalities. <br/> <br/>Some of the things I witnessed:<br/><br/>1.Oregon RFPA members had no PPE.<br/>2.Oregon RFPA members taking independent burnout actions with no communication.<br/>3.An Oregon RFPA member that did not speak English, or know how to use his radio.<br/>4.Kids and other public members out with the Oregon RFPA members on the fire line.<br/>5.When given an assignment an Oregon RFPA member stated he wanted to work the other flank because he had land on that side of the fire.<br/>6.Open containers of alcohol on the fire line.<br/>7.Oregon RFPA members were outside of their I.A. boundary.<br/>8.Oregon RFPA members traveling to the fire line in unburnt fuel.<br/>9.Oregon RFPA members on the fire line past extended attack.<br/>10.Oregon RFPA members working the fire line without checking in, getting a briefing, or even the DIVS knowing where they were.<br/>11.Oregon RFPA members share no common tactical frequencies with Idaho, and have radios that cannot be programed in the field.","All of these issues can be corrected on boundary fires by having a national standard for RFPA members.  PPE needs to be issued and worn, training and refreshers completed, and better radios supplied (with multiple groups).  The RFPA members need to check into an incident, and get a breifing.  They need to have a supervisor, assignment, and have communications (freq.), before engaging a fire.","08/20/2015 07:41"

The state federal agencies have made a lot of progress with the ranching community to form the RFPA.  Collaborative efforts have been made for training of these groups, within our state, which have covered ICS, Communications, Tactics, Personnel Protective Equipment, etc...  I am not sure if this is covered by the neighboring state RFPAs.<br/><br/>Most the issues were during the first three days of initial attack.  The fire grew to 6500 acres within first 5 hours, 78,000 acres in the next 24 hours, and 130,000 acres in the next 24 hours.<br/><br/>On this incident we had in state and out of state RFPA groups and local citizens all taking action.  The in state RFPA for the most part was very cooperative, supportive and helpful in our efforts.  The out of state RFPA and local citizens were for the most part difficult, combative and engaged in independent action which put many people in harm’s way, and made suppression efforts more difficult in an already very stressful, dangerous and complex environment.<br/>Examples:<br/>#1- Multiple ignition attempt sent head fire to control lines, accelerating action by igniting base of slopes when fire behavior was backing slowly and not a priority.  These ignition tactics where not thought thru and were performed with no anchor points, nothing to tie the fire into and no containment lines in place.  <br/>#2- Individuals starting back firing on an inadequate two-track roads between the fire front and the highway (our control line), which easily jumped the two-track road and sent head fire to the highway, in front the main fire before black lines could be established, putting every person, vehicle, structure in danger.  This particular head fire easily crossed the highway and proceeded to burn out of control and threaten multiple structure and critical habitat.<br/><br/>These actions continued to stretch our already limited resources and make for an unsafe environment. None these actions were communicated to a fire line supervisor, overhead or to adjoining forces, putting everyone in the area in a high risk and chaotic environment.","When given the opportunity, I pulled ranchers and RFPA members aside and advised them to stop putting fire on the ground unless directed to, utilize incident frequencies (most didn’t have radios), if not with an RFPA (most individual said they were affiliated with an out of state RFPA), which I could not verify, I ask them to leave the area and would run into them at another critical part of the incident.    I made an effort to keep them close so I could monitor their actions, but that didn’t work either. State LEOs weren’t sure how they could help the situation, and were not familiar with an incident of this type or magnitude.  <br/><br/>We are very lucky not have someone hurt or killed on this incident from one of these groups.  If these groups want to be helpful they will need to be properly trained, understand ICS, know how to operate their radios and use proper communication, have proper PPE, never put fire on the ground unless directed by someone with the authority and communicate action to all adjourning forces, etc...","08/21/2015 07:36"

We checked in and received a briefing from Battalion Chief (BC) with the following:<br/>The fire was caused by a lightning strike the previous afternoon and was in drainage below Cahto Peak. A mix of available personnel (USFS engine, Helitack, a Golf crew and an assembled crew of available firefighters) had worked the fire overnight and estimated it to be 20-40 acres. Due to the fire's position below Cahto Peak and the communications equipment on top, it was important to contain the fire quickly. Battalion Chief reminded us of the Lodge Lightning Complex of the previous year in the same area. Logistical support was discussed.<br/>We briefed our crews on the assignment given and route of travel to the fire. We discussed the Lodge Fire of the previous year, which some 5031C members had been assigned to and remembered there had been a burn over of personnel. We proceeded to the fire and met and briefed with the IC. IC advised that crews had worked all night and needed food and water, the fire was still an estimated 20-30 acres and a heavy helicopter was working the fire to keep it in check. Our assignment was to take hose packs and extra food and water in to complete the hose lay around the fire and replenish the food and water of the crews on scene. Crews had made the hose lay to the fire's edge, but were unsure how much hose it would take to completely contain the fire. We discussed fire activity, lookouts, escape routes, safety zones, how much of the fire was actually lined, the possibility of sling loading logistical supplies in and emergency extraction of personnel, if injured.<br/>Fire activity had been moderate, with occasional flare ups and rollout of burning material. A type 1 helicopter was actively working the fire continuously. The escape route was the fire line into the fire from the top, which was a 20-30 minute walk in and a 1-2 hour hike out over loose rock and stobs.  We guessed it to be a 1200' vertical climb. They were using 'the black' as their safety zone. There was no helispot, but an area they planned to use as a sling site for delivering drinking water. There was a helicopter hoist ship available for medevac, but was not NVG capable, so injuries after dark would have to be walked or carried out.<br/>After briefing, we assembled all 5031C personnel and walked to the start of the fire line to look at the fire line, fire activity and discuss the line out of tools for personnel to carry. I was very uneasy with what I saw (steep climb over rocky ground and a solid fuel bed of 8-12' brush and trees with no visible open ground) but did not immediately voice my concerns. I consulted with STEN(t)  and our most experienced personnel to see if they had the same concerns. We were joined by Orange County strike team (OCST) at some point in this assessment. The plan was for us to work together throughout the night. STEN(t) OCST and I made eye contact and walked a few feet away from other personnel to share our concerns. His first words were ' I think we are thinking about the same things', to which I replied 'yes, I am not comfortable with what I see right now and don't want to commit personnel until I have sent some of my experienced guys down to confirm what we have been told' He agreed. I conferred with STEN 5031C(t) and we decided to send the IHC captain and an IA crew boss (IACB) to scout the fire and report, while we prepared the rest of the crew to begin the hike down the fire line. We had to drop equipment at the fire line beginning and shuttle engines to a staging area on another peak due to very limited parking area. Engine crews assembled fire line packs, all 50 hose packs carried on our engines, tools and all 5 saws in preparation to begin work, once the fire had been scouted. STEN(t) then discussed the Downhill line checklist, Fire Orders and Watch Out Situations with the IHC captain and IACB and sent them down the line to scout.  Another captain followed IHC captain and IACB to an area that initial attack crews had used as a vantage point to act as Lookout (call sign 31c lookout).  This captain met with lookouts in place, discussed LCES and asked about the current escape route(s) and safety zone. He was told the only escape route was the fire line into the fire and there was no designated Safety Zone. During this time, we monitored radio traffic from crews in place, who were dealing with flare ups (which produced significant smoke production in several spots) and roll out, which they said they had contained. The helicopter continued to work continuously on the flare ups. The fire was divided into Alpha and Zulu divisions. I was concerned that DIVS Alpha did not answer radio traffic multiple times from the IC and the helicopter working the fire and asking for direction on drops. I remember the helicopter pilot sounding frustrated saying something to the effect ' Ok, I will sit here and spin holes in the sky until someone gives me something to do' I wondered why Alpha did not answer (noise, radio issues, etc.) but my gut was that he was very fatigued from the all night firefight. This also made me doubt the accuracy of the information on fire size and progress made we had been given.<br/>As the scouts walked and mapped the fire line with GPS, he discovered the following:<br/>1.There was open line he had been told was completed.<br/>2.The Golf crew told him they were using a rocky drainage bottom for a Safety Zone, which he did not feel was acceptable.<br/>3.He found the most heat and 4 places with rollout in DIVS Alpha. He cleaned and improved line as he went.<br/>4.He spoke with every crew leader he met on the fire line that may have been a DIVS, but none identified themselves as a DIVS.<br/>5.After scouting and mapping, he recommended we refuse the assignment based on lack of an acceptable Safety Zone and the Escape Route was a 45 minute hike minimum through heavy brush.<br/>6.He relayed by radio that, in his opinion there was no 'good black' for a Safety Zone and there was 'massive potential' for re-burn.<br/>The three captains and STEN(t) met at the Lookout point and discussed Fire Orders, Watch Outs and what they had found for 15-20 minutes and could not come up with a way to safely engage.<br/>Based on our assessment, we met with IC and refused the assignment. We discussed the lack of a Safety Zone. He asked if we were looking for a 'textbook, 4 times flame height Safety Zone' and we replied, no, we understand that is not possible, but we need something workable. We discussed the possibility of getting a dozer down to the fire and were told they had scouted for that, but it was not possible. IC asked for our official reasons for turning down the assignment and we told him lack of an adequate Safety Zone and Escape Route. He phoned Branch IV and relayed our refusal. Branch IV requested STEN(t) phone him immediately. STEN(t) phoned and discussed our assessment and that we felt it was unsafe to engage. Branch IV requested that we 'make it safe' STEN(t) replied that it would take many hours to cut a Safety Zone with the full crew, during which time we would not have a Safety Zone. <br/>We discussed the fire activity and the fact that there had been little RH recovery overnight the previous night, but that there was a chance of the marine influence moving in over the fire tonight. We observed onshore flow for a while, but the layer stopped well short of the fire and did not seem to progress further.<br/>The strike team also sent 6 personnel with hose packs to scout the fire, but did not feel it was safe to immediately engage. They did shuttle a dozen or so hose packs down to stage at the lookout point, approximately 300 yards below the beginning of the fire line. IC asked us to also shuttle hose packs down the fire's edge, but we refused because we felt it was not safe to do so. It was now approximately 2200 hours and we were told to return to the staging area on another peak for the night. By the time we loaded and shuttled all personnel and equipment and returned to the staging area, it was approximately 2330 hours. We conducted an AAR on the day's events with all personnel and our reasons for turning down the assignment. One captain shared his experiences of walking the ground of many fatal fires and the common denominators found at each. He also spoke of the fire fatalities on the Rattlesnake Fire of 1953 on the Mendocino National Forest, where 15 firefighters were killed while trying to outrun a fire in dense brush in steep terrain. We gave everyone an opportunity to speak and we bedded down around 0015 hours. <br/>STEN(t) and myself did not sleep that night. We went over the day's events, decisions made and alternatives available to us at length and then sat in silence pondering our actions. Personally, I felt bad  for not being able to assist the crews that had been working for 30 plus hours without relief and that I had no experience in that region or fuel type to offer any workable solutions for engagement. I have felt uncomfortable on previous incidents, but had always been able to come up with workable solutions to engage. This is the first assignment I have refused. Although it was the right decision for me, as a firefighter and knowing that others had engaged, it does not sit well. I texted our duty chief and discussed our assignment and subsequent refusal. <br/>The next morning, after oncoming and off going resources completed movement, Branch IV arrived and asked that the STEN be assembled for discussion. He said he was 'pissed' and was visibly so. He proceeded to alternatively dress us down for not engaging due to a steep, nasty hike, inferring we were lazy and commending us for making the decision to refuse based on our training and experience. He stated that we had cost him a day of progress and that he needed this fire put to bed. He reminded us that we were a type 3 crew, just like anyone else and were expected to work. He said we should be ashamed and embarrassed to walk by those who had worked the line when we had not. He asked us to re-evaluate our decision to engage this morning and he returned to his vehicle. STEN(t) and I followed him to his vehicle to continue the discussion.  He again alternated between dressing us down and praising us for a difficult decision. He said (paraphrased) 'If, based on your honest opinion and your training and experience, you felt the assignment was unsafe, I commend you for the decision' to which I replied 'that's exactly where I am at' <br/>I absolutely understand his frustration, but feel it was unprofessional to dress down the entire crew based on his assumption, or the opinion of the IC. He should have addressed STEN(t) & myself privately. Based on the fact that nothing had changed overnight relative to an adequate Escape Route or Safety Zone, and our feeling that our concerns were not given consideration, we immediately refused the request and asked to be reassigned.","Refused assignment we considered unsafe after discussing possible alternatives with the IC.","09/23/2015 07:39"

Fuels were native bunchgrasses, cheatgrass, Pinon/Juniper, and sagebrush.  Terrain was too steep for engines to perform mobile attack.  Engine crews and jumpers divided the two flanks and began line construction.  While performing regular chainsaw hotline construction, the chainsaw wouldn't start after having been turned off for 15 minutes and had rested in the green, but in direct sun.

These radios allow cloned groups to be tone select and tone programmed, however, the DPH models approved for federal cooperators on these fires do not allow this.  For at least the first week of this fire (Rocky Incident) the clone provided to all personnel on the fire had this incompatible mix, the result being that the tone select command channel did not function (personnel could hear traffic but could not reply).  I became aware of this issue when attempting to communicate with a Branch Director on the fire on 8/2/2015.  I was ultimately able to contact the Branch Director on my mobile radio, which had the command channel programmed in one of my home groups.  I discussed the issue with a member of the fire team's communications unit the next day, and indicated that this was likely a problem with every other federal cooperator on the incident and that the simplest way to address the issue would be to add a channel to the clone group, allowing both command tones (there were two repeaters on the fire for command) to be pre-programmed.  I also discussed this issue with the local unit BLM FMO who was previously unaware of the issue.  Finally, on or about 8/5/2015 a new clone was offered that resolved the issue.  I am not aware of this having been an issue in the past, but now with all CAL FIRE Tac, CALCORD, V-Tac and V-fire frequencies being tone protected I expect that any large fire with multiple repearter tones for command may have a similar potential for this critical communication failure.","See above.","08/25/2015 08:08"

The radio communication was marginal at best and took numerous attempts to relay information to dispatch due to the barley readable communication due to lack of radio repeater coverage. The potential issue was poor or no communication with Dispatch from the fire location in the event of an emergency or critical request with poor communication not being established.  Cell phone coverage was not good enough as well to use as a work around combined with the lack of radio coverage for communication.  This could have resulted in a safety issue.","A call was made to the local forest radio technician about the issue of poor radio repeater coverage in the fire area and requested a portable repeater to be installed to improve radio communication.  I was also notified of several existing repeaters being down/not working in area which again did not help matters. A work around plan had to be put into place with human repeaters, Sattalite phone and the local forest radio technician was not going to be available to assist due to a personal logistics issue he had to leave town for so he requested a neighboring forest radio technician to assist us with the portable radio repeater install.  The portable radio repeater set-up took a total of 3 days to install due to lack of local knowledge of base stations, repeater link set ups, frequencies issues and dispatch console set-up.  After days of trouble shooting issues the portable repeater was finally programed correctly, installed in a good location and radio communications improved dramatically and provided adequate coverage for the fire area.  Location, operation or lack there of existing radio repeaters needs to be addressed at the local, forest and regional level regardless of funding issues that seems to outweigh providing good radio coverage and communication which can and will cause safety issues in the near future if not addressed seriously.","08/11/2015 07:49"

The fire was jumped by two BLM smokejumpers at 1715.  The chainsaw used for this IA was a Stihl 200T,  which is a smaller arborist chainsaw frequently used in Great Basin Smokejumper operations.  The saw was initially used by one jumper to cut limbs off of a large juniper that had fire burning in and around it.  The saw functioned for a short period(less than half a tank) before quitting.  The jumper was unable to diagnose the problem and continued his work with a handsaw.  Approximately 20 minutes after the saw had been put down I arrived at the fire and attempted to diagnose the issue.  I decided to fill the tank with gas from a MSR fuel bottle.  All proper precautions were taken during fueling.  However it was noticed while pouring the fuel from the bottle into the chainsaw's tank that the fuel was bubbling, similar to soda coming from a fountain.  After filling the tank I began to secure the cap onto the MSR fuel bottle.  About two turns into securing the cap the saw gas began to profusely shoot out of the vent holes located on the cap.  I then threw the bottle a safe distance away and witnessed the fuel continue to vent out the cap for a couple a seconds.  After the fuel stopped venting I picked up the bottle and secured the cap.  In an attempt to get the saw running, the fuel that was in the chainsaw tank was discarded and a different fuel bottle was used.  We were unable to get the chainsaw running that day, the next morning the chainsaw started normally and was ran for a minute or so.  The elevation of the fire was 7000 feet and it was about 90 degrees when the above mentioned occurred.","I was able to contact the smokejumper base in Boise the next morning on the phone.  The main individual responsible for mixing the saw fuel for our sawpacks was there, I described the incident to him.  It was decided to send the questionable fuel bottles back to Boise to be analyzed.  Due to logistical needs, the fuel was sent back on 7/11/15.  The chainsaw was serviced in Richfield, UT after demobing the incident.  It was determined that the chainsaw functioned properly and was put back into service.

When the engine shut down I lost all control from braking and power steering! I was currently sitting right in the ingress and egress route to the fire, which in turn trapped folks there next to the fire and I was incapable of moving the apparatus. This could of burned it up, but more importantly put three lives in danger with a dead engine sitting in the road, with extreme fire activity around us.  The truck was towed off of the fire, and into Frontier Equipment & Rental in Mt. Vernon Oregon.  It was determined that Sensor 1 and 3 had become faulty on the exhaust system.  Those sensors were replaced and the truck returned to service.<br/><br/>Second Incident: 2015, June 28th	<br/>	Narrative:	While delivering a crewmember to E-415 to the Sugarloaf Fire (Incident 268).  I was driving up Dick Creek road following a driver from the incident.  At the top of Dick Creek road as I turned the engine around on an adjoining two track the engine warning light came on and the 'Stop Engine Safely Now' warning appeared on the gauge panel.  The truck immediately shut off and would not start.  This incident left the truck blocking a major access road on an active fire line during a burn out operation.<br/>	The engine would not start for over 90 minutes and could not be moved.  After 90 minutes the engine started but the check engine light remained on.  I successfully drove the engine down off the fire line and back to the Dayville Guard station with no further incident.  <br/>	We scheduled the engine to go in for service at Frontier Equipment & Rental in Mt. Vernon Oregon.  The service personnel hooked up the truck to their ECM reader and found sensor failures in the exhaust system.  Sensor 1, 3 and 4 were all reading incorrectly and showed codes for replacement. <br/>	The service personnel advised that we could reset the engine check light and bypass the faulty sensors until the replacement parts came in.  We reset the codes and drove the engine 27 miles back to the station without incident. <br/>Third Incident: 2015, June 29th 		<br/>	Narrative: 	While responding to the Initial Attack on the Schoolhouse Fire (Incident 296) Engine 613 again shut down with little warning.  While driving up a steep two track road the warning 'Stop Engine Safely Now' appeared.  Before I could maneuver the vehicle off of the road or even get to a safe area to stop, the engine shut off.  This left Engine 613 with no brakes, no power steering, and no way to shift into park.  Due to the steep slope I could not stop the truck and as I tried to shift the gear selector into park or neutral to restart the truck E-613 began to role backwards slowly with me unable to stop it.  I tried to gain control of the truck as it crept backward and off of the road toward the high side.  I was finally able to stop the vehicle but only after the back end ran up the slope and nearly tipped the truck onto the driver’s side.  <br/> <br/>On 7/2/15 E-613 had all four exhaust sensors replaced at Frontier Equipment in Mt. Vernon Oregon.  All codes were cleared and no malfunctions were detected.  The truck was returned to service that afternoon.<br/><br/>Fourth Incident: 2015, July 6th 	<br/>	Narrative:	While on patrol on forest road 12 at or about 27 miles from the Dayville Guard Station E613 once again flashed (Stop Engine Safely Now) on the dash information screen.  The truck shut down again facing uphill.  I was able to stop the truck and role it to the edge of the road, leaving just enough room for small trucks to pass, but blocking any heavy equipment passage.  The 12 road is an active access for the Corner Creek Fire (Incident 298).  We were also not able to use the mobile truck radio to contact dispatch as the voltage draw is too high to use without the truck running.  This left radio communication with dispatch strained as we were blocked from both Aldrich and Wolf Mt. repeaters.  <br/>	The truck started after 50 minutes and we drove back to the Dayville Guard Station without incident.  It was determined to take the truck immediately to a certified Ford Dealership for diagnostics.  Wright Ford of Redmond was chosen to do the work.<br/>	The recommendation from the head diagnostics and service manager was simply that this truck and all the trucks with this exhaust/sensor/computer package.  He stated that even with a patch from Ford Manufacturing the truck would still fail in this same way although the patch will allow for a few more minutes to stop the truck, but that the system “from Ford” will still shut the truck down automatically.  The Diagnostics showed all sensors working properly and no other malfunctions in the vehicles sensors.  Wright Ford will be rewriting the main computer to try to alleviate the problem using codes from Ford Manufacturing Engineers.  The engineer also stated that this was not going to be a reasonable style of emergency vehicle for working in hazardous work.  The systems from Ford, GMC, and Dodge, will act in the same way as per EPA standards.  This is unacceptable for personnel already risking their lives performing hazardous tasks, or even for driving on or near highway speeds.<br/><br/>Hazards Associated with Engine Shutdown:<br/>1.

According to the Ford Service Representative there is no way to 'legally' prevent this issue from recurring.  There is no authorized fix from Ford Engineering.  The Environmental Protection Agency will not allow modification to the Exhaust system even though it would prevent the engine from over heating and shutting down.  Bypassing this system would eliminate the need for the four sensors in the exhaust that are so prone to failure.  Though a fix does exist, without a waiver from the EPA or without being allowed to pursue other options for equipment or apparatus such as Oshkosh or other military vendors that are not required to produce vehicles held to the EPA standard, there is little hope to remedy this issue.  <br/><br/>Even Highway driving becomes an extreme hazard when loss of steering and braking are imminent in such a short time.","07/13/2015 07:26"

Personnel in the field are able to transmit to dispatch, but dispatch is unable to contact personnel in the field.  On incident 15159 we could see Aldrich repeater, but were unable to use it for communications.  Luckily if you stood in the correct place, you could reach dispatch on Dixie repeater to maintain communications.  This communication opportunity from this location is an exception to the rule, usually Aldrich is the only repeater to serve much of this area.  Incident 15152 is currently in the same area as 15159, and is fortunate to be able to use Dixie repeater.  Dixie Repeater is about 35 air miles from the incident.  The solution to this issue is to fix Aldrich repeater.<br/><br/>Second, the Group 3 selectable radio program is not user friendly, or intuitive.  When changing tones to talk on repeater, all tones on all channels in the group are changed.  This causes the Incident Commander and units using the repeater to have issues hearing each other on the tactical channels.  The worry is someone will rely on a Lookout, Incident Commander, Aircraft, or other resources and be unable to copy a transmission because someone unknowingly changed a tone to talk on a tactical channel, or repeater.  This has been an issue on incident 15095, 15119, and 15149.  Two things need to be changed.  The personnel expected to use the tone selectable group need training on how to use the group.  The selectable tones need to only change the tone on the channel being used, not every channel in the group. (or tac channels need to hear all transmission on that frequency, not just the selected tone)  <br/><br/>Third, the engines and handhelds have different radio programs.  I do not know what the differences in the programs are, and so I do not know what my channels in my radio are in the engine.  This has not been an issue yet, but it needs to be addressed before we lose communications on an incident because of improper programming.<br/><br/>Fourth, we have been having issues with the repeater system since last year.  These issues are usually related to dispatch not transmitting the first several seconds of a radio transmission.  As I am writing this today the repeaters seem to be working properly, but Dixie repeater was cutting off transmission to incident 15095 and 15119.  The dates for these incidents are 6/21/15 and 6/29-29/15 respectively.  Once again this is an issue with the transmission from dispatch, not transmissions to dispatch from the field.","The radio problems are getting progressively worse since last year, and have not improved.  The following are actions I have taken to improve the issues.<br/><br/>Aldrich repeater has to be fixed.  I have asked many times over the last year and it has not been fixed.(since the South Fork Fire in 2014) <br/><br/>The issues with the radio group 3 tone selectable issues have been addressed with my supervisors this week.  I suggested using a another group, until we have training and/or the programming is changed to make the radio group work properly.  I am personally using another group that I know works.<br/><br/>We need to have all fire related vehicles and handhelds reprogrammed to the same program.  The day I tried to get my mobile programmed the radio tech was unavailable, and didn't have enough time to program the vehicle.<br/><br/>The issue with dispatch being cut off by the repeaters has been an issue since last year. (beginning 2014)  I was told this would be fixed this winter and spring, but it has not.  I have asked my supervisors about getting this fixed multiple times, and although they have followed through with asking to get it fixed it has not improved.<br/><br/>The safety issue is this: We have an inability to rely upon the radio system to work properly.  We have to have good communications with everyone, or someone on an incident will miss an important message and get hurt. We work in an extremely dangerous environment that rapidly changes and proper communication is a Fire Order (#7), Watchout Situation (#7), and a core value of LCES.","07/13/2015 07:27"

We are in possession of the new handheld BK KNG-P150 radios since Aug. 2014. We spent time on the Lake Fire on several different very active divisions, with heavy radio traffic over nearly every relative channel. For inter-crew use we use the nationally approved Travel channel. Often, this channel is also being used by type 2 crews from out of area and the radio traffic can get heavy. <br/>Several times over the course of the 10 days were were on this fire, the three of us noticed that if there was heavy radio traffic and one member initiated a call over the crew channel, the person on the receiving end would not have a break in radio scanning to pick up the call from the sending crew member. In order to receive a call, one would have to completely turn off all scanning of other channels in order for the call to break through. We even experimented standing face to face with one another with scan both off and on. Even while facing each other and initiating a call while scanning other traffic the receiving radio would not pick up the call. We were each scanning the usual channels: Crew, Tac, A/G1, A/G2, Command. <br/>This lead to situations where there was high levels of activity on our division requiring quick and effective communications via radio and because of this the three of us could not get very far from one another, making the radios almost moot. When we did split up, only one of us could monitor outside traffic and one would have to monitor solely the crew channel. We even entered a rx and tx tone guard on our crew channel and that did not seem to solve the scanning issue.","Remained together instead of splitting up. Checked comms often with one another.

There were up to 54 crews at it's highest point and over 2,000 people. The IHC crews are provided with 3 different options for crew channels, plus a travel channel, as well as their own tone guard that they only share with one other IHC in the nation. <br/>Type II crews and other resources are not provided these channels or options. <br/>It is understood that using channels not listed in the IAP and not provided in an official capacity can be dangerous for local dispatches and law enforcement. However, the current amount of crews that are placed in the same vicinity on fires, esp. in South Ops, makes it impossible to function within those parameters. <br/>On this incident the Comms Section Chief reminded the resources that they were not allowed to use any unauthorized frequencies not listed in the IAP. We encountered that many resources, including my module, were using the national Travel channel as their crew frequency because they did not have access to another frequency. Many, I'm sure, used various frequencies pirated from the assigned frequs for their respective home units, which can and do overlap one another. <br/>If all of these resources had done as asked and discontinued their use of these 'unauthorized' frequencies and switched over to using Tac as their primary means of intra-crew communication, it would have been impossible and dangerous to use Tac for what it is intended for. It is intended as a Tactical line of communication between the Division Supervisor and his respective resources, not as a crew channel. <br/>It is unrealistic and dangerous to continue to expect and ask Type II crews to use overlapping and unauthorized sources of communication. <br/>It is understood that we, as a country and agency, are only designated a certain bandwidth, available amount of radio space, etc., but there need to be 'authorized' choices for these crews, so that they can continue to function effectively and safely on the fireline.","My module picked one of the standard tone guards for rx and tx and that cut down on some of the chatter, but we were still using an 'unauthorized' frequency and tone guard because we had no other choice.","07/13/2015 07:27"

Around 1145 the Initial Attack Dispatcher noticed the Signal Peak Base Repeater was non-operational.  The Assistant Center Manager relayed the information to the communication technician of the issue.  Within thirty minutes the Center Manager decided to send notifications to the field going resources of the current issue via text message in our CAD system. <br/>Potential concern was ongoing incidents within the zone response including ground and aviation resources in which were actively and deployed at the time.  The signal peak base is utilized by this dispatch center as the main contact station for ground resources and local flight following.  All troubleshooting and issues are being fixed during operational hours when communications are at its highest.<br/>Through the span of the day both the Signal Peak base and Copperas base were non-operational.  The initial attack dispatchers could hear resources but were unable to call back out.  Having both of these base stations down severely effects all communication into the dispatch center.  During this period of time, the dispatch center became aware of an admin employee needing assistance in the field.  Dispatch was unable to communicate with the individual because this radio system was operating at a level that was insufficient.  <br/>It is important to note that Copperas Mtn Base station has been down for close to one month.  According to the communications tech, this is a problem with the telephone company infrastructure.  <br/>At about 1600 the south zone initial attack dispatcher notified the Assistant Center Manager that the San Francisco Base was non-operational.  This effects communications into dispatch on the North end of the Gila National Forest.  The information was relayed to the communication tech in which was able to have all base stations back operational by 1700.<br/>This occurrence seems to be related to personnel at a remote location making radio system changes.   <br/>Radio problems such as this have been a common occurrence for the Dispatch Center in the last few years, especially during high levels of fire activity.  When dispatch has the highest probability of supporting ground and aviation resources engaged in fire suppression and general admin traffic, the radio system fails for some period of time.   The dispatch center will do a better job of reporting these temporary outages. <br/>As of this morning, this problem is still occurring with Signal Peak.  (21  hours)  Radio traffic during night time hours is usually minimal with a lot of regular radio traffic usually taking place in the morning hours of dispatch operations.  Radio techs are starting to work on this problem again this morning.","Immediate action was taken by the Initial attack dispatcher in notifying the Center Manager and Assistant Center Manager.  Notification was passed on the higher management locally  In which the Local Communication Technician was notified and was working on the issue with NICS.  NICS is the radio system contractor responsible for accessing into the radio system remotely.<br/><br/>Actions to mitigate required utilizing Black Range Base Station on Gila South and utilizing the different repeaters associated with that base station.  This highly limits dispatch ability to access remote radio repeaters.   The forest Lookouts were utilized as relays in which the initial attack dispatcher was able to communicate through various repeaters.  Other mitigating steps involved notifying the District offices and instructed them to follow the local workforce.  Notifications were made via e-mail and telephone calls.","06/16/2015 07:35"

After completing the checks they went in service with dispatch to Oroville to have work completed on the dozer wench cable.  All driving and operations where fine as they navigated  through the canyon until the area of the Oroville dam on Highway 70 where the operator called on the radio to inform the dozer swamper that he had lost his brakes.  Dozer swamper proceeded down the highway and informed him that the grade was about to flatten and there were some small hills where he could down shift to slow the semi.  Fortunately he was able to bring the semi to a stop just short of the highway 70/ highway 191 intersection.<br/>	Once the semi was stopped, Dozer Swamper called the Division and  dispatch via cell phone to inform them of the situation. Dozer Swamper then called our fleet manager.  Fleet manager said he would get a mechanic to come out to our location to inspect the truck and trailer.  While Dozer operator and Dozer swamper waited for the Mechanic 1 to arrive they brainstormed on what the problem could be.  Dozer operator had stated that he would hit the brakes but the trailer brakes would not work, brakes on the tractor seemed to be working properly. They completed some more brake checks to see if we could identify the problem but they were unsuccessful.  <br/>	Once the mechanic 1 arrived he looked at the trailer brakes and had the dozer operator apply and release pressure to the breaks to see if he could identify the problem.  He stated that sometimes the S cams get gummed up with dirt and will stick causing the trailer brakes to stay applied, heating up the brake drums and pads ultimately causing the brakes to fail. He then said everything looks ok with the brakes and to drive the loaded truck and trailer to the district office so he could further inspect the trailer brakes. <br/>	At the district office the mechanic pulled one tire and brake drum off the trailer.  Fleet Manager arrived and asked the Mechanic what we had going on. The mechanic stated that he believed that the S cams were sticking and the brakes got too hot to work properly. Dozer operator and Dozer Swampier stated that we were not mechanics but the brake did not feel or look to be hot or cracked in anyway and that they in fact believe that no air pressure was being applied to the brakes causing the exact opposite. The mechanic then looked at the brakes with the Fleet manager and the both agreed that the brakes did actually look fine. Dozer operator and Dozer Swamper then expressed their concern with air pressure possibly not making it to the brake pods to apply the brakes. Mechanic 1 said the system is simple and the problem had to be with the brakes themselves. Fleet manager then made the decision that all the brake components were to be replaced.  Again Dozer operator and Dozer Swamper expressed their concern about replacing the brake components not actually fixing the problem. Fleet Manager then told them to drive the truck and trailer unloaded to a shop in Paradise, CA.

Mechanic 1 also stated that it had been a long time since he had worked on combination vehicle air brake systems.<br/>  Dozer Swamper called Mechanic 2 and explained the situation to Mechanic 2 and included that Dozer operator and Dozer Swamper did not believe the trailer brakes were actually getting applied pressure when the brakes were engaged. Mechanic 2 said that he had seen this before and that it could potentially be a few different things. Dozer Swamper told Mechanic 2 the plan of action that Fleet manager and Mechanic 1 had come up with. Mechanic 2 was very concerned with our safety and what was happening with the trailer.  He said the brake components to be replaced had just been replaced a couple years ago and should still be in good working order. Mechanic 2 also said be very careful driving the truck and that he would be happy to look at it for us once we made it back.","As soon as they got to the district they immediately went to Mechanic 2 shop, looked at the old parts taken off of the trailer.  Mechanic 2 looked at the S cams and brake drums and said they all looked completely fine and he would in fact put them on his own truck. They returned back to the District office still skeptical of the reliability of the trailer brakes.<br/>	Every day since the trailer brake failure Dozer Operator and Dozer Swamper took extra time to double and even triple check the brakes on the semi during our morning PM checks.","06/16/2015 07:36"

The lightning event occurred from approximately 1800 to midnight. There was numerous down strikes and moderate rain. Park fire staff checked the DOI WFMI lightning system for strike locations, but found none. Our concerns are twofold: 1) the lightning detection system isn’t working properly 2) A recent software change makes the system not user friendly and has no “help information”. After the software changed the system is no longer intuitive and difficult to navigate.<br/><br/>Early this spring, we discovered a likely lightning caused fire, yet there was no recorded lightning for the previous three months. It’s highly unlikely there was no lightning for the previous three months.<br/><br/>We are concerned with the apparent lack of functionality due to our extreme drought. Early detection of wildfires and rapid initial attack are going to be key parts of our risk management program this year. Smaller fires pose a lower risk to the public and firefighting resources. Our management unit is largely a remote wilderness area and we depend upon the DOI lightning detection system to help us find fires and deploy resource. We understand there can be cloud-to-cloud lightning, but we feel that’s unlikely for the May 23rd lightning event.<br/><br/>A potential mitigation we are considering is to increase our aerial detection reconnaissance flights. This would increase cost and risk. <br/><br/>At a minimum the software interface needs a “help system” or some other description on how to use the program.","We contacted the NIFC help desk. The help desk was responsive almost immediately. However, we couldn’t find any data for May 23rd. The new user interface remains frustrating and uncertain.

During Initial Attack I was able to contact Miles City Dispatch with the BLM Tripoint Repeater, which is the only BLM repeater assigned to the Camp Crook, SD location for fire suppression.  This initial contact took place the first day of the fire near the origin of the fire which was on the west side of the Slim Buttes land unit.  The Tripoint repeater is located in the Long Pines land unit north and west of Camp Crook, SD approximately 47 miles (line of sight distance) away from the Moonshine fire.  The BLM does have MOUs in place to utilize the three Forest Service repeaters on the Sioux Ranger District.  The closest repeater to the Moonshine fire, which is a Forest Service Repeater (FS Slim Buttes), was located in the burn area of the Moonshine fire; however it is too far away from Miles City, MT for the signal to reach. Once the fire spread over the western ridge of the Slim Buttes land unit, and onto the eastern aspect of the Slim Buttes we lost radio communication to dispatch.   We have known this repeater site in the Slim Buttes would not reach Miles City Dispatch since it was originally constructed in the early 2000's.  There were over 200 firefighter on the Moonshine fire with little to no communication to dispatch.  If there had been an emergency of any kind firefighters on the fire would have had a very difficult time contacting any one for help.","We initially ordered a radio technician to try to set up a portable repeater link that would help us reach BLM Tripoint.  Unfortunately, all attempts failed.<br/><br/>We were forced to use cell phones anytime we needed to contact dispatch.  Even on the west side of the Slim Buttes the radio repeater BLM Tripoint, which was working at the beginning of the fire became too unreadable to use.  The limited amount of aircraft that was utilized on the fire had to flight follow through Great Plains Dispatch in Rapid City, SD due to lack of communication.   <br/><br/>We moved ICP from Reva, SD which was approximately 8 miles from the fire to Buffalo, SD approximately 20 miles from the Moonshine fire due to the fact there was no cell phone service or radio repeater coverage on the East side of the Slim Buttes.","05/20/2015 13:59"

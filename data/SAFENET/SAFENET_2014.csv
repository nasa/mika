CIO Radio Com Unit for the Southeast R8 is will aware of the problem and have been working on this site (George Washington & Jefferson NF) for 7+ months for the entire radio system.  This radio system has many issues which have been identified during this identification process, it was discovered that the consoles, which is ModUCom, was failing.  We have lost one console approximately 2 months ago and the radio tech was able to temporarily recover that unit, however currently this unit has to be reset & rebooted numerous times through out the day. The second console has just completely failed and there is no recovering this unit, it's finished and unable to be repaired, the hard drive has crashed.  If our second unit crashes we are without radio communications with the field.  Currently we have one of our four zones staffing for preparedness today and multiple personnel out in the field.","Notified Radio Tech of failed unit, we were informed that this unit was more then likely unrecoverable.  Also told that the new consoles that was purchased to replace the failing units would not be coming to us now and have been delayed at the minimum of 1 month but more then likely longer.  The new hard drives are being held up at a higher location of the FS CIO.  Currently we are trying to keep the console that is working from crashing.  If it does crash we will have to revert to secondary communications with cell phones and/or radio relays between units and offices then relayed to dispatch for documentation purposes.  This may be extra work but can be done if needed, however this will take the Coordination Center & the entire George Washington & Jefferson NF away from the centralized dispatch concept.","12/19/2014 07:42"

They immediately experienced a burning sensation and ran to the sink to rinse off the liquid.  After minor first aid was administered, another employee went to see what was in the recycling bin and found multiple bottles of diluted sulfuric acid. <br/> <br/>After contacting the distributor of the acid and speaking with the Forest Hydrologists it was determined that bottles were water sample bottles used to test the waters near fire retardant drops, and that the diluted acid acts as a stabilizer until the sample can be tested.  The sample bottles had been sent the district to test waters during the active fire season.  The extra bottles had been sent in case more retardant was used.<br/>   <br/>After talking with individuals around the district it was determined that with the hectic fire season, and the flow of people assigned to the office to assist and support fire activity, the bottles had been separated from the chain of custody letter, and the unused bottles had not been returned to the distributor at the end of fire season.  It was further determined that someone in the office was attempting to be helpful, and seeing a box of what appeared to be “empty” (the bottles contained 2 mils of sulfuric acid, and 8 mils of water) decided to recycle the bottles despite being clearly labeled with “Caution Contains Diluted Acid”.","1.	 Obviously the “Keep Green” message has been effective on the Forest.  Now we need to spread the message of what is recyclable and what is not.  Containers containing what may be a hazardous chemical should not be recycled but disposed of properly.  If there is any question whether the material is hazardous, the Forest or District Hazardous Materials coordinator should be contacted to make the determination.<br/>  <br/>2.	There will be more discussion with those assisting with fire suppression, rehab, burned area emergency rehab, resource advisors, etc. about keeping custody of items or chemicals assigned to them during their mission.  Also that chain of custody letters need to be stored with the items assigned, and those items need to be secured away from others working in the area.","02/09/2015 07:48"

Crews were brought in from off forest to assist with heavy equipment and saw teams.  Communication is critical to insure coordination of efforts and safety margins, as well as the ability to get medical assistance to the crews if needed.

We are the only emergency response resource located in the Feather River Canyon (California State Route 70).  All incoming resources to any incident in this area are approximately 30 - 50 minutes away.  My engine was dispatched to a traffic collision on California State Highway 70 in the Feather River Canyon at 1555 on 9/2/14.  It was dispatched as a single vehicle roll-over.  We drove west bound on highway 70 towards the incident.  At approximately 1610 the exhaust regen light began flashing and the exhaust regen audible alarm began sounding in the cab of the engine.  We had traveled approximately 8 miles.  I instructed the driver to keep driving and monitor the regen light.  30 seconds later the audible alarm began sounding again.  I then instructed the driver to pull off to the shoulder of the highway and to begin a parked exhaust regen.  I then called PNF ECC and advised them that I was cancelling our response due to vehicle mechanical issues (mandatory parked regen).  The parked exhaust regen took approximately 40 minutes.  By this time the traffic collision had been resolved and we returned to quarters.<br/>When I returned to quarters I called Silver State International in Sparks, NV.  They informed me that there is a recall for emergency vehicles.  This recall is a computer reprogramming that can be completed in a few minutes.  It enables the operator to continue to drive the engine even when the dash lights and audible alarm are telling the operator to pull over and complete a mandatory parked exhaust regen.  The engine will not go into 'limp mode' or even worse, completely shut down.  (Current computer programming is as follows: When the mandatory parked exhaust regen light and the audible alarm come on in the cab, the operator has approximately 3 minutes to pull off and start a parked regen.  If the operator fails to do so, the engine will go into 'limp mode' and then completely shut down and will have to be towed to an International shop). I scheduled an appointment the next day for the emergency vehicle reprogramming.  <br/>The next day I arrived at Silver State International where they plugged their computer into the engine to reprogram the electronic control module (ECM).  The mechanic 'played' with the computer for a while, and then informed me that our fire engine was too new of a model for the recall.  He could not perform the ECM reprogram.  He also informed me that this may be due to NAVISTAR not entering our specific vehicle data into the system yet.  He could not give me any definite reason to why this specific vehicle could not be reprogrammed at this time. I was told to try back at a later date.  I then called NAVISTAR directly and the 'Service Representative' that answered the phone had no idea how to handle my problem.  She informed me that she would push it up to the next level and that I would be receiving a phone call from them by close of business the next day.  This call never came.  <br/>This exhaust regen system is a mojor issue.  It is a life safety issue that needs to be resolved immediately.  Not only is it an issue while responding to incidents, it is a major hazard while engaged in firefighting activities.  This poor design could very easily lead to injury and/or death on a wildland incident.  My recommendation is to make all emergency vehicles exempt from this system.  For the vehicles that are currently in service and equipped with this exhaust regen system, the recall that allows the ECM to be reprogrammed needs to be made READILY AVAILABLE to all of these engines.  The Forest Service is taking a HUGE RISK by having this type of system on an emergency vehicle.","No further action has been taken other than what i have explained above.  This is due to any resolution to this issue being unavailable at this time.","09/16/2014 09:10"

The victim was medivac'ed  to a hospital and then to a burn center.  Agency initial attack personnel responded via helicopter but were unable to locate the incident due to time of day (near pumpkin time)and weather concerns.  <br/><br/>08/24/2014 Initial attack firefighters responded via helicopter along with two fire investigators.  Upon arrival at the closest helispot, they were approached by a second river guide company requesting medical assistance for a 15 year old male with partial thickness burns to his feet.  The victim was medivac'ed to a hospital and then to a burn center.  Investigators and firefighters discovered the Mesa Fire.  The Mesa Fire was a pile of wood which had accumulated in a canyon due to flash flooding  over several years.  Size of the original pile was approximately 45' long, 45' wide, and 20' high.  At some point in the previous week, the pile had been ignited - no evidence remained of cause of ignition.  The entire pile had consumed and condensed to an ash pit with almost no combustible material remaining.  The pile was located immediately adjacent to a heavily used trail.  The fire investigator was walking adjacent to the trail when he fell through a thin crust and into the ash pit.  The ash pit contained extremely hot coals to a depth of 4 feet.  The investigator's nomex pants pulled up and he received a partial thickness burn to his lower leg.  The investigator was treated by on-scene medical personnel, transported to a clinic, treated, and released back to full duty.  The area was flagged off and mopped up with pumps and hand tools.<br/><br/>08/25/2014  Firefighters returned to the Mesa Fire and continued mopup for a full shift leaving the incident in contained status and leaving the site flagged off to the public.","All incident personnel were wearing all appropriate PPE (Leather boots, nomex pants, nomex shirts, hard hats, leather gloves.  Discussed the need to secure pant legs with the attached velcro/drawstrings to prevent pants from 'riding up' when falling into an ash pit.  Discussed ensuring scene safety and not assuming the ground is completely solid and safe after an intense fire has occurred.  <br/><br/>Ash pit hazards are more common in forested areas which contain deep duff layers.  They are not as common, but not unknown, in areas such as this canyon.  The volume of material which had consumed over the previous several days resulted in an ash pit up to 4 feet deep which was not anticipated.

As the bus crossed over the highest point of elevation on the road, the steep ascent required the bus operator to shift into 2nd gear and begin to apply the air driven brakes to keep the vehicles speed in line appropriately with conditions.  As the bus continued to descend, the bus operator increased the frequency of air driven brake operation and attempted to shift into 1st gear however was unable to engage the transmission to 1st gear.  Shortly thereafter the bus' low air alarm audible and visual warnings engaged and the bus operator experienced a brake pedal that lost pressure.  The bus began to increase speed and the operator immediately directed the bus into the opposite lane and into the shoulder along a steep mountain face with sand tailings.  The bus came to a stop and the operator allowed the Crew Boss to place two rubber wheel chocks in front of the bus' front wheel. The opposite lane's shoulder was nearly non-existent without guard rails and descending in a steep drop-off. The Crew Boss then noticed smoke coming from the right side rear dual wheel wells.  The occupants were directed to stay on the bus due to the proximity of a sharp corner approximately 50' from the final resting point of the bus and the bus' placement on the shoulder in the oncoming traffic lane.  The incident Safety Officer was also descending along the road and stopped to provide assistance to the operator and crew.  The Safety Officer advised Command of the incident and assisted with providing emergency warning to passing vehicles of the disabled bus.  An additional contract bus was requested by the Safety Officer to assist with relocating the crew to ICP.  All occupants including the driver were evacuated from the bus and walked across the traffic lanes to the opposite shoulder.  The emergency warning lights were enabled on the disabled bus.  The Safety Officer did an initial interview with the bus operator on scene and transported the operator back to ICP.  The crew returned to ICP via the requested second contract bus at approximately 2130. <br/>The following morning, at approximately 1000 hours, August 19, 2014, the Safety Officer met with the Crew Boss and requested a verbal statement that was recorded on a smartphone on the details leading up to and following the issue.<br/>The contract bus was towed from the scene and incident mechanics as well as the bus contractor's own mechanics inspected and diagnosed the affected bus concluding in the bus' removal from service due to brake failure.","The reporting Crew Boss immediately assisted the contract bus driver in bringing the bus to a safe stop.

This happened within a 4 minute timeline and a 1 mile span of road. There was no safe area to immediately park the vehicle once it started losing power and it was parked at the closest available turnout. The vehicle was on a busy 2 lane highway (Highway 96). Stopping on the road would have caused a much greater hazard. We had to drive the vehicle under a severe loss of power and then once parked it would not move.<br/>We were on our way to an assignment on a narrow one way road with limited turnouts. It had the potential to compromise the safety of the crewmembers and other surrounding resources if this failure would have happened on the line. The rest of the crew had to modify its assignment because the entire crew was needed for the planned actions.  <br/>The vehicle was towed and fixed. The shop fixed the 'Regen' problem by force “Regening” and also replaced a fuel injector. It was picked up in 2 days.<br/>While driving back to home unit on August 16, 2014 'A-Mod' lost all power while driving on a busy street. The crew carrier immediately became un-drivable and blocked a busy intersection. We had to pull the crew carrier into a parking lot with the Supt truck. The mechanic that showed up said that it was a “Regen” problem not fixable in the field. It was towed into a mechanic shop. Mechanic stated that it was a 'Regen' problem and that they had to replace the fuel pump. 'A-Mod' is still in the shops.<br/><br/>When we first got the crew carriers in March 2014 this happened to our 'B-Mod'. 'B-Mod' lost all power on the freeway while driving back in March.   <br/>Both Mods have frequently been in and out the mechanics shop for this issue.                                                                          <br/>Crew Carriers are supposed to go through 3 levels of warnings before they go into a loss of power mode; they are going into emergency shutdown mode without prior warning or alarms. the problem is getting worse.","Driver notified the supervisors of mechanical breakdown immediately and then it was immediately reported to the Division Supervisor, Safety Officer, and Ground Support.<br/><br/>The Vehicle was parked in a safe area 1 mile away from the fireline.<br/>Crew remained in the vehicle until Ground Support arrived with alternate transportation for the crewmembers; this was 4 hours after the initial breakdown.<br/>The Safety Officer on the incident was notified and consulted for safety concerns. <br/><br/>When the crew carrier broke down the 2nd time on a busy street it had to be pulled by the Superintendent truck's winch in order to get the truck to safety and prevent further traffic hazards. Forest FMI, GACC, and Supervisors were notified.<br/><br/>We are now taking into consideration that we have undependable crew transport vehicles. We will reconsider accepting any assignments that require the crew carriers to be on narrow roads.

After an aerial recon. it was determined to do additional burning using a PSD dispenser out of a helicopter.  Line Operations contacted Division P and the firing boss in the helicopter to discuss the planned operations.  After the initial strips were ignited, it was determined that it would be beneficial to light additional strips near the Div A/P break.  Div P was fully aware of this and attempted to contact Div A.  Div A was scouting another section of his Division and did not hear the radio transmission.  Although the resources on Div A observed the helicopter flying in close proximity to them, they did not realize a firing operation was about to occur.  In addition, one of the engine crews was concerned that their position would have been compromised had the firing operation produced more active fire behavior.  The safety issue is the breakdown in communication that2 occurred.","An AAR was held the morning of August 11th, with all the resources on the line and the overhead involved in the burnout operation, to discuss this communication breakdown. Several items were identified on how to improve on this situation: 1. On days that firing operations are planned, they should be discussed during the morning meeting.  2. All resources on the line should be gathered together and briefed, in person, prior to firing operations including adjoining resources.   3. Divisions and crew bosses should empower all line resources, including inexperienced firefighters to speak out if something doesn't look right.  4.

Previous to that, there were 3 ICP's running 3 separate command repeater systems.  Our system, called Omak communications at the east side, was never engineered to cover the Winthrop area, yet they decided to try it anyway.  By this time, COML was located in Winthrop.  Problems occurred with Carlton being able to hear the east side system, yet they took over communications anyway.  This was an unreliable communications configuration, and easily could have led to emergency communications not heard by Carlton Comm.  At one point in the evening, they could not hear units from the east side.  By then, we only had 2 RADOs in the east at the Okanagan Fairgronds, who had already worked all day, and we did not have any night dispatchers assigned.  We advised them, and told them that the only choice was to send one of their night dispatchers over, or pull all the crews off the line.  It took several hours, but they sent a dispatcher over for that night.  In the morning briefing, we announced to the day crews that there were problems with Carlton Comm hearing us, so we said that all communications will go thru Omak Communications.  Then, just 2 hours later, Carlton advised us that they are taking back the dispatching.  This was very inappropriate as the day crews were told to go thru Omak, and now there was confusion.  This change should have occurred at the next operational period, not in the middle of one.  Other things that occurred were that Carlton called us 5 minutes before the next morning briefing, and said they are sending us a new clone and we were to re-clone all the day crews.  This was too late to accomplish safely as we should never rush re-cloning in order to prevent errors.  Additionally, we noticed at the evening briefing, that the COML in Carlton changed the names of the tacs listed on the 205, without advising us, and also changed one of the other frequencies.  We were not notified of this nor did they probide us with a new clone.  Crews went out to the field with (as an example) Tac 1 listed in their radio channel 1, but the 205 said Tac 4.  This also created quite a bit of confusion out on the line.  Our Safety Officer on the east side was not pleased.  The bottom line is that there was poor, and sometimes no communication between the COML and Winthrop Communications, with the east side communication personnel, and changes were made in the middle of operational periods.  This is unacceptable and training on this should occur to the Rocky Mountain Team.  Fortunately, no injuries or major incidents occurred as a result, but this should be corrected to prevent potentially future problems.","1.  We continued to monitor the east side communications system thruout the day, and we monitored a radio at night while we tried to sleep.<br/>2.  Our Safety Officer had a plan in place where if the night ops could not reach Carlton, to immediately notify him and he in turn would wake us up to staff our dispatch.<br/>3.

During direct line construction, burn out and holding operations the ability to have safe and effective intra crew communications, especially with the lookouts was extremely problematic especially during the peak burning period.<br/>* Note the crew did try using all four allotted frequencies with our dedicated tone (Rx & Tx) and had the squelch in the indent position.<br/><br/>Below is a short explanation of the specific problems we dealt with while on this incident. There were 12 to 16 IHC's working on the fire during these shifts.  All of the crews are using the same dedicated frequencies with their dedicated tones.<br/><br/>Lookouts: During the duration of the assignment our Lookouts were posted on high mountain ridges and their communications and ability to transmit were extremely difficult. (Constant busy signals and garbled transmissions). Their communications were disrupted throughout the entire shift as they were exposed to all of the other IHC's transmissions on the fire.<br/><br/>7/18/14 : 1730 to 1930 - (Direct Line Construction with Helicopter Bucket Support) There were continuous busy signals during this time frame when trying to coordinate water drops between crew personnel. This caused missed radio transmissions with the helicopter and crew personnel. This created confusion where water drops should be prioritized and most importantly making sure crew personnel were in a safe location during the operation.<br/><br/>7/19/14 : 1330 to 2000 - (Holding and Burnout Operations) While holding approximately 3 miles of secured fire line and burning out pockets, we consistently had broken communications and busy signals, this was a major concern for accountability of crew personnel. At this time the use of the Tactical frequency was continuously being used by adjoining resources that were working on several active spot fires on the Division, therefore Tac was not an option.<br/><br/>7/20/14 : 1730 to 2000 - (Indirect Line Prep)  While prepping a dozer line for a possible burn out operation with three other IHC's the Tactical frequency was continuously busy because of the fire behavior and approaching thunderstorms. Communication within the crew, most importantly the lookout, was hindered due to busy signals and distorted communications.<br/><br/>7/21/14 : 1430 to 1830 - (Down Hill Line Construction) Consistently the intra crew communications were hampered  during this time frame as 9 IHC' s we're working with-in a 1 1/2 mile radius.<br/><br/>In conclusion,  the crew was able to operate despite the communication issues and did not have any close calls. This frequency issue is breaking down a fundamental rule of engagement L.C.E.S. and needs to be addressed. Finally, I believe this is a hole in the swiss cheese, a big one.","-Utilized all four allotted frequencies with specific crew tone.<br/><br/>-Face to face discussions with adjoining IHC's.<br/><br/>-Monitored transmission light on the radio to identify open timeframes to send out a transmission.<br/>(Watching the radio, takes away from situational awareness)","07/30/2014 09:28"

It has been made all the more difficult by a forest manager,who has taken a heavy role in fire management on the Forest in multiple arenas. This is a long standing issue as shown in the WIF Regional Forester Review in 2012 and has continued to escalate. As stated in the review: “Many employees shared the feeling that they were not heard or respected by the [manager], especially if they had different views.” And “Employees shared experiences of being micromanaged by the [manager].” Despite recommendations on how to improve relationships with employees, these issues have persisted. WIF employees feel this SAFENET is the only recourse to highlight their concerns as one of the major findings in the report was, “There is widespread fear of adverse consequences for disagreeing with the [manager].” This comes full circle to this year’s fire season. <br/><br/>The WIF had multiple large fires this season and cycled through four Type 2 teams, one Type 1 team, and four Type 3 teams. The manager's presence weighed heavily on the firefighting effort. While there were multiple lightning caused fires being assessed and initial attacked in excess of the Deception Fire and Staley Complex and a large expanded dispatch and buying team organizations, the manager pulled a fire manager (FM) into an office for a closed door meeting. According to participants in the room, the FM was berated for almost an hour for disagreeing in a meeting with a transition from a Type 3 organization to a Type 2 organization. It was further expressed that once the FM thought about it, that they would come to realize the manager was right.  The meeting was closed by telling the FM that they needed to find a way to get behind the current leadership, and if they couldn’t find a way to do that then they may need to have a hard conversation with themself and decide if they can continue to work here or if it’s time to think about moving somewhere else.  The FM felt bullied and it caused them to be distracted to the point they felt it compromised their ability to stay focused, which impacts the safety of the on the ground firefighting resources.  The FM's employees noticed their supervisor's unsettled nature and their concern for what happened drew their attention partially away from their work of supporting resources on the ground. This meeting took place on 8/15/2014. <br/><br/>The difficult work environment of the WIF is not just a perception of its employees. Visiting resources provided their interpretation of what they witnessed and experienced this season.<br/><br/>A final point of the Regional Forester’s Review was, “Numerous employees within and outside of the fire organization feel that fire has been unfairly singled out by the [manager] for behavioral issues.” This lack of consistency in regards to the other resource areas of the WIF is not lost on the fire employees. Although, this point affects the entire organization, fire leadership and the Rangers absorb the brunt of most of the manager's actions. The manager consistently points to issues with the fire organization in regards to drugs, alcohol and sexual violence. In previous years, the Fire organization has had issues in these areas. Management has ordered safety stand downs in regards to these issues and they have been discussed by the Forest and Region. Young firefighters have expressed their concern about automatically being cast in a negative light due to working in fire. Recently, two temporary employees were terminated and/or resigned due to possession of drugs in government housing. Neither were fire employees and there has been no discussion at the forest level in regards to the situation. Despite this not being publicized, word has spread too many of the on the ground firefighting resources and again they are distracted from their work by being treated differently from other departments. This type of inconsistency is something the fire leadership of the forest cannot keep from impacting the entire organization. <br/><br/>It is understood that SAFENET should be timely. Due to the assured examples of reprisal by the manager, it has taken a great deal of courage to compile this information and submit it. The WIF is out of the worst of fire season (hopefully), but has a great deal of suppression rehab/repair ahead including chipping, fire line rehab, pulling hose, working around heavy equipment, etc. in hazardous areas. There is much work to be done heading into the Fall and there are significant concerns that with this level of distraction we were and hopefully will continue to be lucky. Lucky to have such high levels of professionalism throughout the fire organization and forest that can operate successfully despite the manager's actions, but the situation continues to escalate and we cannot keep this pace up. It is widely believed that the manager is a very talented and intelligent person, but the impact of the management style on employees dictates that intellect and talent should be used in a different position. We need help before this difficult work environment results in a serious accident or fatality.","Despite multiple members of the Regional Fire organization visiting the Deception complex and experiencing this behavior, there has been no action taken that we are aware of. That is why we are filing this SAFENET.","10/16/2014 07:46"

On arrival the Engine Captain of A assumed the role of ICT4 trainee.  Engine A was assigned Division Whiskey (fully qualified ENGB).  <br/><br/>    Instructions were given from Division Whiskey to mobile attack the right flank of the fire.  Engine B (type 4) was tasked with attacking the fire from the road to a barbed wire fence and Engine A then began a mobile attack from the other side of that fence.  After Engine B secured the section from the road to the fence they joined in tandem with Engine A in mobile attacking.  Around this point Engine C (rural type 6 engine) was assigned to follow up behind Engines A and B.  As Engine A neared the river the sage brush became thicker and taller.  Engine A, after consulting with Engine B, decided to let the fire burn a little further to the right (where sagebrush became lighter) and then to suppress it in the lighter fuels.  Engine B then took the lead and began suppression when the fire made it to the lighter sagebrush.  Engine A then reversed to re-position for suppression behind Engine B.  While in reverse the tie rod on the engine pulled up a rock into the oil pan of the engine's motor, causing the motor to loose oil.  The ENOP of A did a quick inspection of the oil pan and decided not to move the truck further because it would likely cause substantial more damage to the engine.    <br/><br/>    The ENOP notified Whiskey of hitting the rock and the truck being out of service.  Whiskey then asked if A was 'in a good place?'.  The ENOP told Whiskey that the engine was in the green but on the edge of really good black and felt safe in that location.  Engines B and C were able to quickly tie into the river nearby and worked their way back up the line to make sure it was secure.  Before the engines were able to check the line fully, Engine B was re-assigned to go across the river and attack the fire where it had jumped the river.  Engine C was left with making sure the line was secure.  The ENOP from A, after hitting the rock re-positioned himself on top of the engine to get a better view of the line behind them.  The ENOP then noticed smoke kicking up from the area around the barbed wire fence.  The ENOP then verbally asked the captain from Engine C to go check it out.  <br/><br/>    Before Engine C could get back to the fence the fire broke out near the fence and began making a push back down the line.  The Engine A ENOP then notified Division Whiskey about the breakout and asked if they could get a SEAT to drop on it and if they could get Engine B to come back.  Engine C then began to attack the break out but ran out of water.  The ENOP realized the SEAT and Engine B where not going to make it in time to help them out.  The ENOP ordered the crew to pull engine protection lines and to begin a burnout around the three sides of the engine.  While beginning the burnout around the truck, radio traffic became very busy but was able to notify ICT4 (T) and Division Whiskey that they were beginning a burnout around the truck.  ICT4 then ordered all radio traffic to switch to a different Tac channel and for Engine A to stay on the current Tac channel.  Division Whiskey was able to make it back to Engine A in time to assist with burning.  The burnout went smoothly no with no injuries or further damage.","Conducted an AAR to identify what went well and what needed improvement.  One of the items identified was to have a designated spotter while mobile attacking, as well as everyone on the crew keeping an eye out for hazards.

Upon arrival we were briefed by the Incident Commander.  We received an adequate initial briefing on the fire situation, our work assignment and also the duties of the other resources on the fire. We were to begin working from the south end and work toward the other engine crew on the north.  Awhile later I was told I would be available for any Initial Attack and be ready to respond.  I then went to recharge my water tank at the canal and was temporarily released to drive into town, top off on fuel, and quickly feed my crew to prepare for IA.  This was possible because the fire was mostly lined and we were in mop up stage.  After returning to the fire the hand crew arrived.  When they reached the south end of the fire they requested water support with a hose lay from the engines on the road.  I was not contacted directly from the IC.  I heard over the radio that the crew was to tie in with me (E-6361) and use our equipment to lay out hoses and fittings and to use our water.  This raised red flags with me because I was the designated IA engine.  The crew quickly approached me and said 'Apparently you're IA mission is a low priority.' I tried to contact the IC with no response as to clarify his intent with my engine so I could begin to make necessary adjustments.  I tied in with BLM E-3665 and said 'I am IA so if I have to respond while providing water support for this crew I don't want to abandon my equipment on the ground.  Let's use your equipment so you can take over water support and I can break away and recharge at the canal.  It will take us less than 10 minutes to do so from an empty tank if needed.'  E-3665 agreed to the plan.  We then used his hose lay equipment and I hooked up to it.  We were able to quickly complete the hose lay and shortly after I saw the IC walking south along the west flank toward us.  We then had a face to face and I reminded him that I was IA but was expected to lay out equipment and provide water support for the hand crew. I also told him what E-3665 and I had planned. He said 'Oh yeah, about that, there is going to be a change in the initial plan.'  My engine was now to be dedicated to the fire and E-3665 was now IA since they had local knowledge and could respond better.  If this happened the IC would also be leaving with E-3665 and turn the fire over to me.  At this point I repeated my understanding of the changes and he confirmed.  He then walked away.  About 30-40 minutes later, E-3665 drove up close to us, I asked them if they had been informed of the change of plans.  ENGB(T) said he had not been informed of any changes.  I then told him he was IA and I was to stay and IC the fire should they get the call to respond.  I also informed him that the current IC would be going with them.  I then told him to transfer any and all equipment from my engine to his that he had used on the ground so that he would be fully stocked and ready for IA. The hose lay that was laid out now became my responsibility and would stay with me from this point on. I heard over the radio the IC contacting dispatch and informing them that all fire suppression efforts were to end at 1800 and an AAR was to be conducted at 1830.  I had just returned with my third tank of water and was hooking back up to the hose lay, this was about 1730.  I called to my crew members who were hiking in to man the hose to let me know when they were ready to send them water.  At that point the duty officer in the area, in Unit 3106, asked the IC if both engines were informed on when operations were to end and when and where the AAR was to be conducted.  I assumed 3106 heard our radio traffic and saw that we were ready to begin another round of hose work/mop up. I figured he saw that we were running short on time and he was double checking with the IC.  The IC then said 'Yes, E-3665 knows and I am pretty sure I told 6361.'  He had not informed us directly face to face or by radio, I however happened to hear his communication with dispatch on the situation earlier.  At this point I was never told the plan for the end stage of the shift, so I called the IC and said, 'Did you want me to start rolling up this hose lay?' The IC said, 'No, go ahead and leave it in place we are going to use it tomorrow.' I asked 'Will 6361 be back?' He confirmed 'affirmative'.  Again I did not know the plan concerning end of shift or resource plans for the next day. (This is now E-6361's equipment to be left over night) I told my crew to work for 10 more minutes and then make their way back to the truck. I also informed them of the plan for the hose lay and that we would be returning tomorrow. When the crew got geared down and in the truck I double checked with them to see if they remembered being contacted by the IC concerning the shift end and AAR location/time.  They both said they were thinking the same thing that I was when they heard the IC's response to 3106's question about informing us.  <br/><br/>My thoughts were that the IC was a little nervous, possibly overwhelmed, flustered, and not exactly comfortable in his position. It seemed he overlooked a few things.  I did not bring up the communication/assignment issues at the AAR as to not embarrass the IC in front of all the resources assigned.  My plan was to talk to him personally, one on one, at the office and go over the issues of the day.  Upon returning to the office that evening I did not get the opportunity to do this.  Just before signing off that night I was informed that I had a morning meeting called with our duty officer from the BIA.  This meant that we would need to be briefed with the BLM duty officer alone and join up with the rest of the BLM crews at the fire later.  At the morning briefing I asked the BLM D.O. if he had any opinions of the IC's performance of the day before on the River Bottom Fire.  He returned the questioned to me and asked what my thoughts were.  After my concerns were laid out he suggested, for safety purposes and for the individual development of the IC, that I should document and possibly turn in a safenet.  <br/><br/>Areas of concern for adhering to the standard firefighting orders on the River Bottom Fire.  <br/><br/>#6 Be alert, keep calm, think clearly, act decisively<br/>-IC seemed a little flustered and scattered<br/>#7 Maintain prompt communications with your forces, etc<br/>-Plans and changes in plans were not communicated in a clear or timely manner<br/>#8 give clear instructions and be sure they are understood<br/>-a few times instructions that were thought to be clear, conflicted with instructions given to other fire resources <br/>-changes in plans did not reach the people they were intended for<br/>#9 Maintain control of your forces at all times<br/>-On the ground the control felt disconnected and reactive at best <br/><br/>Watch Out Concerns<br/><br/>#6 Instructions and assignments were not clear<br/>-Sometimes assignments were not given to the resource directly.

Another fire engine tried to respond to BMIDC but to no avail.  As the Cayuse IC, I called BMIDC on the cell phone and communicated that way for the remaining portion of the shift.<br/><br/>On June 25 the BIA had a Type 6 engine 0761 conduct a fire check on the Cayuse Incident.  Initially, 0761 communicated with BMIDC on ODF Black Mountain that they were conducting a fire check.

Difficulty arose when I was not able to transmit out to dispatch and was forced to hike back to our engine to use the mobile radio where I was successfully able to transmit to dispatch. This occurred repeatedly during the initial stages of the fire. It was not until later in the day when I used another individual's handheld radio with a whip antenna that I could transmit to dispatch from the fire site. Additionally, while using the mobile radio in the engine I did not receive certain response transmissions from dispatch and had to confirm that they had received my transmissions. Dispatch said they had received my transmissions and had responded, but admitted they were having their own radio problems.","I made use of the engine's mobile radio to communicate with dispatch until we discovered the radios with whip antennas were transmitting out. I also tried changing locations to higher and more open ground with my radio that were not effective. I informed my supervisors on the following duty day (Wednesday, June 11).","06/17/2014 08:32"

At approximately 1010 hours, one of the helitack crew members called out, “My arm, my arm is broke!”  At that time the helitack assistant called the Incident Commander and informed him of the situation and to order an ambulance. The helitack assistant also informed the IC that he would give him a more complete size up once he was done with a patient assessment. It took approximately two minutes for him to hike to the injured crewmembers position; when he reached the patient, he was in a seated position holding his right arm. The helitack crew EMT, arrived at the patients position shortly after the helitack assistant did and began his medical assessment. After contacting the IC, the assistant radioed the Badger Fire Helibase and informed them to configure for a medical transport if needed. The time was roughly 1015. At 1018, the helitack assistant decided air transport would be the best option given the location and the severity of the injury. The EMT and an engine crew member finished stabilizing the patient and then started hiking him to the medevac helispot that was established. At 1025, the assistant ordered the helibase to launch 7AW to the helispot for patient pick up. At 1027, 7AW spooled up and was in the air. Once 7AW reached the helispot the patient was loaded into 7AW with the EMT and helitack supervisor accompanying him. At 1039, 7AW launched from the medevac helispot and was en route to the hospital. 7AW arrived at John C Lincoln helipad at 1103. <br/>After a brief discussion with the injured firefighter the assistant determined that the accident was caused while the firefighter was hiking through rocks. While hiking the firefighter lightly grabbed a rock that became free and rolled onto his right upper arm.  The rock was estimated to weight 300lbs. by the firefighters on scene. The rock rolled past the firefighter and came to rest within 10 feet of its original location.  The firefighter arm was visually deformed, but there was no bleeding.

This engine was assigned to a Strike Team of engines ordered by South Ops for a preposition cover assignment to the Host National Forest for high fire danger, low RHs and a predicted Santa Ana wind event. The engine had less than 3000 miles logged when it left its home unit, and had no issues mechanically.<br/><br/>Engine traveled to the Host Forest on April 29th, and was assigned to cover a Ranger District. At 0700 on May 5th the engine module was enroute from hotel to the District Office to attend a conference call.

This process took approximately 30 seconds.  Luckily engine module had a safe place to pull off road. Engine module in conjunction with strike leaders and local personnel arranged for a mechanic to look at the truck.  Mechanic worked on truck, overriding the computer system and forcing engine to regenerate twice, about 10 minutes each time.  Mechanic appeared confused, spent most of the time on the phone with someone else; his abilities did not appear to be top notch.  At 1140 mechanic decided we needed a tow, and left.  Engine captain continued to force engine to do a parked regeneration, and eventually all alarms went off, and engine appeared to be operating normally.<br/><br/>On 5/10/14 engine had 5055 miles, and had been operating normally since last incident.  At 0845 while traveling to duty station regeneration warning lights again rapidly elevated from Level 1, to Level 2, Level 3 than shutdown warning sounded in just enough time for engine to clear a lighted intersection while making a left hand turn off the highway. Truck would not allow driver to do a parked regeneration, and had to get towed to an International dealer.<br/>Module was given a swing engine by the hosting unit.  Latter incident occurred on a Saturday, local home and regional fleet managers would not allow truck to be worked on at overtime rate, because issue may fall under the warranty.

I was briefed at the Douglas Ranger District Office about the fire and the resources on scene and the resources that were on order. I began travel to fire which was over an hour away.  While en route I was monitoring fire command, Tac, and Air to Ground. Air attack also arrived on scene and began ordering retardant. Around 16:00 I heard an ICT-4 and ICT4 trainee identified a State Resource as acting Air Ops. I arrived on scene shortly thereafter and began the discussion with the ICT4 and ICT4 trainee about turning the fire over to an ICT-3 with myself as the ICT-3 Trainee. The ICT4 and I also discussed the need for him to stay attached to the helicopter as he was the only helicopter Manager.   Based on complexity with resources on scene and resources en route the ICT4, state duty officer, myself and ICT3 were all in agreement to turn it into a Type-3 Fire. ICT3 and I then assumed command with myself as the ICT-3 trainee.<br/>Once in command I split the fire into 2 divisions Div-A and Div-G. I assigned DIV-A  and at that time he had several engines  and the helitack crew. I assigned DIV-G and he had a couple state engines. I briefed air-attack about the change and that there would be no more Air Ops and he would be working with the respective divisions. An IHC arrived on scene around 17:50 and a DOC crew arrived on Scene about the same time. I briefed both crews and assigned DOC to DIV-A and IHC to DIV-G. Around 18:00 another engine arrived and I assigned them into DIV-G. Suppression efforts were successful and we slowed then stopped the fire spread. The ICT4 and I then had a discussion about keeping the helitack crew to work into the night and I would release them in the morning after briefing to return to Douglas. The ICT4 returned with  the helicopter to Douglas and I kept the helitack crew.  <br/>After Dark I began the conversation with ICT3 about plan for that night and plan for the next shift. I decided to release most of the state resources and at the end of the shift roll the fire back to an ICT-4 fire and keep the ICT-4 trainee. The original ICT4 and I talked by phone and he agreed based on the fact that ICT4 Trainee was the initial attack ICT-4 trainee that it made sense to use him again in that role and that I could keep him as the trainee through the next shift. The ICT4 and I also talked about where they were dipping out of because we were going to have to look into ownership and possible payment or replacement of the water. My supervisor and I also talked about the need to find the water sources and what the district needs were for any new initial attack the next day.  Later that night talked the engine I’d assigned to Division G about the where the water sources were and that and that his assignment’s the next day was going to be to track down where the water sources were and determine ownership. He stated that he thought they had used those water sources before and there might be leopard frogs in them. I stated to relay everything so that the District Ranger would get info and everything was on the up and up. The Div-G engine then asked if they should fill up there engine tonight or the next morning when they went to do there assignment as they had responded to the incident from far away and were low on fuel. I told him to fill up the next morning. At the end of shift I released most of the state resources and kept 3 engines, helitack crew, the DOC and the IHC.<br/><br/>5/03/2014<br/>ICT-4 Trainee briefed at 06:00, the plan given was to have the DOC and one engine go up the left flank hold and secure. The IHC and another engine would hold and secure right flank. If there was a new Initial Attack that requested resources from our incident we would send the engine on the left flank and the IHC first. Helitack and the third engine were not mentioned in the briefing.   The third engine had an assignment that put them out of pocket from the incident on a time frame I wasn’t sure about. I had also briefed the Div-G engine on the assignment and knew that they would be in contact and the helitack crew was being released I didn’t deem it relevant that either resource be included in the briefing.  <br/><br/>Shortly after briefing ended the ENGB of the third engine (referred to hereafter as E3) asked to talk. E3 and I walked around 50 to 75 feet behind vehicles away from everybody.  E3 then accused me of accommodating the ICT4 trainee and that he was getting a different assignment than he normally would have got because I had someone else as the ICT-4 Trainee. E3 stated something along the lines that I was brushing him aside. I told E3 that they were best choice to take care of finding the tanks (water sources) assignment. E3 said that that he was the main Engine for the district and that he should be staying on the fire. I stated that I do not need my decisions questioned like this on a fire. I also stated he is one of two engines for the district and we don’t need this drama on every fire and I was releasing him from the incident. I told E3 to go finish finding the tanks and your released.  E3 asked if he is being sent back to the district for initial attack and I said yes. E3 stated that this is going to be an issue. I then contacted my supervisor and explained the situation with E3. I then contacted Dispatch by phone and notified them of the situation and that I had released E3 for safety reasons.<br/> <br/>This interaction with E3 affected my mind state and caused me undo stress the rest of the day as around 12:00 I had to respond to a new Initial Attack with the resources we had designated in the morning briefing and i was still aggravated by the discussion with E3 that occurred earlier.  This type of interaction with E3 is exactly what my supervisor and I warned our Forest Management about before the Middlemarch fire. The Middlemarch fire was of moderate rate of spread and fairly straight forward early in the fire season. My expectation is that conditions will worsen and resistance to control will increase. I also expect that these issues with E3 will continue for the foreseeable future creating a difficult and unsafe situation to manage. I do not want the onus of trying to manage E3 on wildfires put on Incident Commanders from or not from the district that E3 has known problems with. It literally puts me in the position of taking over most fires on the district to relieve the other IC’s of that responsibility. These situations with E3 have been occurring for years on and off fires. Forsest Management is well aware of the situation.","The full context of what has been going on Douglas Ranger District can be explained by Forest Management. Forest Management is aware and supportive of the fact that i will be submitting this.","05/27/2014 08:03"

Many were swollen and would have to be finagled into the launcher barrel, while others appeared to be split or otherwise damaged. This spurred an inspection of all hotshot flares carried on our module. Upon inspection, we noticed that several of the flare boxes had “born on” dates. This made us wonder, if hotshot flares are marked with a 'born on' date, then they likely have an expiration date...which could be a potential safety issue.  Therefore, we took several measures to look into this issue, mitigate and better understand this “high risk, low frequency” tool of the wildland fire trade. These actions are detailed in the “Action Taken” portion of the SafeNet.","The first step taken to mitigate the potential safety issue of expired flares was to speak with the owner of FireQuick Products. The following is a summation of the information obtained from the owner which addresses the primary safety concerns of hotshot flare and flare launcher usage. <br/><br/>Hotshot flares are advertised with a 3 year shelf life. However, proper treatment can result in an extended life. On the other hand, flares exposed to high humidity, improper storage, excessive temperatures etc. may have a shortened life. FireQuick recommends storing flares in a relatively low humidity environment, keeping flares in the package until use and storing in a reasonably temperate environment. Even if flares exceed the 3 year expiration date, they are still viable and acceptable to fire, especially if they have been properly cared for. <br/><br/>Defective flares can be identified by excessive swelling, shredded components or cap removal/shredding. Swollen flares can still be used if pushed into the barrel. However, caution should be used when doing this. If too much effort is expelled in getting the flare into the barrel and the flare is being torn up, then it should be discarded. If flares have caps that are coming off, have already come off, or are shredded, then the flare should be discarded. It is important to NOT bang on the cap because the flare is pressure sensitive. It also should be noted that hotshot flares should NEVER be ignited by hand due to the high speed of ignition. <br/><br/>If a flare is expired past viability or if there is something else wrong with it, it will result in a dud flare. A dud flare will either explode in the air before impact with the fuel or will not explode at all. It is important to exercise caution when approaching a dud flare that does not explode and to wait at least 2 minutes (if not more) before making contact with the flare in case it does indeed explode. <br/><br/>Of other note, FireQuick recommends using .22 loads with a rating of 6 (purple) or 7 (grey) for the original FireQuick Launcher 1. The newer launchers (Dual Launcher III) should NOT be used with 7 loads because it may cause damage to the cylinder. Furthermore, each flare has several slits on the sides which should not be mistaken for damage. These slits allow for ventilation of the gases when the igniter of the flare first explodes and for spinning action which allows for more energy to be given off in lighter fuels. <br/><br/>Within our unit, we took measures to mitigate the potential hazard of flares by a) inspecting all flares for damage, b) labeling older flare boxes in a place quickly and easily readable and c) exercising caution in the field when using older flares. If flares need disposal, the simplest way is to burn them off. They can also be disposed of with the following steps (according to the FireQuick User Training Workbook, which can be ordered through the FireQuick website): <br/>  1. Immerse flare in water, allowing to soak for at least 2 hours. The flare should ONLY be worked with when wet as dry core dust may be combustible. <br/>  2. Use a hammer on a soft surface (wood) to crush the wet flare into small pieces, being careful not to smash the igniter cord. Any residual core dust should be kept distant from any potential spark hazard. <br/>  3. Pull the igniter loose from the core and burn it off in a safe location.<br/>  4. Mix the crushed core with equal parts sand, seal in a bag and dispose of with regular waste.<br/><br/>Further information: <br/>-FireQuick Products Website<br/>http://www.firequick.com/index.php<br/>-PMS 443 (Interagency Ground Ignition Guide) Chapter 4 http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/443/pms443_chap4.pdf","06/30/2014 09:29"

Law Enforcement along with all other preserve traffic is forced to share the same repeater frequency.  The command channel for the Orange Blossom fire was forced to use this one repeater frequency as there was no other option at the time.  <br/><br/>On one occasion during a critical afternoon shift all communication on the fireline was shut down due to emergency traffic by law enforcement.  Park Rangers were responding to a car that had driven in to a canal and was submerged in water.  This greatly impacted the fire operations and the safety of all personnel. Several Divisions were involved with burn out operations and direct fire line construction and could no longer use the command channel to communicate across divisions or with Operations and the IC. The incident lasted for almost one hour.  The law enforcement personnel did as they were trained and shut off all traffic except for those involved with the submerged car.   <br/><br/>Resources on the fire line quickly adjusted and started trying to communicate using only their tactical channels and using a helicopter to relay information over the air to ground frequency.  This worked between divisions but the the IC, Ops, and Safety were not close enough to many of the line resources to be able to use the tactical frequency.  The IC, Ops, Safety officer etc... were still dependent on using the Command Channel that uses the Preserve Repeater Frequency's to talk to resources on the fire.  Approximately 50 minutes passed without fire personnel being able to communicate using the command channel.<br/><br/>In an AAR it was brought up that we would have been in serious trouble if there had been a medical incident or extreme weather/fire event on the fire at the same time as the other emergency that Law Enforcement was handling.  Who would have priority on the repeater to talk to dispatch or work with EMS? <br/><br/>In another AAR several fireline personnel explained that the frequent traffic stops by law enforcement, that were called in over the command channel, kept them from being able to get information out over the repeater in a timely manner.  Some traffic stops last for 10 minutes or more and fire personnel were hesitant to start talking over the LEO's.     <br/><br/>Line resources should be commended for finding several solutions to continue to communicate during this time period.  <br/><br/>It also should be noted that the Law Enforcement Officers were just doing their jobs too.  LEO's also noted the same frustrations as the firefighters.  They were trying to handle an incident and traffic stops while the fire was going on.","Once we all realized that we would not be able to use our command frequency we got several resources out to try and act as human repeaters using tactical channels.  The Divisions and Operations began using cell phones when they could get service to communicate.  Several folks were heard using HELCO to relay information.  <br/><br/>Cell phones worked for 3 Divisions out of 4.  The north most Division had to move south to his division break to use his phone but ultimately was able to make contact with Operations and the IC.  <br/><br/>Local resources have been experiencing communication problems for about 10 years.  The sharing of the repeater frequency with all preserve resources, including Law Enforcement, has been an issue on Prescribed fire as well as wildfires.","06/10/2014 07:54"

The only communications that I had with Allegheny Dispatch was through a radio relay with the Bradford Ranger District (BRD) office, and this was by utilizing our 'direct' channel, which is a simplex channel.  Additionally, I was only able to communicate on this simplex channel from my mobile radio.  My portable radio did not have enough power and/or reception to allow for communications.  There is no cell phone coverage in this area.  <br/><br/>I received information on this wildfire at approx. 1500 and arrived onseen within the hour.  We were fortunate that one of the Visitor Assistant's was able to remain at the BRD after 1630 to assist us with communications.  If not for this individual, then I would have been without radio communications with Allegheny Dispatch until other PA-ALF fire resources arrived and local human repeater could be established.<br/><br/>Safety was my main concern because I was not able to be a part of the UC discussions at all times, due to having to remain close to my vehicle to utilize my mobile radio.  This would not have been as much of a concern had I been able to at least communicate on my portable radio at the ICP.  <br/><br/>A second 'work around' to some communication message occurred by having one of the McKean County Emergency Management Agency's employees text one of their 911 dispatchers information.  The 911 dispatcher then relayed this information to Allegheny Dispatch by telephone.<br/><br/>This is an ongoing issue that has been reported on through SAFENET in the past.  Our forest has, at best, 60% radio coverage.  There has been a 'plan' to erect 4 new repeaters on this forest, one of which would have been right in the area of this wildfire.  However, this plan has not been enacted possibly due to funding and/or NEPA.  We can not safely respond to and take action on wildfires without proper communications.","We were fortunate to have one of our BRD Visitor Assistant's remain after their normal duty hours to assist us and act as our radio relay.  If they were not able to remain at work then I would have had no radio communications with Allegheny Dispatch.

The current radio system has poor audio quality. At times it sounds like the speaker system has blown speakers but i don't think they are. I recieved many calls from district personnel saying they called us on the radio but we didn't answer them. I asked them to try me again while i had them on the phone and watched the radio to see if it was me or the radio. It was the radio. Most times I could tell someone was calling dispatch but audio clarity stopped me from understanding the transmittion.The rest of the time the radio would 'beep' and no message at all would come through. The current radio system is hard to determine who is calling because multi 'Call' lights flash across all radio banks.You have to scan through the banks selecting them one at a time to find out which one they are coming across before they end the call or you don't know which one they use. I also had trouble with resources calling out what repeater they were using and i would resond on that repeater but they couldn't hear me. I would change repeaters and they could hear me. (Example a resource called on Tone 8 and i had to use Tone 7 for him to hear me).<br/><br/>- Hunter Valley Fire<br/><br/>Sames issues as above happened during this initial attack fire too. We had no communication by radio to people on the fire. Personnel on the fire had to drive to a differnt location away from the fire to call us by cell phone to give us updates or needs on the fire. We were able to get a Human repeater set up to help with communications. This helped but communication was still bad. Operations on the fire told me even the personnel on the fire could not talk back and forth to each other by radio. We also hear an 'echo' of our transmittion across the radio at times. We thought it was the feed back from the 'unselected' side of the radio system going into the MIC but operations also told us they too were hearing the 'echo' when they were calling.<br/><br/>I suggest that the radio systems gets fixed ASAP before an accident occurs. I also think more repeaters are needed to cover the dead zones across the forest.","Set up Human repeater<br/><br/>Contacted Forest FMO and Radio Tech on problem. Radio Tech. came into dispatch and said that fire should of set up a portable repeater on fire since the Forest knows there is many dead spots. The district that had the fire did not have a portable repeater on that district at that time of fire. Closest one was 3-4hr drive away on an RX burn unit. I was told the Forest had done up a map with the Dead Zones location but dispatch does not have a copy of it so dispatchers know where these are located. The Radio Tech suggested that the radio system set up needs to be changed in dispatch to help with the 'echo' feed back from the speakers in the MIC. He also said the Radio system towers need to be off the dirty floor. Divided work stations are needed to help with the 2 radio dispatching stations from interfering with each other.Radio Tech said fire should of set up the portable repeater so we could talk to the fire but the portable repeaters were never programed into dispatch's radio. The Radio tech is new to the Forest and still getting familiar with the system and he doesn't even know where all the repeater sites are or even has access to them. The repeater sites he has been to, he is finding many problems that need addressed. <br/><br/>I think they need to get more repeater sites installed to help mitigate the large amount of dead zones across the forest.","05/05/2014 08:42"

Dispatch had asked Jumper 49 if they had the frequency to contact Life Flight 77. This is when the communication breakdown occurred. The Jumper 49 air crew assumed Boise Dispatch was referring to victor and FM emergency guard frequencies, but dispatch was referring to the FM Life Flight frequency 155.2800 (which Jumper 49 was not monitoring).","Verbal clerification of frequencies will be used in all emergency situations.

There was one dispatcher for both the FS Forest Net and FS Admin, also monitoring the cooperator intercoms, one dispatcher for all three National Parks, and two dispatchers to split the 18 BLM frequencies.  When the 5th dispatcher arrived for her shift, she assisted with the National Park frequencies.   There was heavy Law Enforcement traffic all morning.  At 1316 we had a report of a single veg fire that then turned into multiple starts, and a reported structure fire with extension into the brush.  I advised the other BLM dispatcher that there were a few LE calls and asked for assistance in monitoring these calls as I then proceeded to dispatch aircraft to the vegetation fires, and tried to assist the FS dispatcher.  While I was dispatching aircraft, the BLM dispatcher got a report of another vegetation fire on BLM and had to dispatch a fire while dealing with multiple LE incidents including a stolen vehicle.  I tried to juggle between dispatching aircraft and taking additional LE calls.  It was physically impossible to answer every radio call thus leaving some LE frequencies unattended. The National Park frequencies also had multiple LE contacts on all three channels.  Along with the radio traffic the 12 phone lines were ringing and each dispatcher did their best to answer them; however our priority was the radio traffic.  At 1608 another report of fires broke out.  Multiple starts along the NB 15 freeway.  I prepared for another aircraft dispatch while juggling the 9 other frequencies I was monitoring.  As I finished my voice out, I got a call for a medical aid involving an unresponsive patient in Ridgecrest.  As I dispatched the medical aid, I lost track of aircraft traffic, cancellations, flight following, and other aircraft in the area.   As I tried to catch up, the phones were ringing, and all frequencies had radio traffic.  In-between these major calls there were a steady stream of pending calls that kept rolling in.  With 5 dispatchers, we ran 97 incidents.  There were 37 admin personnel, 7 chief officers, 4 patrols, and 37 LE (all agencies) staffed that day.   Despite our best efforts, we could not keep up with the heavy call volume.  Leaving frequencies unattended left me feeling uncomfortable and stressed.  In the event of an emergency or life threatening incident involving one of our LE’s or firefighters, I feel we were not equipped to handle an additional emergency.","We all worked together in an extremely stressful situation.

There was 4 fully qualified dispatchers to staff 35 frequencies until 1200 and then 5 dispatchers scheduled to staff those same 35 frequencies from 1200-1800 including breaks for the individual dispatchers.  Agencies involved are US Forest Service San Bernardino N.F., BLM California Desert District, Joshua Tree National N.P., Death Valley N.P, and Mojave NP.<br/>I was the only Dispatcher working the Forest and was responsible for monitoring 8 frequencies including Fire, Law enforcement. Admin, Aircraft dispatching, along with coordinating with other agencies on the Intercom. This is a task normally assigned to 2-3 dispatchers; however I was doing it alone due to a lack of staffing in FICC. <br/>At 1320 I was the IA Dispatcher for the Forest Service I received a report of multiple fires along highway 18 from S.B.City fire, and dispatched a first alarm. Units responding included 6 engines, 2 water tenders , 2 FTP’s, a full aircraft response including 1 air attack, 2 tankers, and 2 helicopters; along with coordinating with CAL FIRE BDU, San Bernardino Co fire, and SB City Fire with the response from those agency and making sure the responding units are on the right Frequencies. At this point the work load became too much for me and I had to give responsibility for Admin, Law Enforcement, and Aircraft Dispatching to another Dispatcher who was already responsible for 9 BLM frequencies and 17 BLM Law Enforcement Officers who were working multiple shooter contact and traffic stops.<br/> At this point I believe it became a life safety issue with not enough dispatchers to handle the work load and it became an unsafe environment for those officers in the field and could set this office, myself and my fellow dispatchers up for potential lawsuit if something were to ever go wrong.  The BLM law enforcement dispatcher had to take my admin, law and aircraft dispatching responsibilities as I was committed to dispatching IA fire resources to multiple fires and coordinate with other agencies via intercom. <br/>At 1608 a near identical set of circumstances happened where I received another report of multiple fires along another highway and had to Dispatch accordingly including a full response from the Forest, and local cooperators and aircraft in which I had to coordinate between 4 separate fires at the same time. Again I had to pass on my duties of aircraft, law enforcement and admin dispatching to a fellow Dispatcher who was already busy with another agency having multiple law enforcement stops, and a non-responsive medical aid.<br/>The Dispatch Center was fully staffed that day with the exception of one supervisor who was home sick. This office (Federal Interagency Communications Center) is under staff at this point and has a continuing problem with back filling positions that are left vacant by other agencies. Combined this with the scheduling change which has moved two additional dispatchers to the graveyard shift, and not replaced on the day shift has left FICC with a critical shortage of qualified dispatchers  during the day. Day time dispatchers have had to work overtime on a nearly daily basses just to maintain a minimum level of staffing. What concerns me is the fact that we have a very severe drought condition and the upcoming fire season fast approaching, Dispatchers are already starting to get burned out and fatigued, without any sign of rest or letting up and this could contribute negatively to the safety of our units and personal in the field that respond to Fire, Law Enforcement, EMS, and the Public.","As my dispatch and radio traffic responsibilities increased I had to get assistance quickly from other dispatchers who were already busy with other Law Enforcement and Medical Aids incidents. Fortunately at this time all my fires where controlled in the Initial Attack and did not go in to Extended Attack. My fellow dispatchers were able to lend a hand however it may have caused some officers safety issue for other agencies at the time. In the short term the office needs to get all the vacant positions filled as soon as possible.<br/>Long term this office needs to get additional staffing in accordance with its call volume in the last 10 years the incident volume has gone from approximately 10,000 incidents a years, to over 20,000 a year while the staffing has stayed at the same level that entire time with no additional staffing added to the org chart.","04/07/2014 11:01"

The burn unit consisted of generally rolling terrain with some steeper slopes along the hardwood bottom and associated river/creek. There was adequate footing in pine straw and hardwood litter fuel bed with pockets of heavier brush and understory. <br/><br/>During prescribed burn operations one of the prescribed fire crew members on the ignition crew received 3rd degree burns to their left leg. The burn accrued between the knee and the top of the boot in the calve area on the inside of the leg.   <br/><br/>The IP was part of a crew of igniters establishing a base line on the prescribed burn in preparation for aerial ignition operations that was going to be used to complete the remainder of the prescribed burn.  <br/><br/>During the process of establishing the base line, the IP worked in coordination with several other lighters to complete the process.  There was excellent coordination and communication between the lighters and all the prescribed burn overhead. The operational tempo was very good; the overhead stressed patience while establishing the base line for this burn.<br/><br/>At some point during the base line operation while in heavy brush and understory the IP's Nomex trousers came in contact with the lighted drip torch they were using, causing the Nomex trousers to ignite, but not burning through the Nomex material.  The IP then used their gloved hand to try and extinguish the flames on the Nomex trousers.  Witnesses and IP reported the fire was difficult to extinguish.  <br/><br/>The IP then continued on with the base line operations proceeding to make a couple of more drifts across the burn unit to complete the operation not realizing the extent of their injuries to their leg.<br/><br/>After completing the base line the overhead had all ignitions personal disengaged and got ready for their new firing assignments for the aerial ignition operations plan, which required relocating igniters to pre-identified locations around the burn unit to facilitate safe and efficient completion of the burn unit.<br/><br/>It was during this period that the IP finally took the time to check the extent of the burn injury.  When the IP noticed the extent of the injury they then brought it to the attention of the Burn Boss.  The Burn Boss then brought it to the attention of the Zone Duty Officer who was also on scene at the time.  The decision was made at that time to send the IP to the nearest burn center. The quickest way to get the IP to the burn center in Augusta, GA was to assign one of the prescribed burn resources to transport the IP directly to the burn center. <br/><br/>The IP was transported to the nearest burn center via GOV; the IP kept the injury from coming in contact with the dirty Nomex trousers (kept the pant leg pulled up above their knee) while irrigating and cooling the injury with clean water during transportation to the hospital.  <br/><br/>The burn boss then contacted the district ranger who helped facilitate the medical paperwork and pass along the information to the Forest Supervisor and others. <br/><br/>The IP spent 3 nights in the burn unit.  Treatment included cleansing of the burn area, surgery for skin grafts, and monitoring for infection.","Ensure JHAs and tailgates cover burn response and treatment along with the need to check all equipment prior to use.<br/><br/>During the Prescribed burn AAR that occurred various items were discussed including the following:<br/><br/>• Utilization of proper PPE(in this case the IP had the appropriate PPE on).<br/><br/>• Conducting tailgate safety sessions and JHAs no matter how routine the tasks maybe.<br/><br/>• Ensure that Situational Awareness, risk/hazard: awareness, mitigation, and management are discussed and implemented throughout the entire operation.  In this case the injury occurred to a collateral duty firefighter with several years of prescribed fire experience.<br/><br/>• The proper PPE was utilized and safety briefings had been conducted, prior to implementation operations; however accidents still can happen when working with flammable liquids on or near the fireline.","04/03/2014 08:06"

I did see a Safenet posted but it wasn't mine or addressing this issue.  So I am resubmitting.<br/><br/>The situation that I am about to describe put 2 FFT2s in a Type 6 Engine without supervision, performing fire suppression operations on an escaped prescribed fire.  I think it was a break down of operational leadership.  Once spot fires became numerous a responsible leader should have gathered his forces to brief on the changing operations.  I feel it was very fortunate that someone didn't get seriously hurt on this day.<br/><br/>On 1/16/2014 the personnel listed above were working on the Austin Bayou RX burn.   Hydratrek ENGB1 was conducting firing operations on the west side of the unit.  After the test fire was complete and ignitions began, ENGB1’s unit proceeded south on the west boundary, all other units were assigned firing and holding operations on the northern boundary lighting to the east.  After about 90 minutes of firing operations ENGB1’s unit was told to cease all firing operations and were put in standby mode.  Communications from the RXB2 indicated there were spot fires on the northern boundary of the burn.  In the next hour and 30 minutes many more spot fires were being reported over the command channel.  RXB2 contacted ENGB1 over the command channel and told ENGB1 to report back to the test fire location and have FFT2 Alpha bring the Type 6 engine (Engine 1) to the northeast corner of the burn to refill another engine (Engine 2) and the UTV that RXB2 was operating.  RXB2's communications were not easy to understand because he was noticeably  elevated in volume.  He was breathing very hard over the radio and was shouting orders to those around him while still having his transmit button on his radio depressed.  When FFT2 Alpha was dropped off at Engine 1, RXB2 contacted ENGB1 over the command channel and ask where Engine 1 was.  ENGB1 informed RXB2 that FFT2 Alpha had been dropped at the Engine and he was headed his way.  RXB2 said he needed to hurry and 'not so spare the gas'.  FFT2 Alpha proceeded down an undeveloped roadway that had many mudholes and that was in general disrepair.  Again within minutes RXB2 was on the command channel telling FFT2 Alpha to hurry, that the fire was about to jump a major ditch.  Communication was unclear because the RXB2 seemed be under great stress.  <br/><br/>Upon Alpha's arrival at the requested location on the NE side of the Unit he was met by the ENGB of Engine 2.  Engine 2 took the lead to work on the threatened ditch and RXB2  assigned FFT2 (Bravo) to go on Engine 1 with FFT2 Alpha to patrol the line for a mile as it followed the ditch north of the present location.  FFT2 Alpha was driving and took the lead position and FFT2 Bravo rode shotgun.  Engine 1 went direct on 2 spot fires on the first patrol of the line along the ditch.  FFT2 Alpha reported back to RXB2 on the command channel that they had encountered 2 spot fires and had got them under control.  When turning around at the end of the line to be patrolled, Engine 1 came into contact with Marsh Master ENGB3 and Hydratrek ENGB4.  <br/><br/>We knew prior to the operations that day that if we had slop overs and had to go direct, we were going to be short of qualified engine bosses.  The equipment wasn't there for contingency but rather for operational needs to complete the normal operations.  No one on the fire crew or the collateral fire folks thought we would be in a situation for rolling a Type 6 engine through hot lines without supervision on an Engine Boss on board.<br/><br/>When Engine 1 reached the far end of the fire line that they were assigned to patrol FFT2 Alpha tied in with ENGB4 and ENGB3 on the Hydratrek and Marsh Master.  Alpha explained the situation that him and FFT2 Bravo had caught 2 spot fires.  He also explained that Engine 1 didn't have a qualified engine boss on board.  ENGB3 and ENGB4 briefed FFT2 Alpha on the situation they were dealing with and the spot fires they were dealing with.","In the after action review at 22:15 on 16 January 2014, ENGB3 brought it to the attention to RXB2 that he was hurrying people and someone was going to get hurt.  Everyone seemed to agree that putting a Type 6 engine on spot fires and working a line patrolling without an ENGB was a bad decision.  Also brought out was the fact that there were many spots going on with equipment getting wide spread.  RXB2 didn't seem to know who was located where or what they were doing.","02/13/2014 08:10"

His last valid red card expired on March 19, 2013.  Furthermore, on January 8, 2014 that IC requested that TDC change the IC to another individual.  Upon review of IQCS records, that individual's highest qualification on his red card is FFT2. Therefore there was not a qualified ICT5 on the Beaver Pond Wildland Fire as required by policy.  <br/><br/>Events such as this is uncalled for and could place the federal government in a liable position if in the event someone should be injured or killed.  Albeit the fire was small, a consensus is that protcols should be followed on every fire every time.","Documentation sent to the SWRO Fire Staff and Forestry Staff.  <br/>Input of events into the SAFENET program.","01/27/2014 14:45"

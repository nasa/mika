Crew members were not notified of this situation until load up to leave camp, and were not given opportunity to come up with alternative at this time due to the need to “load up right now”. 1 of the trucks made the correct decision and put the 6th member in additional seat on front bench that had a seat belt. Leadership of the other truck insisted that 4 personnel needed to sit in the backseat, as Squadee and trainee insisted there were radios and lunches in the front seat that could not be moved. Squadee and Squadee trainee had front bench to the 2 of them, with adequate space and access to seatbelts. Prior to leaving camp in Susanville, opposition to 4 personnel in backseat was brought up by multiple crew members due to spacing and lack of seat belts. Those in opposition to this plan were told to “fucking deal with it” by Squadee and Squadee trainee. Leadership repeatedly compared the situation to worse situations within the company, where 7+ had been forced to ride in one truck as justification. During the drive from Susanville to DP146 (approx. 30 miles of highway driving on early morning snowy roads, due to snowfall of approx 3 inches overnight) the 4 personnel on backbench were unable to wear seatbelts due the lack of space and “dog pile” involved in getting 4 large males into the back bench. In addition, the passenger rear door of truck 652 has been non-operational (stuck closed with no ability to open, even upon inspection and troubleshooting) since arriving at Dixie fire 10/9. In the event of emergency, the only means of egress for rear seat crew members would be the driver rear door, assuming this door was unimpaired by a potential incident. <br/><br/>Upon reaching DP146, the issue was brought up again, and crew members insisted a better situation be found. Squadee and Squadee Trainee brought these crew members aside individually to ease tensions, and further justification was given, though it was still insisted that the situation must stand with 4 unbelted passengers in backbench. Following overhead briefing at DP146, the entire crew briefed about plan for the shift. One of the crew members of 652 brought up the issue to the crew boss at this time, as opportunity to bring the issue to a higher level had not been available due to being told to “load up now and stop bitching about seatbelts”. Crew boss trainee took side of 652 leadership and compared the situation to worse situations in the past within the company and said it was something personnel had to “suck up”. Crew boss expressed his disapproval of the situation and insisted that leadership of 652 mitigate the situation by doing the right thing and ensuring all crew members have adequate space and access to seatbelts. Leadership of 652 took retributive action, and continued to ridicule the crew member who brought up the issue by using harsh and unfriendly wording for the remainder of shift.","Opposition to having 4 unbelted crew members in back seat was brought to truck 652 leadership prior to leaving camp in Susanville. Utilizing the 3rd seat (with belt) on front bench was offered as a solution at this time. A stop was made at a gas station in Susanville and the issue and corrective action was brought up again at this time. <br/><br/>The issue was finally corrected at DP146 once firm direction from crew boss was given to remedy the situation.","11/02/2021 08:55"

I’ve been gainfully employed by USDA Forest Service as a primary firefighter since 1994.<br/><br/>This near burn-over took place on Saturday, August 28, 2021, between 1310 hrs. and 1425 hrs.  We had a solid DIV actual and a very weak DIV trainee.  That morning, the DIV trainee provided minimal morning briefings and failed to provide ‘Leaders Intent’.  This trainee rarely provided leaders intent, maintained a negative attitude throughout his training assignment.  For example:  If resources asked any questions regards to their assignment and/or task our trainee frequently responded by yelling and frequently used vulgar language.  On August 28, 2021, I informed the Captain that I needed diesel fuel and still need my General Message Form IC-213 signed.  We were spiked out (Silver Fork Ranch) without any diesel tender.  At approx. 1640 hrs. while DIV Lima was staging, this TFLD said “Hey DIV trainee, WT257 needs to talk to you.  When I was started talking with our trainee, he walked away and crossed his arms.  So, I kept talking and our trainee finally replied, “geez go get diesel, because will be in staging for the remainder of the shift”.<br/><br/>On the morning of August 28, 2021, all division resources were spread out along Silver Fork road between Caple’s Creek Trailhead and the main fire’s path that was burring aggressively towards Silver Fork Road with extreme fire behavior.<br/>Silver Fork Road distances: Caple’s Creek Trailhead (water fill site) to Silver Fork Ranch is 3.5 miles.<br/>Silver Fork Ranch to M.E.T. (Mormon Emigration Trail Rd.) is 12.9 miles.  The total distance of 16.4 miles.<br/><br/>Prior to engaging our assignments DIV training never brought up 3 of the 4 LCES.  We did not have preplanned LOOKOUTS, ESCAPE ROUTES, nor SAFETY ZONES in place.  We only had COMMUNICATIONS established (Forest Command and CDF T26 for tactical radio frequencies).  Unfortunately, radio communications were spotty at best, and no established human repeaters were within our division.  The division resources knew where these said land markers along the Silver Fork road were, and many of the resources spiked out at this Silver Fork Ranch.  Caldor Fire was producing extreme fire behavior, short-range spotting, long-range spotting, torching, crowning, and the Probability of Ignition was 100%.<br/><br/>Division resources were assigned to prep and hold the Silver Fork road.  CalFire even stated, “Hold Silver Fork road at all cost”.  As the main fire approached the Silver Fork Rd., it was spotting up to and over the Silver Fork Rd.  Several of the resources stated to DIV and/or DIV trainee over our tactical radio frequency “numerous spots across the road”, “Active torching along the road”, and “we are engaging numerous spots across the road”.  I was on an FS Support Water Tender approx.  4 miles south of the Silver Fork Ranch facing towards Silver Fork Ranch.  Various engines within eyesight were spraying water to help slow the fire’s rate of spread, and one Type 2 hand crew was on foot, spread out within the green along the eastside of Silver Fork Rd.  At 1310 hrs. significant fire behavior bumped our section of the road and the tactical radio frequency then became jammed with radio traffic.  DIV trainee provided no ‘Leaders Intent’ and our DIV actual had to step in.  DIV actual then declared an emergency distress command over tac and gave the order for all division resources to stop immediately and get out.   This was never backed up by DIV trainee and some resources were confused on what resources are to get out.  After several more calls from DIV actual declaring an emergency get out, I had to drive .25 miles to an adequate turnaround spot, because my closes egress was to M.E.T. intersection.  At this time, the smoke was getting much thicker, and the visibility then dropped to approx. 25 feet of visibility.  During this time several engines were traveling too fast for conditions and nearly causing several head-on collisions, I chose to drive into the ditch several times to avoid these head-on collisions.  I then noticed numerous of our resources heading in all different directions and I was caught in the middle.  After turning around, I noticed this hand crew still standing in the green.  So, I pulled to the side and jumped out to confirm they heard our emergency get-out with the Firestorm crew and they were unaware of the emergency get-out orders by DIV.  This hand crew member then contacted their crew boss via their crew tac.  Their crew boss stated he wasn’t monitoring CDF T26 tactical and was unaware of this emergency get-out.  So, this unequivocally caused additional delays with our emergency get-out.  Their crew boss then decided to contact the DIV trainee over CDF T26 and ask if our division was pulling out?  This caused additional delays to receive confirmation as the division was pulling out.  I was unwilling to start my egress until this hand crew confirmed this emergency get out.<br/>Once this hand crew received confirmation of the emergency get-out, I then ran back over to my water tender.  This was the first time I heard with clarity over tac from DIV actual:  All resources on Division Lima get out.  All resources south of Silver Fork Ranch head south to M.E.T. (Mormon Emigrant Trail) Silver Fork intersection, and all resources north of Silver Fork Ranch head to Silver Fork Ranch, and any resources north of Silver Fork Ranch head to Caple’s Creek Trailhead immediately!  GET OUT!<br/><br/>Once I finally started my egress, the main fire was already bumping the road with extreme fire behavior and the visibility was dropping fast.  I had a Type 3 engine directly in front of me and we could only travel about 30 feet before we had to stop due to fire burning across the road.  So, we spent 30 terrifying minutes playing leapfrog between the flames burring across the road.  I had my Kestrel on because the DIV trainee never assigned anyone to take nor broadcast our weather conditions.  During these troubling times, my water tender cab began to fill with smoke and excessive heat.  I started to sweat ferociously from the building heat, cough uncontrollable, eyes were burning & tearing up due to thick smoke, and my sinuses were draining immensely down dripping to my thighs.  Approximately 20 minutes into this I could not see my hands directly on the steering wheel because of the thick smoke inside my vehicle cab and I thought to myself “I’m probably not going to make it”.  At this point, I said a quick prayer and made my peace with God, and said my final goodbyes to my family and loved ones.  As the smoke continued to thicken inside my water tender, I started to gag and vomit while gasping for air.  Shortly after vomiting I then noticed the smoke starting to decrease, so I then frantically rolled down my window again and noticed there was a wind shift causing the smoke and flames to head back into the main fire.  I was overwhelmed to see this and used this opportunity to continue my egress towards M.E.T. intersection.  I reached this intersection at 1440 hours. I then noticed my Kestrel device was left on and it was showing the inside of my vehicle cab reached 148 degrees.  Clearly, I was placed in harm's way...","I reported this near burn over to several Federal engines, my adopted taskforce leader (because the DIV trainee always forgot to assign me to 1 of 3 of his taskforces), and I tried to report this directly to the DIV trainee, but he clearly didn’t what to hear what I had to say and subsequently walked off.<br/><br/>After this near burn over, I started this consistent coughing and other medical conditions that slowly worsened over time.  I did visit the Caldor Medical Unit on/or about August 31st and they said it was smoke-related and prescribed Halls cough drops.  I re-visited the Medical Unit on/or about September 1st and they said the same thing.  After I was released from Caldor on the morning of September 2nd, I returned to my home unit and visited my local hospital (Modoc Medical Center).  By this time, I was coughing up blood for 24 hours.  I was released from the hospital on September 3rd, and I was diagnosed with smoke inhalation and acute bronchitis.  The ER doctor said “If this near burn over or whatever you're calling this incident would have lasted for an additional 90 seconds or so, you probably wouldn’t have survived.  He also recommended I see a mental health counselor for this traumatic life-threatening event.  As of today (9/15/2021) I still have a persistent cough and all my COVID tests have been negative.  <br/><br/><br/>Lastly, I have a Waterproof Digital Camera HD 2.7K 48 MP Video Recorder camera and I took several photographs and videos prior, during, and after reaching safety from this near burn-over event.  These said photographs and video are stamped with date/time (minutes & seconds) that shows the timeline, fire behavior, etc. available upon request.

Owner calls later that day, “sorry, we’re sending you a real loser for an engine boss”. Owner’s daughter “he’s a weak engine boss”. Me “how bad could he possibly be?” Me and first season swamper drive 800 miles to fire, neither have experience on this particular engine, nor does the engine boss, we find out after picking him up at airport. Me and swamper try running pump with no luck before check in, call engine owner (not company owner)for troubleshooting advice and finally drive to his location (somewhat proximal to basecamp) to have him show us. Checking in, engine boss has little to no idea how to do so (check in). Three days pass before CTRs get signed because engine boss is unsure how to fill them out. Engine boss has to ask other engine boss on fire line how to use new King radio and clone mobile off it. Me, finding one spot with cell signal, calling engine owner for more troubleshooting advice until he says “have engine boss call me because he, not you, is responsible for running the engine and troubleshooting”. Crew subsequently becomes well-versed in intricacies of pumping and drafting after three days on line. Swamper and myself continue to do damage control as engine boss gives confusing orders or no orders at all. Meanwhile, blow through two sticks of one-inch and two sticks of toy hose that were well-used prior. All the while, hose reel leaking like a sieve (engine owner “I guess that didn’t get fixed”). Tire on engine that barely passed inspection gets balder. Engine boss, incapable of backing up engine to hose lay tie-in, instead does two separate 70 point turns in 8 foot wide dozer line, repeatedly backing into embankment and brake-torquing the engine to spin it around while hammering front tires and linkages (I offered to back it up a several times). Next day (day 7) while staged at the head of the fire, I see that one of the rear tires is cratered and shredded in several places. I insist on changing the tire before heading to back down the hill through the burn. No jack on board, though listed on most recent inventory. Borrow jack from another engine, try to get lug nuts off with two men turning wrench, seized on. Leave shredded tire on but have to dump water to minimize weight, leaving engine and crew defenseless driving through burn. Me, upon departure, telling owner’s daughter to find a new engine boss or I’m pulling engine off the line. On second thought, I’ll instead quit because I can’t trust they’ll find an adequate replacement and may have to return to the line with current engine boss. Company owner’s daughter and engine owner to me “you have 20 years experience, why didn’t you know this and know that?” Me, I do have twenty years experience but on completely different setups than this one. Also, my home unit does not utilize the King radio and our pumps are self-priming, gasoline operated. Both issues could have been mitigated by an hour or two run-through by an experienced company employee. Between myself and the swamper, we kept things going for half the roll, working extremely well with hand crews to mop up on Divisions T, U, W, and R. Once we were put at the head on the first Red Flag day, the fact that we would be facing the oncoming fire with no leadership and a liability associated with the engine boss, it became clear to two of us that we should not be on that fire. I wanted to be on that fire more than anyone, but not under those conditions.","Several calls to engine owner (I made the calls) to troubleshoot engine not making pressure and missing or leaking equipment.<br/><br/>Assistance from other line resources.<br/><br/>Reviewing videos to familiarize self with new Kings.<br/><br/>Checked out additional hand-held from Comms which I was more familiar with.<br/><br/>Calling Ground Support to set up tire change.<br/><br/>Call to owner of company for new engine boss.<br/><br/>Based on prior experience and lack of support by Company, resigned my position on engine and was told by engine owner to demobilize the engine the following day (31 August 21).

On the late afternoon on Friday August 6, 2021, the fire spotted over primary control lines in multiple areas of the fire, an Air Attack was requested to manage additional air craft needs. Due to limited egress routes, resources began to fall back to the drop points and reassess the situation. Division N recognized an opportunity to push a dozer line down the hill to the 5801 road and carry fire downhill. The objective was to secure the northeastern edge. Field Operations agreed to this tactic. A short Crew, Dozer and a HEQB, were assigned to complete this. When Air Attack got over the incident, they received a briefing from Field Operations.<br/><br/>While completing the burnout the crew identified a Large Tanker was inbound and lined up on their burnout. The leader from the crew relayed to the ground resources to clear the line. There was not enough time to clear. Retardant drift from this tanker minimally hit the resources on the ground. A second large air tanker followed the first tanker on the same line. The second tanker dropped directly on top of some the members of the crew and HEQB. <br/><br/>Conversation with the ground resources involved was consistent that they did not know that the retardant tankers were inbound or the location they were going to drop. There was no dry run by the tankers prior to the drop. When following up with the Air Attack, he believed that all resources were off the fire at the Drop Point.<br/><br/>I have confirmed with the OWF Aviation Officer that all retardant ships assigned to this incident were IA carded.<br/><br/>The following the Air Operations Summary is from Field Operations.<br/><br/>0530 - tactics meeting – discussed retardant in Division Sierra – decision made to defer due to exclusion zone issues and plan to prep for possible burn operation Sunday.<br/><br/>1030 – requests to planning operations for Type 1 helicopter and discussion for Scoopers were not met due to priority availability.<br/><br/>1100 – Type 2 helicopters working to support NW corner of November grounded due to drone sighted – Fire Bosses eventually replaced helicopters. <br/><br/>1215 – request made by fire crews through the divisions to have helicopters resume operations – worked to mitigate that as air attack was determined to be unavailable. Helicopter up and fire bosses released. <br/><br/>1330 – communication that Type 2’s rotor wings with long turnaround time between the bucket fill location and fire, were having difficulty keeping up with fire activity along Division N. Met with forest duty officer who shared observation from Stillko lookout that we were seeing eddy air current in Sierra that would make spotting problematic along 5801 near the S/N division break. 5801 is only access/egress for crews in lower part of November and all of Sierra as well as lookouts and overhead. Noted.<br/><br/>1540– radio traffic regarding spots along 5801 – working with hand crews to contain<br/><br/>1550 – spot fires are not contained – dozer and Div N are assessing – communicated with S and N – Field Ops requesting assessment of whether we were likely or unlikely to catch the spots with resources on site – warned of possible disengagement. Began to move resources to DP 20. Div N indicated that they had a plan and would attempt to use dozer to create and widen dozer line on north side of fire to catch spots. Plan also included burnout as they descended.<br/><br/>1620 Sierra and Lookouts/Overhead moved to DP 20.<br/><br/>1630 – became aware that air attack was on site – had brief conversation with air attack as to where we had resources and the fact that dozer and Crew 52 were working down the north flank – otherwise all other resources had moved to DP 20. Some resources were sent down to DP 3 from DP 20. Equipment retrieved from A/N.<br/><br/>1600 – Air Attack was communicating intermittently with November and Field Ops – noticed that we had tankers, Fire Bosses, Scoopers and Helicopters in air. Field Operations spoke with Planning Ops / IC about planning for balance of shift – Field ops was requested to ICP. Divisions advised to monitor A/G 1 and provide air attack with information as needed.<br/><br/>1730 – radio traffic indicating that a tanker had to divert from drop due to crew in the way. <br/><br/>1745- Later found that was actually post drop and that 4-6 members of Crew 52 and Dozer crew had some retardant dropped near or on them. Checked for injuries – none. <br/><br/>2015 – reported incident to IC / Safety.<br/><br/>The following is summary from the Air Attack:<br/><br/>Air Attack 617 arrived on scene at approximately 1645 and made contact with Field Ops on the A/G channel. I asked him for a brief on the fire, situation, priorities and objectives.  He provided the fire layout with divisions and priorities.  We were to support Div N and Div A with air support. I asked him what personnel were on the fire and he replied, “all personnel are clear of the line and down at the heel of the fire at the parking areas and staging”.<br/><br/>I ordered 3 scoopers, 2 fire boss, and 3 large air tankers, and 2 type 2 helicopters from CWICC in addition to the 2 helicopters already on scene. I received 2 scoopers, 2 fire boss, 3 large air tankers, 1 type 2 helicopter-that swapped with one of the other type 2 helicopters.<br/><br/>After setting up routes, check points, and sequencing with the 2 scoopers and helicopters in preparation for the arrival of the large air tankers and fire boss aircraft, I attempted contact with the Ops and received Div N.  I briefed him on the plan for retardant, Scoopers, and Fire boss aircraft with the existing helicopters target areas. I received the 1st air tanker and gave a target description and confirmed that we had the same target area and objective. I cleared that air tanker to maneuver and cleared it to drop, and the line was clear.  All other aircraft were at their scoop locations or at a designated check point. The first tanker made their drop and exited the TFR.  The second air tanker was enroute and had already checked in.  They were looking for the first tanker exiting to Moses.<br/><br/>The second tanker came on scene and we had a discussion about the target area and the plan to tag and extend off the first tankers drop.  They confirmed the target, objective and stated ‘they were ready to go”. I cleared them to maneuver and to drop, the area was clear.  I had already confirmed the other air traffic’s positions and where they were enroute to the fire from the dip site or scoop site.<br/><br/>When the second tanker started their drop, they stopped their drop about halfway through the expected load and executed a go-a-round.  They stated, “that there was personnel on the line”.  They immediately climbed back to pattern altitude and waited for me to clear the line with OPS. When I called for OPS, I got a response from Div N.  When I asked him about the personnel on the line and said that we did not know they were there.  He responded with, “yes, that was a mis-communication”. I asked him to call me when the line had been cleared.  Which he did a few minutes later.<br/><br/>I asked the air tanker to remain in pattern altitude until I confirmed the line was clear.  I then sequenced the helicopters and scoopers to their target areas, which were on the other flank of the fire, and exits to their respective dips. Once the line had been cleared and confirmed with the Div N, the tanker was cleared again to maneuver and drop, and the area was clear.  There were 5 additional air tanker drops made on the fire to complete the line and meet the objective with 4 air tankers. As well as additional calls to Div A to make sure we had traffic control on their main access road and when to hold or clear traffic on the road in sequence with the air tanker drops. No other incidences were relayed via radio.<br/><br/>It was not until the morning of 8/7, that I found out from the Safety officer that the first drop had almost dropped on ground personnel and that the second drop had been dropped on personnel. The Safety officer stated that they were writing a Safecom on the incident.  In our conversation, I asked that they write a Safenet as well.  Both reports should address the topic of Communication.<br/><br/>The following is a summary from Division N.<br/><br/>On August 6 after we had fire spot over our line we had air resources in the air shortly after.  Division Novembers dozer was working down the northeast flank of the line with the crew 52 bringing fire behind.  There had been water drops in the area of the burn operation.  From my vantage point a retardant ship appeared from the west and laid a retardant line over the crew and the dozer line.  After the drop had been made air attack contacted Div. November on the Radio asking if we had personnel on the line and that they had more ships coming in.  We were able to move the crew and the dozer out of the path of the planned retardant drops after the initial drop.<br/><br/>A follow up with conversation with Division N clarified that he had no contact with Air Attack until after the retardant drops. The retardant associated with this incident is inside of the control lines, leaving treated, unburned fuel. This has resulted in additional exposure to firefighters to secure this line.<br/><br/>Communication was a key element that contributed to this incident. It should reemphasize the importance of clear communication between all resources on the incident. Communication is both given and received. All resources need to be aware of objectives, ongoing tactics, and location of adjacent resources.<br/><br/>Both a Safecom and Safenet will be submitted.","All individuals involved were debriefed within 24 hours of the incident. All personnel relayed that communication was the common key element that contributed to this incident. Two-way communication ensuring that all resources are aware of objectives, tactics, resources, and the location of resources will be given and confirmed. <br/><br/>During rapidly developing situations Air and Ground resources need to have an understanding of the common operating picture.<br/><br/>State and local Forest Aviation Officers, Agency Administrators, and local Duty Officers have been notified.","08/16/2021 11:25"

The fire was lit on private property and possibly on the adjoining Forest Service land, specifically the Helena National Forest.<br/><br/>This fire, ostensibly lit to stop the distant Woods Creek Fire, spread rapidly in fine fuels and was discovered by the incident Air Attack on the morning of the sixth.  The fire grew to several thousand acres, necessitated a new evacuation order being issued for the incident to the south, and eventually merged with the Woods Creek Fire to the north in the early hours of Aug. 7th, according to the first available IR.<br/><br/>While the group who lit the fire claim minimal coordination with the IMT, they seem to delight in having taken swift, decisive action with little or no IMT interaction.  This flies in the face of NWCG agreed-upon rules for suppression operations using the Incident Command System (ICS), even in a unified command situation, which this clearly was not.  Wildland firefighters rely on a common operating picture with clear leader’s intent for a safe workplace.  This firing operation was not specified on the ICS-204s for the day’s Incident Action Plan (IAP), the resources engaged in the burn operation were not on the 204s, and most importantly, crew’s nearest the area, assigned to the Woods Creek Fire, were not briefed on this operation and were surprised by this new fire activity outside the previously known Woods Creek perimeter shown on their IAP map.  This could have been a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>With this new activity, a new incident, the Needles Fire (MT-MTHDC-000412), was created in the computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system at the Helena Interagency Dispatch Center. Through the Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information (IRWIN) system, a corresponding entry was made into the Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) were it remains today.  While the jurisdiction can’t be determined by the fire number in WFDSS, the reported location was on USFS land very near a private property line.  The IMT then submitted a series of three ICS-209s reporting resources and acreage for the Needles Fire using the number MT-HLF-000412, implying Forest Service jurisdiction.  The final size is reported at 2852 acres.  <br/><br/>The Needles Fire only appeared one day on the National Sit Report before Inciweb and Helena CAD entries were deleted. This, after the incident was widely reported in the media as being a human-caused new ignition.  Speaking of WFDSS, for the Woods Creek Fire neither the decision prior to the Needles Fire (8/3), nor the one after (8/12) made mention of the incident.  One would think the approver would have mentioned absorbing a 3000-acre new fire. The official story would be that there were never two different fires, and everyone was collaborating in a wonderful way to protect the citizenry.<br/><br/>It is clear the IMT reacted as if this were a new fire, previously unknown to them.  Not having an operation of this magnitude accounted for in the IAP and integrated into the Operations Section of the IMT could have proven deadly.  The Incident Meteorologist called for rain on Sunday the 8th with erratic winds preceding the rain – not an optimal forecast for a large-scale firing operation.  Rather than patience, the individuals became alarmed as the fire grew closer. Then, with no authority pulled the trigger. “There was not one IMT firefighter on the scene of the burn. Not. One,” crows the writer of an article from an eyewitness account.  Was there no communication with the Woods Creek incident, when ignition began?  There should have been a Division/Group Supervisor or a Branch Director from the team to integrate an operation like this.  It would be interesting to know the NWCG qualifications of those doing the burning. Was there a Firing Plan or a Firing Boss?<br/><br/>The instances of poorly communicated firing operations resulting in death, injury, and near-misses are too numerous to mention. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) investigation into the 2003 Cedar Fire fatality endorsed the following pertinent safety recommendations:<br/><br/>•	Firing operations should be supervised by qualified personnel<br/>•	Firing operations should be coordinated with incident command and crews operating in the area<br/>•	Firing operations should be done by trained personnel that have authorization from their supervisor and the command staff<br/>•	Constant radio communications must be maintained so firing operations can be coordinated with other fireline operations<br/>•	Escape routes and safety zones should be identified and clearly marked before starting firing or burn-out operations<br/>•	If firing out becomes too intense for the crews to control, it should be stopped until control is regained and the firing operation is modified to reduce the intensity<br/>•	Firing operations should be initiated from and terminated at an anchor point.<br/><br/>It is clear these accepted guidelines for a large-scale firing operation were not followed. While these actions may or may not constitute arson, as late as the 20th Century, lighting a fire without the knowledge of the USFS by a Native American could result in your child being taken and sent to boarding school for the purpose of assimilation. But that was the old West.  <br/><br/>For decades, wildland firefighters have been told that accidents and near-misses will receive a transparent investigation, so others may learn from the experience.  It would appear in this case, that the firing on August 6th is being considered an integrated part of the Woods Creek incident, and that the IMT was completely in the loop.  It seems individuals then conspired to expunge any record of the Needles Fire.  It would seem that an oversight of this magnitude would trigger an After Action Review (AAR) between State and Feds, or an interagency team might be assembled to produce a facilitated learning analysis (FLA), but since this involves politically connected characters, it seems the normal rules don’t apply.<br/><br/>Amid perceived allegations of lawmakers and attorneys intimidating the team IC and staff at the Incident Command Post (ICP), demanding a private individual be allowed to fly a personal helicopter in violation of the temporary flight restriction (TFR), so the person could direct “operations,” and demands for document shredding, this kind of political distraction is also a safety concern.  Today’s IMT members are stretched thin to begin with in our current climate emergency.  Members of the public, more and more, are appearing on the fireground armed with weapons and are filled with wild conspiracies ranging from government malfeasance to ANTIFA arson.  Turning a blind eye to poorly-executed wild West antics by landowners ensures others will be emboldened to do the same.  Like the Hammond arson case, disdain for Federal oversight, and hubris like this is exactly what leads to unsafe conditions for firefighters on the ground. A potential tragic loss of life was averted, but this incident should still be investigated thoroughly. <br/><br/>Though the mentioned article reads as a feel-good local control piece, it underscores and celebrates the lack of operational integration.  Before we accept “the locals save the day” narrative, in might be good to check the facts.  After chasing the massive unplanned extension of the fire for two days, on Sunday, August 9th, the entire area received up to an inch or more of rain, halting or slowing the fire spread (especially in the lower elevation fine fuels ignited by the private individuals).  The entire extension of the Woods Creek fire to the southeast was unnecessary.  It did nothing to protect property or diminish the threat to firefighters and the public.  It did quite the opposite.","Filed this SAFENET","09/01/2021 16:36"

Their assignment was not known other than they were “going in from the bottom.”  There was silence and secrecy about it, being that one member swapped out of one role to another and no one seemed to know what he was doing.  Two days later while on patrol for new fires during a red flag warning with an LAL of 4, I started catching radio traffic between two individuals.  They had worked together for many years before this.  Between the radio traffic and fire behavior on the northern edge of the fire, it became obvious they were conducting a burnout operation, the day of predicted thunderstorms.  The winds changed directions and picked up and the fire spotted across the river just before dark and my engine was in the area but on our way back to the station.  We were grabbed by someone in leadership and asked to follow him.  I went along and showed him the road system above where the spots were on the north side of the river.  The few people that were at the end of the road left after a bit, figuring there was nothing 3 people could do about a 30 acre spot over a half mile down a steep grassy slope.  As far as I know, no one got hurt but the people making the decisions to perform a burnout on the day of a predicted weather event have made similar decisions in the past to conduct burning operations soon before weather events that brought changing winds putting unnecessary fire on the landscape and more people at risk to deal with that fire.

We were operating out of the Canyon work center and warm meals were provided in coolers from the fire camp up the road.  The individual with the gluten intolerance cannot consume gluten and cannot consume food that was touched by any food containing gluten. After coming back to camp that evening we were told by the person running logistics that the caterer will not make any gluten free meals because it wasn't in their contract to do so. The following day every meal contained gluten besides breakfast. The next four days all the meals contained gluten. Note, if the caterer would've sent us breakfast with no bread on top of these prepackaged meals the individual would've been able to eat breakfast. Halfway through the assignment we had to make a trip to the town over to have the individual resupply on food they could eat while working for this incident. We drove almost two hours to Orofino and the individual had to pay out of pocket to eat while operating on the Swanson Creek fire. Just to be clear the entire meal did not contain gluten but as most firefighters know all you get for lunch is a sandwich, some random veggies, a grandma's cookie, and if you're lucky candy.

I asked the contractors if I could exclude gluten from my meal, they were happy to assist. There is a separate contractor providing lunches, although the breakfast/lunch contractors stated that they could provide me with a GF lunch if I fill out a form with the food unit leader. I asked one food unit leader, she directed me to come back in 15-20 minutes, upon return she informed me that the instant that I returned there was a change in directive and she could not provide me assistance in getting GF meals. I had a friendly conversation with her, providing her that I am not getting the calorie count I need, but understanding that the food contracts need updated at the Washington Office level. After speaking to her, I went back to work knowing I cannot request these meals. Her counterpart, another FUDL sought me out and brought the contract to inform me the exact wording, and proceeded to tell me the same information as the former FUDL had. I was kind, understood, and she proceeded to tell me that I am in the wrong career field if I have food allergies and that I should find another place to work. She also told another individual standing with me who informed her she has a severe food allergy that she 'better carry her epipen with her at all times'. I did not find these as being appropriate responses, especially due to the fact that I had not sought her out to complain nor ask for lunches. I was told one thing, it was clarified with me from overhead that they could not provide me what the contractors were offering, and understanding this I was still sought out and told to leave my career due to a food allergy.","I no longer asked to have GF meals, used my own money to purchase GF food in the nearest local town with permission from my supervisor out of my own pocket, and am avoiding gluten to the best of my ability. I also informed my supervisor of the unkind words used by this FUDL individual, and I believe he may have had a conversation with her but nothing has changed in the ICP. <br/><br/>I think it is important that we request a change in contract before the ending date of the contract to provide for individuals with reactions such as these so that there is less of an issue. I understand that I can get an exemption, but I would have to pay for a doctors fee, get approval, and have it brought down the line still for them to simply take out gluten rather than providing an appropriate calorie count for what I am working when on the line as a FFT1/HECM(T)/REAF(T)/ENGB(T). It is frustrating that we are able to provide for a chosen food consumption request but not for one that causes reactions outside of the bodies normal functions. <br/><br/>Generally in the lunches I am able to eat: fruits, veggies, eggs, and SOMETIMES granola bars. <br/><br/>In the breakfasts and dinners I can generally consume: meat (depending on what it's seasoned with), eggs, potatoes, salad (without crutons and depending on dressing), coleslaw, beans, fruit, and a few other things. These are less of an issue because I can usually consume enough to get by, as long as it isn't a pasta meal or something in a flour tortilla/smothered in gravy/breaded.","09/24/2021 08:21"

Sent at 1116PM.","Though I am slow to eventually check my messages, I picked up my phone to read the message, roughly 4mins later and responded with uplifting messages back.  Facebook messenger showed that he never read the messages until the next morning.  At the same time of sending him messages, I know and am friends with the lead dispatcher at the local area dispatch office.  I sent her a message with the message I received and asked if they could reach out this individual.  The dispatcher in the morning got back to me that they would find them.  They tried calling him and he didn’t answer.   And that he hadn’t been back to work either.  Dispatch then contacted his duty officer.  Following which, they said, they had spoken to him on the phone and that he was ok.  And that they were sending a close friend to sit and talk with him.  <br/><br/>I reflect on the events and options I had in which to respond and reach out to my friend.  I could have called 911, but I myself am hesitant, this is my friend and fellow firefighter, is this really the best option to maintain our friendship and working relationship?  Much less know where they are. Suicide hotline, I couldn’t tell you there number much less hope, my friend would get my FB messenger message and call it.<br/><br/>Additional Suggestions for the future.<br/>All firefighters are tracked nationally, whether there at home or on a fire, we roughly know where they are at during fire season.  I knew my friend last we talked was at the local dispatch.  I know where he his permanent duty station is.  From those two locations, either one could get in the ROSS/IROC and track down whether they are at home or on assignment.  At home usually the duty officer knows, or a coworker knows where someone is or going to be roughly.  On assignment, tracking to the incident and then tracking through planning section should at least give a name of supervisor that would know where that individual is.  <br/>All this can happen quite fast given ROSS/IROC.  Dispatch can than notify the duty officer, who can then send a fellow firefighter or supervisor to check on them and make the appropriate calls from further help if needed.  Additionally, it maybe that if needed or per SOP medics and psychologist are on standby. It could also be convenient for a national hotline to a central point that can access ROSS/IROC and notify the appropriate dispatch center. We also need to empower firefighters to call their dispatch center if this occurs to track down individuals to send the appropriate response.  Dispatch SOPs maybe needed to facilitate a timely/affective tracking and response.<br/><br/><br/>Example:<br/>John gets a text from Billy (assigned to prepo somewhere) about feeling low and nothing to live for.  John could then call up his dispatch or a central line and notify them.  The central line or dispatch would then pull up Billys IROC and know from the resource order, Billy is assigned to region 1 prepo in Missoula.  Dispatch then could call down Missoula dispatch.  Missoula dispatch could then notify the duty officer who would then send themselves or a fellow firefighter to Billys location.  Dispatch would then also notify medics and psychologist.","08/04/2021 15:47"

The incident commander assigned me to this position because he recognizes my certifications, qualifications and experience in Wildland Firefighting and management.<br/><br/>I had firefighters assigned to me engaged in various tactics and had helicopters working near me on the southern edge along the John Wayne trail. About 45 minutes into the incident, while conducting a burnout operation, I witnessed Chief, XXXX XXXXXXX, who was not assigned in a position on the incident, driving well into my division. I walked over to his vehicle and noticed his wife in the vehicle with him. I asked what he needed and was told he wanted to change my tactics on my operation. Having no idea what my plan was, I informed XXXXXX this would not be effective.  We were utilizing both natural fire and burnout operations to let heavy brushy fuels fully consume to limit the amount of time and effort it would take to mop up this part of the fire.  This is a tactic I use often with crews that I am assigned when I am a division supervisor or Task Force leader on fires all over the state.   Just after this distraction, I briefly lost my situational awareness, causing me to be dropped on by a helicopter doing bucket drops next to my location.  This is a big safety issue and could have been prevented. <br/><br/>Having Chief XXXXXXX drive into the incident in his KVFR department vehicle, B-201, on a one way road, also hindered our firefighters secondary egress from the work area. No announcement was made of him accessing our area which meant we didn’t have time to come up with another egress plan.  After I was dropped on, I turned around and walked away to get back to running a division the way I’ve been trained to do.   Shortly after that, I was contacted by the incident commander stating that Chief XXXXXXX was at his location trying again to get me to change my tactics. This prompted a phone call from the Incident Commander to me.  Battalion 71 was the Incident commander and advised me that Chief XXXXXXXX was again asking me to change my tactics. This phone call furthered the distraction XXXXXXXX had created when he drove into the incident.  Ultimately we kept with the well thought out tactics that I was having my crews use, and they were successful.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I feel it is also important to note that I don't believe either people in the KVFR vehicle (Chief XXXXXXX or his Wife) are red-carded, certified wildland firefighters,  adding more of an issue to the safety of the incident.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I write this today after much debate. I travel all over the state doing this line of work for a Type 3 Incident Management team. I also volunteer for Kittitas County Fire District 1 and live within your district borders,(Dist. 7). I enjoy being able to help and by no means do I want that to stop.  Ultimately, we all need to create a safe working environment for everyone on the fire line. In my opinion, Chief XXXXXXX created an unsafe environment and brought a non-firefighter into an evolving incident that had people being evacuated from their homes and the general area due to the threat.  It is not normal practice in Kittitas County, for a Chief to arrive on scene, not become part of the incident officially, drive into it with a civilian in the work truck and try to change the tactics of those actually managing and fighting the fire.  I have no motives here except to point out some safety issues and inconsistency with standard operating procedures for wildland firefighting.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this and feel free to reach out with any questions. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Attached is a photo of the vehicle in the incident.

All resources were on the line and engaged by 0900. I had asked the T2IA crew to post a lookout in a location so that we would have early warning for any adverse fire behavior and to monitor weather conditions. <br/>     Operations continued normally without incident until approximately 1420 I received a radio report from the Lookout stating that a firearm had been discharged at him from a land owner. I advised him to seek retreat and seek safety immediately. Next I called 911, as the location we were in had good cell reception and close to inhabited areas. I informed the dispatcher of who I was, what happened and where the incident happened. The dispatcher said there would be units enroute and I could meet them at Drop Point 1. I radioed the lookout again to check his status and he informed me that he was out of the field of view of the land owner and making his way to a road to be picked up by his crew boss. I then radioed the rest of the taskforce resources to clear the area. <br/>     I met the Lookout and his crewboss at DP 1 and he reported the events to me stating he heard the land owner say “ Unless you’re a firefighter, get off my property.”  Being dressed in full PPE, he walked to the edge of the ridgeline and waved to make his presence known without question. The Look Out then said the land owner went into their house at which point the Lookout considered the matter settled and went about his job of observing the fire. Shortly after the Lookout said he heard a firearm discharged and a bullet strike rocks in his area. At this point he retreated and radioed me about the incident and made his retreat. <br/>   Law Enforcement Officers from multiple jurisdictions including Klamath County Sheriff, Forest Service LEOs and Oregon State Troopers arrived shortly after, where they Interviewed the Lookout and gathered intelligence about where the incident happened and who had perpetrated it. <br/>  They departed DP1 to confront the landowner and were engaged out of my view for approximately 1 1/2 hours. After which time they returned to DP 1 with the results of their confrontation withe the landowner being Cited and released and a .22 caliber rifle being confiscated. They did not remove the landowner from the property nor stay in the area to help ensure firefighter safety though requested to do so for the duration of the shift. <br/>   All resources were pulled from the line where a debrief of what had occurred was conducted. Written statements of the events were documented by myself, Lookout, Crewboss and a water tender driver as he had had a suspicious encounter with another resident of the property that the shooting had occurred from.  All resources were released back to camp by 1930. <br/>  Division Trainee had told me that he had informed the Branch Director of the incident. <br/>   After our debrief I met with the incoming night Division resources, of whom two had heard there had been an incident on the division but not had been informed of what or where in the night Shift briefing.  I proceeded to relay pertinent information and answer questions.  <br/>  I left the line and drove to the Forward Operating Base in Bly, OR where I looked for some sort of safety staff to make sure that this incident had been reported widely for safety. I was unable to locate any Safety Personnel and instead talked with a Logistics Section Chief who garnered the critical information, called someone at ICP and said the matter would be reported through the chain. I departed the Forward Operating Base and made my way to camp outside Bly. <br/>   The next morning this incident garnered a one sentence mention in briefing and incorrectly identified which Division that it had occurred on. I spoke with Division Trainee and inquired if any Law Enforcement would be assigned to help with firefighter safety at which point he said he did not know. Without the LEO presence I stated we would not be conducting any suppression activities in the area of the problem landowner which he concurred with. <br/>  I left camp and proceeded to the Division to meet incoming resources.

Multiple equipment, heavy equipment bosses, and overhead personnel were involved in a 'close call' during indirect line preparation efforts on DIV DD. <br/><br/>At 0600 briefing, there was limited direction given due to night resource transfer of information not being completed yet and the DIV seemed very flustered and sporadic. It was decided for all HEQB's to meet at 28 staging at the DIV DD/CC break to create a plan of action and get appropriate equipment engaged in thinning operations off of the 28 RD as the head of the fire was pushing directly east towards that Division. Once arrived, myself and 3 other HEQB's split up to scout out potential turn arounds and unloading areas for lowboys and equipment, amount of work needed to be accomplished and potential escape routes and safety zones. As we all arrived back in the staging area around 0830, multiple lowboys were passing us and all the equipment operators were gathered up getting briefed form DIV DD and another DIV DD #2 who was also there 'assisting' as another DIV. <br/><br/>We joined in at the tail end of the briefing where all we heard from DIV DD was for the operators to 'Get up the hill, find a wide spot and get to work!' For context we had near 30 lowboys and various equipment in staging in which the 28 RD would not be able to support. Frustrated, we pulled aside DIV DD and reminded him we needed a better plan in place to adequately support the assignment and keep everyone safe. He the responded with, 'I'm just getting a lot of pressure from Ops and we need to get people moving!' and then drove off up the 28 RD. By 1100 we continuously attempted to gain control  back of the operation and communicate safety zones, escape routes and communications with the equipment already involved up the 28 RD and halted anyone else form continuing up the road. Every time we would get equipment in a good spot to continue work safely, DIV DD would interrupt operations to change specs and the overall objective to the point of everyone who were engaged in preparation being extremely confused.<br/><br/>At this time, roughly 1230, fire behavior was beginning to pick up, winds were increasing, and we decided to then again contact DIV DD to try and gain some clarification on the assignment and get more intel on where the fire was and what it was doing in regards to our Division. DIV DD disregarded our concerns, had no intel to give, and said again 'We just need to stay engage, because Operations in pressuring me to get this done.' This was the 4th conversation we had with DIV DD, with valid safety concerns being presented, equipment spread out deeper down the 28 RD than we were comfortable with, and continuous changes in plans with no clear direction given. Fire was quickly approaching (within a mile), fall-out of embers and burning materials were increasing, and the column began to lay directly over the 28 RD.","After the final conversation with DIV DD, at 1300 all 4 HEQB's assigned to the Division requested a conversation with Operations. We voiced our concerns with Operations about the consistent issues we were having with DIV DD. Operations said he would have a conversation with DIV DD and that DIV DD #2 would be our main point of contact for the rest of the day. We agreed as HEQB's that we were comfortable working for DIV DD #2 but not DIV DD and that if DIV DD remained on our DIV we would like to be reassigned. Unfortunately, operations never had a conversation with DIV DD on DIV DD #2 now being the main point of contact and the current situation only got more convoluted. Our final conversation with Operations was that the fire 'was just skunking around and putting up a lot of volume from the heavy fuel loading'.<br/><br/>Due to the chaotic leadership, 'transfer of command' from one DIV to another, fire behavior increasing, and limited to no information on location of the head of the fire we as HEQBs decided to pull all equipment off of the line and proceed to 28 Staging, which was also identified as our safety zone. Now 1430, we had accountability of all equipment that was engaged on the 28 RD, some resources in which we were unaware were even employed on the DIV due to DIV DD spontaneously sending resources in without guidance, communication, or a solid plan of action. DIV DD was obviously irritated in the choice we made to pull everyone off the line again stating his decisions came from 'pressure form Ops.' <br/><br/>Within 45 mins of us pulling resources back into the safety zone, the fire made a 4-5 mile run pushing to the east across the 28 RD directly where all our equipment was engaged. Winds within the safety zone were pushing 50 mph and the activity ahead of us across the 28 RD were extreme. Running crown fires, multiple spots up to 2 miles ahead of the main body of the fire, and gusts up to 80 mph were recorded in that same area as well. We stayed in the safety zone for the rest of the day until it was safe enough for us and the resources to leave the 28 Staging and return to ICP. Our egress was also cut-off and we were forced to take an alternate route back to ICP, which added an additional 1.5 hours to the drive.<br/><br/>Upon arrival back to DIV DD the following day, DIV DD was still employed as our leadership on the division, we again stated that we would not be working for DIV DD and finally the decision was made to move DIV DD #2 onto the division officially and remove DIV DD completely from our operations. As we made our way into the fire area where the main push crossed the 28 RD, it was obvious that the conditions were more than extreme. After getting a FOBS requested into the area, it was determined that a large tornado had occurred and up to 30 acres of trees had been up rooted. Thankfully no one was harmed. After multiple discussions and safety concerns were presented and changes were made we were able to continue to progress in suppression activities safely.","08/04/2021 16:00"

We approached the heel from the right flank, where the fire was backing down the hillside of a plateau in grasses and some occasional chest high bushes.  We began mobile attack and pushed our engine up the slope.  The ground was extremely steep, at the limits of what we could safely maneuver in.  I would estimate 30 percent but could be wrong.

The same thing happened on an additional Ranger District (Holly Springs) on March 28th, and those communications have been down since. All districts continue to engage in prescribed fire operations and the potential for wildfires is also present. With the possibility of storms and tornados in this area, the risks of not having proper communications also effects operations for all hazard incidents, which occur year round. There are many areas in the state where radio communications are the only option due to lack of phone service. Not having a radio tech in state results in a very slow turn around time, which could be detrimental to ground and aerial resources responding to wildfires and all hazard situations.","After the communications went down, a ticket was placed, a WildCAD text message went out to overhead resources, and the radio tech in the neighboring state was informed of the issue. Dispatch had to send Aircraft qualified dispatchers directly to the effected districts to assist with resource tracking and radio communications from handheld radios, with both ground and aviation resources. We do not have additional ACDP qualified dispatchers to assist at our Coordination Center due to this action. A SAFECOM was then submitted due to the aviation risk, and the FAO was informed, as well as the regional Coordination Center Aviation personnel.<br/><br/>Concerns were repeatedly voiced to Forest and Fire overhead from Dispatch, and because of the aviation mishap in the past on one of the districts, concerns were also voiced by fire resources at multiple levels.<br/><br/>Contact was made with the Regional Telecommunications Manager by the Forest FMO to see if we could get this incident remedied more efficiently than waiting for action to happen by other parties before sending a tech to assist us.","04/16/2021 10:28"

Because of the hazardous conditions Dispatch was closed on Monday 15th.  On Tuesday March 16th, 1 dispatcher was able to make it into the office and found all the radio kiosks had a link fail displayed on all radio frequencies.  Per the Radio Tech's it was a security authentication issue that was preventing the machines from getting onto the network properly and it was isolated to the Dell Computers.  The Radio Tech's asked us what brand the 2 COOP Computers were and we advised they were HP's.  The radio tech's asked us to log into them and check to see if we had radio capabilities.  This option did provide some radio communications capabilities but it significantly decreased the quality of the communications and it dropped the number of dispatch consoles from 6 to 2.  Due to the Blizzard the number of regular personnel in the field  decreased by 3/4 compared to the previous week's 5 RX burns, 35+ personnel in the field throughout the Zone.   <br/><br/>This is the second time that the Radio Kiosk's have been kicked off the network, We were told the first time in September that moving the Dispatch Radio Kiosk's to the Radio Kiosk profiles would place them in a special group and this issue would not happen in the future.  This second time we were able to effectively mitigate because of the winter season and the unusual weather but an issue like this a third time during a busy fire season would significantly decrease our capabilities for our Dispatch Operations and decrease the ability to support the field effectively.   <br/><br/>It is unclear the Date and time when these Security patches are automatically pushed because of this if we come into dispatch and the consoles are logged off it causes a delay in our start time by 10-15 min because of logging in and opening up the radio programs.  10-15 min doesn't sound like alot of time usually but when we have field personnel moving through the zone, we need to be able to communicate with them in case of an emergency.","Dispatch called Duty Officer's to advise of radio issues and delay in Dispatch start.  <br/><br/>Dispatch called the Radio Tech's to advise of the Radio Kiosk issues.  They asked about the COOP computers and determined we could log onto them.  We then did a radio check with the Duty Officer to make sure the Coop computers were working properly.  <br/><br/>The Coop Computers worked but the incoming traffic was extremely low volume.  We found some external speakers and turned the volume up to 100 on the computers.  That helped a little bit but it was still quiet so the dispatcher if he/she stepped away would have to playback the callback traffic to make sure they didn't miss any traffic.  <br/><br/>The Radio techs put in a helpdesk ticket on Tuesday morning.  On Thursday The radio techs found out that not only did the Radio Kiosk get kicked off the network but on Wednesday along with 1100 other PC's they were also removed from the Active Directory because they were determined to be stale. This was done under a Change Management Release (RLSE0014037).  After this issue was discovered the issue was escalated and the removal of the Dispatch Kiosk's was reversed.  <br/><br/>On Friday morning the Radio Tech's installed manual updates and patches and rebooted the computers completely to make the kiosks were operational again.","04/02/2021 13:16"

It made me mad to hear this as i was unable to hear any transmissions from this fire that was going on. This isn't an isolated event. It happens every day we have a new start.

The following crews are sponsored by the BIA, Fort Apache Agency, in Whiteriver, AZ.

On November 4, 2004, the Fort Apache Agency had one Type 2 crew return to Whiteriver, AZ at 0325 hours.  On November 5, 2004, the Fort Apache Agency had four Type 2 crews return to Whiteriver, AZ at 0411 hours.  

The Fort Apache Agency’s warehouse foreman and dispatcher stated that the bus drivers transporting this group of firefighters from Phoenix, AZ showed visible fatigue characteristics.  Fort Apache Agency stated that their personnel were told that the above crews would arrive prior to 10 PM each evening.  The crews were delayed for several hours upon their arrival into Phoenix, AZ.  However, these crews were not lodged in Phoenix, AZ even though they arrived into Phoenix, AZ after 10 PM.  The Fort Apache Agency staff ends up working more than 16 hours because of these delays.  Personnel at Fort Apache Agency are woken at 3 AM in order to properly check-in their Type 2 crews.  These early arrival time periods require families, relatives, etc. to arrive and pick-up their family members during these early time periods.  The likelihood for a vehicle accident to occur is increased due to their driving during these early morning periods.  The Fort Apache Agency has several crewmembers that live at least 50+ miles from Whiteriver, AZ.","These crews needed to arrive at their home unit base prior to 2200 hours or have them RON at a designated staging area and/or motel.

Staging Centers or Mob Centers need to RON crews that arrive at jet airports late and will not allow crews to arrive at their home bases before 10 PM.    I am trying to resolve this problem by filing this SAFENET action.  Upon reviewing and updating our SWA Mob Guide, I will suggest to the SWA Coordinating Group that demobing of resources not allow for crews to arrive at their home units after 10 PM and before 6 AM.","12/11/2003 00:00"

I had reported this the previous week and had checked the Catalyst system that morning when I logged on my computer.  The front desk called my telephone to see if I had heard the call on the radio.  At that time, they reported it was a wildfire, gave the location of it and approximate acres.  I heard this from the front desk telephone conversation.  This transmission still did not come through my radio (Midland).  I tried calling two of our employees several times, they were not hearing me but the front desk could.  I went next door on that radio & gained radio communication.  After I got the necessary information & started dispatching resources, I came back over to the dispatch office & turned the Midland off/on and then tried calling the field.  At that time, they did hear me.  The radio communications continued to be marginal during this fire and the one following it.  Both of these fires were a short distance from the Salem Office (approximately 10 miles).  I feel the radio communication needs improvement.

The quality of the radio transmission has been poor and unreadable at times and there are times when repeaters on our Fire Management Zone are not accessible through this system.  Within the last month, we have changed buildings and moved the backup base station radio (Midland) to our new building.  This system is not working properly either and on 11/03/03, during initial attack of two fires on our district, the quality of the backup system was such that we could not understand the dispatcher nor could she receive our transmissions.  'Catalyst' was not available on this date because of problems with the server.  The concern is that these fires were within 10 miles of the dispatch office and we were not able to receive instructions or transmit messages to our dispatcher.  The Fire Management Zone that this dispatch office is covering constitutes a wide geographic area with multiple repeaters.  Major safety concerns are evident when communications are poor.  We now have two unreliable radio systems, one that is dependent on a server that is not always available or operational.

Make sure you've got enough resources to do the job.  If not, back off and come up with another plan.

As fireline supervisors, make sure you look at the whole picture, be ready to change your plan as conditions change.

Adhere to work rest guidelines    An AAR was conducted with the Type 2 Interagency hand crew.  Some of the things that were identified are:

Maintaining good communication with crew, supervisor, and adjoining forces.

Not getting bogged down with the initial plan, being flexible, changing plan as conditions change.

Maintaining control at all times, understanding the 'human factor'.

The Engine was placed in a staging area and within 15 mobilized to a division assignment located on HWY 18, east of Rim of the World High School.  At the time of this assignment, the crew had not received a briefing, shift plan, or other information concerning their assignment.  They were totally unaware of the strategy and tactics being implemented on this fire, what their assignment was, who their supervisor was and how to contact that person.

The engine 'fell in line' with a group of engines that appeared to be assigned to holding for a major backfire operation along HWY 18.  This backfiring operation was already in progress when the engine arrived.

By 1200, the backfire had begun to compromise the highway when a crown fire in mature pine crossed in front of the engine.  Crews and engines were mobilized to contain this slop over.

Around 1300, backfiring operations resumed.  The engine continued to work until 0300 on October 29th when the backfiring operation ultimately failed.  During the time they were assigned, communications, chain of command, and clear instructions concerning the assignment were never provided.

At 0300, the engine was moved to a safety zone.  At 0530, the engine was remobilized to staging area closer to the aforementioned backfiring operation.  At 1000, the engine was released from staging back to camp, where they attempted to check-in, since they were directly assigned to the fire upon arrival.

Confusion occurred between the fire and the local district as to where the engine was supposed to report. After several hours, the engine was assigned to the local district for IA.  They finally went off the clock at 1500, although that was not the direction of the Forest.  The Engine Boss unilaterally decided to go off the clock.  No meals or lodging were provided by the government.

The following safety violations occurred.

1) Engine was never briefed on assignments, strategies, tactics, fire behavior, fire weather, or any other incident information.

2) Communications with the supervisor were never established and the supervisor was never identified.

3) The number of engines, tenders, emergency vehicles and media traffic along HWY 18 compromised the engines only escape route back to the safety zone.  Observed and predicted fire behavior indicated that there was a high potential for entrapment along that road.  If this had occurred, incident resources would have been stranded in a traffic quagmire.

4) Safety zone was too small to accommodate the number of vehicles and personnel assigned, should they have had to use it.

5) Engine crews were assigned to a 33-hour shift.  This fire was clearly not in the initial attack phase.  Shift length guidelines were not adhered to.","It is painfully clear to me, as the supervisor of this engine crew, that incident management on this fire was completely focused on this backfire operation as a last ditch effort to save a large residential area.  In their zeal to accomplish this mission, they were willing to violate at least 3 of the 4 LCES standards, and a majority of the 10 Standard Fire Orders. Nearly all the watch-out situations were apparent on scene and many of the recent Thirtymile action items were totally ignored.

Based on personal experience, and after lengthy discussions with others who have experienced fires in southern California, the general feeling is 'well that's how they do it out there'.

Therefore, if that's how they do it out there, my corrective action is to not send any more of my personnel into that situation.

The problems exhibited in this situation appear to be widespread and accepted by the agencies involved.

I would recommend that this fire be reviewed.  I suspect that review will reveal an attitude, which appears to me to place the value of residential areas above the safety of the fire fighters.","11/07/2003 00:00"

The following safety concerns were observed.

1. There was a definite lack of a command structure; I.C., chain of command, etc.

2. There was no list of resources on scene, or location of the same.

3. There were no established radio frequencies, or knowledge of those being used by interacting resources.

4. Mutually exclusive or opposed tactics were in use by different resources.

5. Majority of resources on scene were unschooled on tactics, and pump use (their own).

6. In the two days we worked this fire, briefings were non-existent.

7. Extreme fire behavior and wind events were common, but unmonitored.

8. There was a common lack of PPE.

9. There was no LCES implementation on the part of the overhead.

The results of the combination of the above activity was a near burn over hand crews working this fire. Crews were working inside the established dozer line in an attempt to cut off an unburned corner. Dozer line had been punched in from either end, and the crews were attempting to connect the ends with hand line (approximately 1 1/2 miles). To begin with, hand line was not an effective measure against this fire. Wind, and the fact that it was largely running in the crowns, negated the effect. Our engine was on the windward side, and we observed the fire making a significant run, backed by substantial wind in the direction of the working crews. Overhead, such as we knew it, was notified; but took almost fourteen minutes to find a method and/or frequency to notify the endangered crews. They ended up having to burn out around their vehicles, and retreating to some dirty black that had good potential for reburn.","Fire education    Our engine attempted to contact the crews directly. When this proved to be impossible due to the aforementioned reasons, overhead was notified.

On numerous occasions we attempted to discuss the implementation of tactics. We asked about briefings, and were told about meals. In addition, one was never sure of whether one was talking to somebody that was actually in charge or not.","10/15/2003 00:00"

'Prescribed Fire' on 09/28/03, at approximately 1430 I tied in with the assigned IC and a few crew members at base camp 2. After a short discussion, I learned that objectives were not being met due to several spot fires over the containment lines (this is the same story I heard on the previous day's delivery and in spite of the fact that some resources had worked a 24hr shift that had ended the morning of the 28th.) I was told to continue up the Charley Red foot road to the North perimeter and drop the supplies at the first Fold-a-tank. It was during this trip that I noticed some things that concerned me: 1) The east flank which was in a drainage that ran north-south had a good sized smoke column boiling out of it, this did not appear to be anchored or contained and definitely was un-manned at that time (later that afternoon in my efforts to gather an employee I discovered that the N.W. corner was the same as above, I arrived just as the two person engine crew was evacuating that portion of line due to extreme fire behavior). 2) One hand crew and three type-6 engines were working spot fires that had crossed the Charley Red foot road to the north the fuels in this area were dense re-prod Fir which could distort a persons view of the big picture (this area is above and slightly west of the increased activity on the east flank.) Although the south side of the road had been burned out some areas had burned real dirty, leaving plenty of unburned fuel (solid stands of conifer trees) between the east flank activity and the crews working above. 3) Escape routes, not being present at briefing I am unaware of planned escape routes and safety zones so this next statement is an assumption based on what I saw. Charley Red foot road is essentially a one-lane mountain road with multiple switchbacks and very few turnouts. The hand crew was working a spot on the NE corner of the fire, three Type-6 engines were running hose lays on the north side of the road approximately 1/4 mile west of the hand crew (the most obvious safe zone I saw was approximately 1 mile west of the nearest crews). The hand crew was at the top of the drainage that contained the east flank activity, with no obvious safe zone in the immediate area. The engines were parked in opposing directions with at least one of them having their hard line fully extended. These actions hint of an inefficient escape plan. After further consultation with personnel on scene and a failed effort to obtain a copy of the burn plan (the IC/person in charge stated that he was not issued a burn plan upon assignment) I decided to pull the BLM resources based on the following (this action was supported by my FMO and agreed to by the USFS, FMO via cell phone calls made between 1600 and 1630.) Safety - Improper risk assessment/situational awareness, lack of documentation (burn plan), failure to adjust strategies and tactics (majority of the work completed on the 26th -28th was lost due to uncontrollable fire.)

At 1750, the engine captain called engine module 'on scene' to local dispatch.  The engine captain then checked in with the IC for an assignment.  The engine was assigned to Division Bravo, where it would do a mobile attack on the fire.  The engine anchored into the fire and engaged suppression.  As the module tied the fire into a dry creek bed, just below the engine active fire was observed on either side of the creek bed.  The engine captain saw a CDF engine down in the creek bed, so the operator committed the engine into that area.  Shortly after, the engine became stuck in sand.  A dozer being used to build line was brought up to assist in pulling out the engine.  He pulled the engine about fifty feet, thinking the engine was on solid ground.  The dozer then went back to building line.  After trying to maneuver around the sand, the truck became stuck again. The engine captain radioed Division Bravo to have the dozer come back to their location.  The engine's crew rehooked the chain the exact same way as before; the front of the chain to a solid metal area on the back of the dozer, to the right front frame hook (passenger side) on the engine.  Just before the dozer was about to pull the engine out, one of the crew members on the ground got into the passenger seat of the engine.  As the dozer started to pull, tension was put on the chain, snapping it near the dozer, sending it whipping back at the engine. The chain came over the hood and across the windshield, shattering the windshield. The chain did not penetrate the window, but did send fragments of glass into the cab and onto the passenger.  Fortunately, there were no injuries to either the operator or crewmember in the engine.","As the engine did in this situation:  Hook the chain up to the passenger side frame hook.  If the chain breaks, it will send it away from the operator.

Never have anyone else in the engine that doesn't need to be.

Ensure that the operators of both pieces of equipment are involved in connecting equipment.  The operators hook up their own apparatus.

Have additional personnel stand out of the way of equipment; at least 100 feet away from them.  (Let the operators handle the situation.)

Place sleeping bag, brush coat, etc. over the tow chain to absorb backlash of chain.    Everything that is listed above is corrective action for this problem.","09/20/2003 00:00"

I am referring to the use of marijuana by key overhead positions. They use it openly in the community and with greener employees (a wonderful example) on a regular basis. I have never once heard of them being randomly drug tested, as the seasonal employees are (most of the seasonals are too scared of losing their jobs to come up with drugs in their systems, but they are the ones being tested). Why aren't FMO's, Fuels Specialists and the like also given drug tests?

Although not a standard spot request, the office has always performed exceptionally well and provided excellent service in providing these.

Before briefing on 9/13 at 0730 the spot had not arrived. After going to the NWS website, contact at the phone number listed was attempted. This resulted in reaching the weekend message for the office.

Around 9:00 a watchful fire WX forecaster noticed the over site and went after the spot.

At 9:21 the spot was completed and received by the incident.

The issues are :

1) Ease of communication between end users and the NWS.

2) Communication between shifts of the NWS.","Issue 1) It’s understandable that the NWS does not want to publish phone #'s on the Internet. This is in an attempt to prevent every person out there from calling them over trivial matters. This position is completely understandable.

Unfortunately, the number listed as a contact on the web site should be just that, a contact number, not a recording. Not all end users have the direct phone line numbers handy, but they usually have an Internet connection. This was only slightly frustrating, and could have been easily corrected by the incident by calling around for the NWS direct phone number.

The night/swing forecaster made an excellent recommendation / point. In the spot page there is a secure portion (the maps). These can only be seen by other agencies with authorized IP addresses (?). This could potentially include the local NWS direct phone #. As a potential corrective action this is outstanding (why didn't we think of this before).

Issue 2)

The swing/night shift forecaster noticed the spot was for 0730 (at 1730) and intended to brief the fire WX forecaster on it in the am.

This did not occur.

At 0900 the day fire WX forecaster noticed the spot and took immediate action. (Thanks)

As a corrective action, a standard between shift briefings should occur. (This is probably the case). If we need a big task board to remind us, then that could be a possible solution. And sometimes we just forget to pass information along (South Canyon).    Spoke with the NWS. The above measures could prevent this in the future.

This is a great office with competent, concerned forecasters. Their products have been great, and it is always a pleasure to work with them.

This Safenet has been filed because of the potential to miss another one.

We are sure these issues have been or will be resolved.","09/13/2003 00:00"

Area Command was helpful in getting us what we needed.  HECMs did not seem to be a major problem to find.  Our philosophy was to limit these resources to their 14 days and then release them whenever possible.  We tried, whenever possible, to avoid extensions.  On 9-7-03, we received 2 HECMs to support our helicopters assigned to us.  Later on, we received the Tool Kit Addition documenting the extensions (5 day) for these two HECMs.  Here are the issues I have with these particular extensions:

1) These folks were extended for their previous incident, not ours, without consulting with us first.  Demob was taking 3-5 days to get folks out and they arrived on day 13.

2) Part IV of their extension was ridiculous.  Their Risk Assessment Process stated 'No risk, Helicopter Crewmembers.'  Mitigation of Risks stated 'Change of assignment to new fire.'

The worst part about this issue was that the GACC Manager, Section Chief, Safety Officer, and Type II IC all signed and approved this extension.

I feel we need to set the number of days a person is available and leave it at that.  I know costs come into play but this could lead to possibly posing a serious threat to someone's well being.  I've always found it interesting that we can control how much a pilot works but we can't do it with our own folks.    I reported this incident to my IC.

Incident Number: P14466 / Q456

On September 05, 2003 our crew was assigned to Division I. We were to hike in 2 hours from our drop off point at the end of Division B to the end of an indirect fire line in Division I, and begin line construction towards Division G.

Terrain was extremely steep with slopes of 70 percent and fuels were closed canopy timber with heavy understory. The area was under a weather inversion. Visibility was poor due to the inversion. At times though we could see trees torching below us. The indirect line path we were hiking on was very steep. The main fire was below and to the east of our location. The further the crew hiked in took us away from the safety zone at the dam and away from any secured line below us. At no time were we informed of any other safety zones, but escape routes were flagged.

After hiking for approximately 1 hour, the crew stopped for lunch at around 1300. The lunch spot was approximately 50 feet from the flagged escape route, which lead down towards the fire in a creek bottom. From that advantage point we saw more torching down below us. The inversion was starting to lift increasing visibility. We noted more active fire behavior and torching of small groups of trees below our location.

The crew began to review LCES, 10/18 and evaluate the fire situation. The crew boss noted that there were no safety zones and the escape route was inadequate because it did not lead to any safety zone. Crew boss contacted the Strike Team Leader with concerns and they set up a face-to-face meeting. No mitigation measures could be agreed upon. The crew suggested building safe zones as they build line, but that option was turned down due to bear habitat. The crew at that point turned down the assignment before they hiked any further into the original fire assignment location. The turn down took place at approximately 1330.

Strike Team Leader called Division and the crew was given another assignment. Crew hiked down the slope to Division B. They were given an assignment there for the rest of the shift.

On September 07, the crew was notified that they would be assigned once again to Division I to complete the original task of indirect fireline construction, the next day. No mitigation had been completed. There were still no safety zones. The crew would not work in the area without adequate safety zones or mitigation measures. Crew was demobed on September 08th.","Allowing the crew to build safety zones as they constructed line would have been an acceptable mitigation measure. Operations could look at change in tactics and relocate indirect line to the ridge top using existing trails.    Crew recommended that they be allowed to construct safety zones as they built line. This was turned down. The crew utilized turn down procedure and protocol.","09/10/2003 00:00"

My understanding is that these radios are new and are in trial status. We used the radios on fire assignments during this fire season and found several problems with them. Two problems that are real safety issues are:

1) The radio goes through batteries very quickly, especially when the radio is set on high. When it is set on low, you cannot receive in-coming calls very well.

2) When you transmit and have to relay a message that last for several seconds, the radio starts beeping then shuts off and you have to wait a while before you can turn it back on. I feel that it is a real safety hazard if you can't communicate with personnel during extreme fire conditions or to pass on information that relates to fire.

These are just a few things that we found that we feel need immediate attention. Until these problems are corrected, we will switch back using the Bendix-King radios and store our Racal radios.

During his check-in interview, the Status/Check-In Recorders requested to see his current Incident Qualifications Card. (Gentleman x) said that he did not have it with him and it was on his desk at his home unit. They then asked if he had completed the Standards For Survival annual training this year. He replied that he understood that the SEC2 position did not require having Standards For Survival.

Resource Unit Leader trainee (RUL trainee), with the Bennett Type 1 IMT asked (Gentleman x) for his home dispatch center's telephone number so his qualifications could be checked and faxed to the incident. (Gentleman x) verified that he had not had the annual refresher training, but was a fully qualified SEC2 as shown on a 2002 Incident Qualifications Card. (Gentleman x) said he had not been issued an Incident Qualifications Card for 2003.

(Gentleman x)  also told RUL trainee and the Time Unit Leader that he had been dispatched twice before this season, but those dispatches had been cancelled by the incidents before he left his home unit. On this third dispatch, he actually left the home unit and made it to the Mineral-Primm ICP.

RUL trainee called the Klamath Dispatch Center at 530/841-4600 and talked with the dispatch supervisor. The Center verified that (Gentleman x) was qualified as a SEC2, but had not been issued an Incident Qualifications Card because their records showed that he had not taken Standards For Survival this year. They requested that we send (Gentleman x) back to California.  (Gentleman x) had spent two (2) days in travel status driving from Fort Jones, CA to Potomac, MT and will need to spend another two (2) days in return travel, including time over a federal holiday.

Due to this occurring during a transfer of command period, RUL trainee consulted Demob Unit Leader, from the  Type 2 IMT. Both team Plans Section Chiefs concurred that (Gentleman x) would be declined from the incident and returned to his home unit.","Home units need to verify that all resources listed as available to dispatch have current agency required training and qualifications and are able to accept the assignment.

At that time, our crew was informed that there would be no safety zones or escape routes. In the event that we had to bug out, we would have to hike down a one half mile of uneven, rocky dozer line to our buggies. Once we reached our buggies there was a two to three mile drive to an open gravel road. At no time was there a safe place to be in the event of a blow up. This continued for several days. The fire behavior in this area was erratic and extreme, with torching and spotting. Once we reached the fire perimeter we then started direct line. At that time, fire was above and below us with multiple spot fires. Once again there were no safety zones or escape routes established or identified. Our Crew Boss left his trainee with us most of the time. The Crew Boss made little effort in joining us in operations. Several times the Crew Boss Trainee had questions and would have to call the Crew Boss on the radio. I felt unsure about this and was concerned about the safety of our crew as well as myself.","I believe that a trainee should be supported by his instructor at all times. I think that all the poor decision-making, and the apparent lack of fire knowledge could have been prevented had the instructor (Crew Boss) been present.

The Crew Boss Trainee should have asked the Crew Boss to assist him personally instead of trying to take this all on himself.

1- Transition attempt before incoming DIVGS was comfortable

2 - Transition attempt during disengagement

3 - Leaving Fire and ICP before resources were off line.

On 8/26/03 during the first full briefing of our team the IC said, 'This is the longest transition in history - 3-5 days.'  Although the operational line personnel had only been in camp 12 hours.  This set the precedence for the events of the day.  During the morning briefing personnel were told that the transition was to take place at the end of the operational period.  At 1500 the out going DIVS told the incoming DIVS that he was leaving the fire because he had 4 hours of travel to do.  The incoming DIVS told me this and said he was not comfortable with the division yet and be able to transfer command. I said okay, tell the outgoing DIVS to stay until the end of the shift.

At 1700 another attempt was made to force a transfer of command, our answer was still no.  At approximately, 1710 disengagement was started by the outgoing DIVS. Air attack was brought over and said there was nothing to start a total disengagement from and the crews had solid black on both sides of them.  The outgoing DIVS told air attack he was disengaging so he could get crews to the bottom.  At this time I was up at the top of the division driving the line and found no reason to disengage.  Air attack stated that there were little smokes in the division and adjoining divisions, but nothing to disengage from.  The outgoing DIVS told air attack that he was disengaging because it took the buses too long to get to the bottom so he wanted to start them now.

At 1745, during the disengagement, the outgoing DIVS called the incoming DIVS and wanted to transfer command because the resources were at the bottom of the hill. He was told that a transfer of command would not take place while disengagement was going on.

At 1900 the outgoing DIVS told the incoming DIVS that he was holding a debriefing at DP150 for all his personnel.  The incoming DIVS was present.  Not all personnel from the division were off the line.  The incoming DIVS asked the outgoing DIVS if he was going to debrief those personnel.  He said they can call him when they get to camp.  At 1920 the outgoing DIVS left the fire line and DP150 for ICP.

At 2030, several of the personnel that were left on the line in this division were attempting to contact the outgoing DIVS.  At 2035, the incoming DIVS contacted me about this situation, I told him to round up the IHC and 2 doz operators and 1 DOZB and head them into camp.  At 2045 I arrived in ICP to track down the outgoing DIVS, but was told he already left camp.

My personal ethics prohibit any of the aforementioned transgressions to take place on my branch or fire. I feel that the early attempt to transfer command was to quicken these individuals demob.  I feel the disengagement was an act also to quicken this demob.  But the worst thing for line overhead to do is leave personnel on the line and then leave camp for his personal benefit.  You never ever leave firefighters out on the line, unless it is a planned event.  I also know that this individual could not have done this without the help of his overhead staff.","","08/27/2003 00:00"

On 8/25/03, a helicopter support contractor filled an order under agreement for a crash-rescue engine for the Mineral-Primm incident through the Willamette NF.  Upon arrival at the incident, check-in recorded a Type 3, 1979 Ford Rescue Engine with two operators at 1435 hours on 8/26/03.  The departure time from Albany, OR was 1730 on 8/25/03. Travel time en route to the incident was 21.0 hours without a break.

I asked one the operators if he possessed an inter-state CDL and he said no because the vehicle weight did not require a CDL driver.  The CDL licensing process educates the driver of DOT regulations (10 hr driving within a 15 hour duty day), which is also agency policy.

I provided direction to the operator on the DOT/Agency policy, and also had a discussion of recent fatal vehicle accidents that involved contract fire resources traveling to and from an incident.  I asked him not to feel pressure from the incident, sending unit, or his boss to violate driving policy and consider his safety and the safety of his crew when operating his engine.","08/27/2003 00:00"

The area was extremely rocky (large granite glacial breakup) and the fire was near the ridge top.  Snags were in the fire area.  Down canyon 6miles was urban interface.  The decision was made to staff the fire with an ICT3 + 15, as it appeared to be okay from the air and water for small pumps on sight.

The personnel were helicoptered in while fire behavior was moderate.

Personnel included another ICT3 and ICT4 in addition to IC. Once on site, the three IC qualified personnel did a risk analysis.  The decision was made at that time to turn down the assignment and disengage, reason being that the area was boulder rubble with flat rocks that could slide and snags were abundant.  Potential for fire to escape the canyon was minimal short of a major wind event.  The water that appeared to be available, viewed from the air, was a trickle.

Communications up to that point were on forest net.  When the turndown was announced, the DO and AFMO asked the IC to switch to TAC2.  On TAC2 the DO and AFMO tried to convince the IC to remain on the incident.  To his credit the IC refused and they were extracted by helo.

A decision was then made by the AFMO to staff the fire with 2 people to 'monitor' the fire and would rotate people in every two days.  Eventually an ICT5 and a FFT2 were selected.  Initial instructions were to stay out of fire area and call for bucket work as needed.  However, the day prior to the accident they were asked to scout the down canyon perimeter for potential retardant line and mop-up.  The following day 8/20, the FFT2 headed back down to check fire.  The events that followed are unclear to him, but he sustained a serious injury to his vertebrae and needed to be life-flighted out.

There is no record of a complexity analysis or risk analysis being done after transitions.

From 8/12/2003 until 9/01/2003 this fire burned 40acres of rock, duff and sub-alpine fir.","A)  Listen to and validate the decisions being made by the people on the ground.

The operator suffered minor injuries, was treated, and release at the scene.  The Iron County Sheriffs Office, and the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands investigated the incident.

At approximately 1100 hours on Monday, August 18, the Southwest Area Office, Utah Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands was notified of a smoke report in the Pinto Springs area.  The Iron County Fire Warden responded to the incident, and requested the Newcastle Fire Department also respond.

Newcastle Fire Department responded with a Type 6-engine, a support trailer, and the Type 5-engine.  The Type 6 engine and trailer responded first, and the Type 5 approximately 20 minutes later.  The driver left the station and was traveling south on Main Street.  As he approached the intersection of Center and 200 south (West Pinto Rd.) he began to downshift the vehicle in order to make a 90 degree corner to the east.  During the attempt to downshift the driver lost control of the vehicle which then proceeded to roll over 360 degrees, landing up right on 200 south, 75 feet east of the intersection facing north.  The driver was able to self extricate himself from the vehicle and local fire department personnel treated him on the scene.  The driver reported at the time of incident he estimated his speed at 25-30 mph.  The driver felt that the tank had separated from the bed prior to the event, that caused the vehicle to shift and tip to the right.","The use of all-thread type bolts should be re-evaluated.  These types of bolts are not made of harden material and will routinely fail under minimal stress.  The harden bolts, which attached the bed of the truck to the frame, bent but did not fail.

During a rollover type incident these items, which may be located in the cab of the vehicle, will become projectiles that could cause further harm.  External pumps need to be adequately secured to ensure they will not break free during accidents.  Follow manufacturers recommendations when installing pumps.  Vehicle maintenance checks should be routinely performed and recorded to ensure safe equipment operation.  Routinely check all mounting brackets and bolts for tightness and cracks.  Replace bolts that show any signs of weakness.  Ensure that all vehicles have properly working seat belts, and that drivers wear seat belts at all times.  Implement a drivers education program, and make sure all operators are proficient in operating all equipment.    This incident was thoroughly investigated by numerous agencies.

While en route to the above incident, traveling through Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana on Aug. 17-18, the engine boss placed repeated cell phone calls (dialing out and conversing) while driving at speeds of up to 80 mph (on I-25).  In one of many such incidents, we left a Target store parking lot in Billings on the morning of Aug. 18th, pulling onto US Hwy 87 in heavy traffic while the engine boss was conversing on the cell phone. Though we had been in the store for ten minutes and on the parking lot for another five minutes after leaving the store, he dialed as we drove away and conversed while driving in traffic.  As we turned at a busy Hwy 87 intersection to return to I-90, the engine boss shifted the manual transmission with his right hand, held the phone to his ear with his left hand, and steered through the 90-degree left turn with his left elbow!

Reckless driving habits:

Though he repeatedly told us that he had only two hours of sleep the night before, the engine boss insisted on driving until we reached a motel in Sheridan at 10:30 PM (we started out at about noon that same day). We had agreed earlier that someone else would take over driving in the evening, but the engine boss would not relinquish the wheel.  On that same evening (Aug. 17) north of Casper, Wyoming, we drove through an exceptionally large thunderstorm (and its wet highway footprint) for about two hours.  The engine boss refused to slow down when requested, even in the heaviest rain, expressing a concern that we would not make check-in on time.  When the driver's side wiper blade malfunctioned during a particularly heavy downpour, the engine boss rolled down his window at least twice, reached out and adjusted the wiper, all with driving at 75-80 mph on a rutted interstate (I-25) awash with rain.

Absent equipment:

Concerned about the vehicle, I attempted to check tire pressures the next day and found that there was no tire pressure gauge on board.  The engine boss purchased one at the Target store stop in Billings.  The all-plastic tire pressure gauge proved worthless, measuring up to 50 psi while the tires held 65 psi. No proper tire gauge was procured.

Dangerous operation of vehicle:

Though we were instructed that someone would have to spot for the driver 'every time' the engine was moving in reverse, the engine boss was so inconsistent in practice that we (the third firefighter and I) were left to guess whether the engine boss wanted us to exit the vehicle to spot for him 'this time.'  Several times while on the fire (navigating a narrow dozer line in heavy timber) one of us would start to open the door to exit when the engine boss hastily put it into reverse and backed without guidance.  Fortunately, I had not yet stepped out of the vehicle on these occasions, as this could have resulted in a serious accident while backing and turning.","Are check-in times realistic?  Should responders be specifically instructed not to exceed safe speeds even at the risk of a late check-in?

Contractors are specifically precluded from 'Using a two-way radio or cellular telephone' while driving (RFP 49-02-04 & RFP 49-02-05).  Perhaps cooperators should be held to the same standard with ALL personnel so instructed?

Are tire pressure gauges part of the required complement of equipment on an engine? If not, perhaps they should be.

I don't honestly know what you can do about sleep requirements prior to dispatch, but in this instance it was simply prudent judgment that was lacking.    I suggested that the engine boss slow down, and when he did not respond, I tried talking about how some check-in times were unrealistic, hoping he would get the added hint.  All to no avail.  The other firefighter (crew of three) and I offered to drive late in the day but the engine boss refused the offers.  We tried to gauge the mood of the engine boss when it came to spotting for him while the engine reversed.  If we guessed wrong, he would snap at us to get out and spot for him.  If we guessed correctly, all was peaceful. We did not complain about this problem or others because of the steadily increasing truculence of the engine boss and our sincere wish to maintain a peaceful working relationship.","12/03/2003 00:00"

On 8/12/03 Type 2 Crew came into expanded dispatch to check-in at 1600.  With check-in I asked the CREP and CRWB how long they had been on.  They both responded that they were fresh and had just come from Boise.  They said the driver had 2.5 hours left to drive for the day.  We tooled them and sent them to dinner at 1700.  They left Jackson enroute to the fire at 1900 after I asked them to go several times.  They arrived at the fire at 1900.  Per the IC, they told him that they were fresh and they could go on the night shift at that time.

On 8/13/03, I received the first of the CTR's for the crew that were brought in from the Lloyd Fire.

After seeing the 8/11-8/12 CTR (while in travel status) I realized that they had greatly exceeded hours 8/11 – 1700-2400, 8/12 – 0001-1800, 1830-2130) and thought it was maybe a mistake on the CTR so I contacted the IC who had signed it for clarification.  He expressed not noticing the exceeding hours and had me speak with the CREP.  I had asked him and at that time he said they were rushed through mobilization and never got any kind of break until we rushed them through dinner that second night.  I referenced work/rest and what exactly happened and got several different stories.  I still don't know when they got into Boise from Albuquerque and, according to the CREP, they never received any meals or breaks and it took 14 hours to get to Jackson from Boise.

I spoke with the Bus Driver from Bachman Bus Lines and asked him of the time frames and he gave me a copy of his DOT records.  The daily log shows them leaving Boise at 0700 and getting to Jackson at 1600. He also said they received 2 sack lunches in Boise.

I spoke of my concern with the Regional Office and they suggested I just post time they were on the fire not to include the travel time.  When they checked out this morning they expressed that maybe they took some breaks and would be willing to take 30 minutes of the 26-hour shift.  They also expressed that they tried to tell people in Boise that they had been on since the day before but Boise people said they didn't care and to get going.  I gave them a copy of the work/rest guidelines and what SAFENETS are if they were refused to be able to bed down and that process.  I also told them that when they arrived in Jackson, they had the opportunity to express exceeding hours to me but chose not too.

I forwarded a documentation package to the Regional Office to include copies of the CTR, DOT record for the Bus Lines, and copies of the OF-288's as they currently are (no travel time).","Being the TIME on multiple fires, the only thing I could think was to ask for the CTR's when they arrived to check-in as asking how long they were on and them telling me just came from Boise and they were fresh.  I assumed a 6-hour drive and would have never let them continue on to the fire.  I do feel the responsibility in this case fell on the CREP and the CRWB.","08/22/2003 00:00"

Following established protocols, they checked in with dispatch prior to leaving the station. In addition, they checked in with dispatch periodically while attempting to locate the smoke. The entire time, while searching for the smoke, engine 663 had a difficult time contacting the dispatch center. The engine personnel would call and the dispatch center would not reply.

Later that evening, the District Duty Officer was monitoring radio traffic and noted several attempts by the engine personnel to contact the dispatch center. All attempts to contact the center received no response. Twice that evening, the Duty Officer was forced to contact the dispatch center by phone and inform them that engine 663 was attempting to contact them. In both instances, after the phone calls were made, dispatch responded to the engine personnel by radio (Note: radio communications were possible).

Later in the shift, the engine personnel were attempting to contact dispatch to inform them they were heading back to station. After numerous attempts with no response, the engine came into cell coverage. At that time the Engine Foreman contacted dispatch by cell phone and conveyed the fact that they had been attempting to contact them by radio with no success. The night dispatcher’s response to this was that another dispatcher had muted the radio.

Upon returning to station, and following established protocols, engine 663 personnel called dispatch to check in. The acting Center Manager responded on the radio and said something to the effect that I didn’t know you were working - I thought engine 663 was out of service. This statement was made after engine 663 had been out for over three hours attempting to locate a fire.

The situation described above presents a potentially dangerous and unsafe condition. Not only were communications compromised by personnel in the dispatch center by muting the radio but the center apparently failed to track a resource that was out searching for a fire. In the event of an extreme emergency, the engine crew would have been in a remote location without adequate communications.","Closer monitoring of communications and better of resources by the dispatch center.

Burnout operations were stopped before noon because of unfavorable burning conditions. For the next several hours, the crews experienced numerous spots across the line. Shortly after 1500 hours the spots became too large to control and the situation escalated. The spots split one crew with half going downhill to a safety zone while the others (9) retreated uphill to a pre-identified safety zone.

At about the same time two crewmembers from another crew, acting as pump operator and weather observer above their crew, moved into the black above the slopover to escape while their crew moved downhill to a safety zone below.

After talking with a helicopter that was over the division and supporting operations with a bucket the crew foreman (part of the 9 that moved uphill) decided to move further up the line to a second and larger safety zone where the helicopter had offered to pick them up. The helicopter pilot landed in a meadow, unhooked the bucket, and returned to pickup the upper portion of the crew with 9 crewmembers. (An aviation safecom has been filed by the helibase concerning this event.)

Red flag conditions and extreme fire behavior that had been predicted for the day developed around the time this incident occurred. When the fire escaped the temperature was 89 degrees (F) and the relative humidity was 19%. Energy release components were off the scale in the extreme and setting new records. All personnel on the incident had been briefed about conditions and required safety practices. Steep slope increased the time required to move the crew to safety zones.

A crew debriefing occurred where all affected parties discussed the days events and gleaned lessons that could be learned from an after action review.","Both crews had built, burned, and held the line for several days and had a lot of work invested in their line. None wanted to abandon the sum of their efforts until all hope of containment was lost. The two crew superintendants recognized that predicted vs observed weather was accurate and conformed to predictions shared at the morning briefing. Many indicators existed that fire behavior was escalating, however neither crew abandoned their effort until the last moment. The spots grew with surprising speed even though the crew was right there to attempt to catch them. In the after action review both superintendents stated that if they had disengaged 3-5 minutes sooner, both crews could have moved to the downhill escape route without splitting the crew.    * The Incident Management Team had Safety Officers gather the facts concerning the days events.

* A Safety Officer returned to the site of the escape with one of the crews to review what happened and better understand conditions on the ground. The second crew was given an opportunity to visit the line as well.

* The Incident Commander, Operations Section Chief, and Safety Officer met with the crews to review the days events, discuss the welfare and actions of the crew, and learn ways to better handle a similar situation.

* An after action review was completed by the Deputy Incident Commander, Operations Section Chief, and all of the Hot Shot crews assigned to the incident.

* The Command and General Staff discussed lessons learned from the event.

* One of the key lessons learned is to disengage sooner rather than later when fire weather and fire behavior are deteriorating.

A Type 6 and a Type 4 engine responded. A road above the fire had been identified as the desired control line and the engines were being used to attempt to control spots as they occurred. The engines were parked at times in the identified safety zone and pulled out of the safety zone as needed to provide assistance to catch spots as they occurred across the road. The main fire was approximately 2 acres when I was assisted to go provide support on the fire. As I was enroute to the fire I heard radio traffic about an engine catching on fire and arrived at the scene shortly thereafter to find out what had happened.

The two engines had been parked intermittently in the identified safety zone and driven from the site to assist with suppression, as spots were located. The Type 6 engine was parked in the safety zone. The area around the engine had been cleared of sticks, but apparently a stick had been left between the left rear dual tires. This stick apparently caught fire and spread to the tires on the vehicle. The tires were burning when the assistant (acting) engine foreman returned to find it. He quickly extinguished the flames using the pump on the engine. He found the tires were not serviceable and that the rear brake lines had been burned.

The fire had been extinguished when I arrived. The wild fire was burning very erratically at this time and I determined the location where the engine was parked was safe and we continued suppression operations at this time. The engine was left in the safety zone. The fire spread direction changed several times through the afternoon as the fire grew to a final fire size of 113 acres. The previously identified safety zone was completely surrounded by fire but the truck was safe and needed no further protection.

At the end of the shift we considered several options for how to get the engine off the fire and to a mechanic where it could be serviced. We decided that it might be hazardous to try and haul it off the narrow two track where it was parked. A spare tire was put on the burned side and the engine was driven in low gear (to eliminate the need for braking) to a nearby road intersection where the engine was place upon a trailer and hauled to a mechanic's shop.

The extent of the damage at this time was assessed to be the two lost tires, a burned fuel supply line (leading to the fuel tank), and the brake lines.

The truck had been in the shop several days when we were told it was ready to pick up. We had another fire start as the crew was picking up the engine. The crew realized that another brake line that had not been identified as being damaged was leaking when the truck was picked up.

The engine operator informed me, as he was enroute to the new start that the engine had a leak in one of the lines, but three of the brakes were operating. I had arrived on the fire by this time and determined the fire to be a threat to some power lines above the fire. I called dispatch to see if any other trucks were available and there were no other engines available on the unit, so I had the engine 652 respond to the fire. When the engine arrived, I learned that in fact only the front brakes were working, but I decided to use it to suppress the fire at this time.

I came back to town and talked to a couple of local mechanics who told me that it would be okay to drive the engine. I did not feel entirely comfortable in allowing it to operate, so when it got back to town, I red flagged it for operations until it was completely serviceable. The truck was returned to the mechanics shop where the repairs were completed before the truck was used again.","The major factor of concern to me was to make sure that complete preoperational safety inspections are completed on damaged equipment before it is placed back into service.","09/11/2003 00:00"

The Branch Director's plan was to skip over an area of the fire that was lined but unburned and had fire well below it and continue with line construction well beyond that point eventually going down along the Chewach River.  The other two personnel, the Division Supervisor and the Safety Officer, tried to talk me into taking that assignment and seemed to be bothered at my reluctance.  I pointed out that, from where they wanted us to begin our line construction, there was no safe anchor point.  We could not see the fire from where we would be, our escape route would be compromised, we would be too far from our safety zone, and we would have no safety zones near where they wanted us to go.  We had already done some preliminary scouting and had not liked what we saw.  I said we would take the assignment if we could take the black with us and we would burn the 2000 feet of unburned area along the line that had fire below it.  The Branch Director was adamant that we not try that, since his fear was that we would not be successful based on his previous experience in burnouts on that fire.  All three said what if we mitigated the lookouts and put more in other areas.  I said we had already scouted things out, and that with no safety zones, compromised escape routes, no anchor point, and extreme conditions, I would not feel comfortable taking the assignment.  This discussion and various forms of it went on for a while.  Finally, I said if we take this assignment we would be outright breaking 3 and possibly 4 of the standard fire fighting orders and several of the watchout situations.  At this point, the Division Supervisor started not to like what he was hearing in regards to the potential safety violations.  The Safety Officer and Branch Director still wanted to know if it could 'be done'.  I told them yes it could be done, but only with breaking safety regulations and fire fighting orders.  The next questions were 'what if they were mitigated?'  My answer to that was that we had already scouted it out and did not see how we could take the assignment safely without a safe anchor point.  We needed to burn an area out to even have a good anchor and take care of our escape route to the safety zone.  Branch was not comfortable with us burning the area. I pointed out all the support we had, the water and hoses we already had in place and how close we were to the safety zone and everything was in our favor.  He still was not comfortable and once again pushed to follow his plan.  I pointed again that of LCES only the 'C' would be covered.  At this point, the Safety Officer seemed to rethink his position.  The Branch Director was insistent on his plan.  At this point, I asked if he was willing to 'bet twenty lives on his plan'.  The answer I got was shocking and dismaying.  Yes, he would take that risk.  My whole take on his attitude was that it was ego driven and based on a poor knowledge of tactics and fire behavior.  His attitude showed a complete disregard for the safety of the people working on his branch.  During his tenure as Branch Director there were at least two serious accidents that required two medivacs and a disturbing lack of logistical support or regard for safety.  It eventually took a visit by the Operations Section Chief and IC to allow us to make a safe anchor point to proceed from.","Continuing education of the Branch Director in regards to fire behavior and fireline tactics.

Counseling of Division Supervisor and Safety Officer as to what their primary responsibility is on the fireline.

Continued performance by Branch Director similar to what we experienced and a continued pattern of serious accidents and disregard for safety of fireline personnel in the branch would be cause for removal as branch on the team and a reevaluation of qualifications to perform at present level on the fireline as well.    We discussed at length and kept our discussions professional.  Without formally refusing the assignment, I agreed to look at it.  We put off committing to the assignment by scouting more extensively and not committing until we could mitigate all our safety concerns.","10/23/2003 00:00"

The briefing consisted of FIX IT.  For the record now, safety briefing or situational awareness briefing was conducted.  The co-worker that accompanied me had been to this site two times before with other workers and knew the way.  At no time was a safety brief conducted.  We proceeded to the entry to the Fort Wainwright RANGE, with posted signs to contact range control prior to entry (this too had never been done on any of the other trips).  I contacted range control and was informed that the range was HOT (meaning a artillery exercise was being conducted).  I was told on the phone to proceed with caution since I did not know just where we were going. We gave our phone number to range control and proceeded to the site of the RAWS.  AGAIN, THE AREA WAS CLEARLY A RANGE OF SOME SORT WITH THE EQUIPMENT LOCATED SOME 25 TO 50 MTRS BEHOND THE OLD FIRING LINE.  The area was clearly marked no trespassing unexploded munitions hazards!  Lacking any information about the area, I decided to abort the mission and return to Fort Wainwright.  I contacted Range Control leaving the area to insure they knew we were clear.  I was asked to stop by his office to get a locate as to where we were, which I did.  We were located (the equipment) right on the edge of an impact area in a firing range.  We could get no information as to if the area was safe, we were told to assume it was not!

This area had been visited at least 3 times prior to this and at no time were any safety precautions taken, and at no time were personnel (I asked) given a briefing on any hazards or procedures when entering the range area.  THIS IS A SERIOUS BREACH OF SAFETY AND COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A VERY SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.

Backup systems failed to keep the dispatch center operational.  A dispatcher was immediately sent to the backup console located in Salt Lake City (a 30 minute drive with no traffic).  At the time of the power failure, an air attack, lead plane, SEAT, heavy air tanker and 3 helicopters were working the fire.  Northern Utah was only able to provide intermittent communications during this time.  The dispatcher sent to Salt Lake took over communication with the fire at 2030.  In the interim, a vehicle mobile radio was used to notify air attack of the situation and request local flight following of aircraft.  Power failures have been an ongoing problem at the dispatch center.  Several attempts have been made to correct the situation.  The electrician who initially responded to this power failure, found the backup generator to be insufficient as the power output is inconsistent with significant voltage spikes.  Dispatch consoles at the main dispatch center continued to operate on UPS battery power until the batteries eventually failed (20-40 minutes depending on the UPS).  Commercial power was restored at 2230 hours.  Until the backup power situation is corrected, Northern Utah is staffing two offices.","A properly functioning generator and on-line UPS system should correct this problem.  Two different UPS units have been damaged (presumably by the malfunctioning generator).

During previous power outages, the generator would switch on right away, but not in time to prevent the radios from shutting down.

Salt Lake Helitack and Air Attack 27N arrived on scene within two minutes of each other.  Neither Salt Lake nor Air Attack were able to raise the USFS helitack crew on the assigned AM or FM frequencies.

The fire was started by lightning and reported by the lookout to be 1/4 acre in grass and some brush.  Due to fire activity over the 4th of July weekend, we did not have any crews on day off.  Our IA crews started at 0900 and went off at 2000 with no activity.  Because of Red Book CDL duty day requirements, at 2200 the engine crews (7136, 7137) only had 2 hours of CDL driving time left.  By the time the crews were mobilized they would only have time to drive to a staging area near the fire, so they could bed down to meet the required 8 hours off (BLM manual 9210.)  The engines were instructed to bed down by 2400 (the end of their 15 hour duty day) and be up at 0800.  Three additional engines (7140, 7141, 7142) were instructed to come on at 0400, to meet the required 8 hours off, and be available if the fire grew in size.  At 2400 on 7/7/03, Engines 7136 and 7137 bedded down at a staging area away from the fire.  The lookout reported the fire at 1/2 acre and not doing much.

At 0230 on 7/8, I received a call from dispatch that high winds had hit the fire and it was now 100 to 200 acres and threatening structures.  The rurals were asking for assistance.  I instructed dispatch to wake up 7136 and 7137 and send them to the fire.  This violated the Redbook CDL duty day requirements.  I returned to dispatch and sent two additional dozers; another violation of Redbook CDL duty day.  At 0300 I sent a Type 3 IC (from the Helitack crew) who had been on day to the fire.  At 0400 we sent Engines 7140, 7141, and 7142.

After establishing unified command, the IC requested a helicopter, an additional engine, and a Hotshot crew in addition to the 5 engines on scene from the rural fire department.  By this time it was 0600 and all resources meet rest requirements.  No structures were lost; the fire ended up being 393 acres.  Engine 7136 and 7137 were released and in quarters by 1400.  Well within the 2:1 initial attack exemption.

Safety issues

Violation of CDL duty day by engines and dozers.

Delaying initial attack to comply with CDL policy.  By adhering to CDL policy I delayed initial attack of a 1/2 acre fire, which probably could have been handled by 2 engines before the winds hit at 0200. Delayed initial attack caused the fire to grow, threatening structures, and requiring more personnel to suppress the fire. Thereby putting more people at risk.","CDL policy regulations need to be in line with work rest guidelines.

If CDL policy stays the same, we will need additional funding to staff a second shift for our engines.  Current policy effectively cuts our engine workforce in half.  We could order in severity engines to supplement our workforce so that we can staff a night shift.

We are not funded or staffed appropriately to implement the CDL policy as it currently stands.    We have tried to solve the problem by staggering shifts, not calling in resources during red flag periods or for extended staffing, so that we will have crews with fresh duty days if we get a fire.  Basically we are doing the opposite of what our staffing plan calls for during periods of high fire danger.  Crews that have been on standby for an 8-hour day are almost worthless if you get any initial attack after they have gone off shift.","07/09/2003 00:00"

Fire behavior had increased dramatically (borderline plume domination) in his division to the point where he wanted to use the heavy helitankers that were being deployed at the time in the unstaffed Division A.  He stated a need to 1) protect his ground troops in the area, and 2) try to hang on to a ridge critical to holding actions in his division.  The ground contact would be Division B Safety Officer.

The helitankers had been working in the unstaffed Division A to attempt, without benefit of ground forces, to hold the fire above Turnbo Canyon ostensibly to protect Gila Trout some miles downstream from potential ash flow. They were, at the time, not at all successful in stopping the fire spread and they were operating in marginal conditions due to smoke and turbulence.  I ordered them to Division B based on 1) safety concerns in Division B, and 2) safety and efficiency concerns held by myself and the pilots for their activities in Division A.

Shortly thereafter I was notified by recon helicopter 305 that the Wilderness District Ranger, who was on board, wanted the heavy helitankers moved back to Division A.  My reply was that we would finish out this fuel cycle on Division B due to our collective concerns (myself and personnel in Division B) and then move them back to the unstaffed Division A, conditions permitting (which we did about two hours later).

Top priority given for the fire was SAFETY OF FIREFIGHTERS.  My given priorities (by the Fire Use Team) for helicopter use for the day were:

Priority 1: Stop the fire spread in the Turnbo Creek/Mogollon Creek drainages in Division A to protect Gila trout.

Priority 2: Provide support as requested to Division B.","It has now been demanded by the District Ranger, ostensibly for my actions on 7/7/03, that I be dismissed from my position as ATGS on the Dry Lake Complex.  I will happily do so but have a serious concern that 'Safety First' is taking 2nd priority here to other district concerns regarding this otherwise highly successful Wildland Fire Use fire.  I also will be filing a SAFECOM to the effect that the formidable responsibilities of the ATGS are being compromised here with a DR not working through the chain-of-command to effect a change in operational deployment of aircraft.

On 7/16/03 at 1715, I arrived at the Phoenix Airport, 11 hours after reporting to my duty station.  The driver arrived more than two hours later from Springerville but could not leave until two more people arrived.  During the time at the airport, I overheard the driver talk on his cell phone about several driving infractions he had and the elk he nearly hit a few nights before.  By the time we left the airport, five hours after my arrival, myself and one of the other passengers had exceeded the 2:1 ratio, but the driver was told by expanded dispatch to bring us to Springerville, AZ.  We traveled from 2200 to 0230 on 07/17/03.  By the time we arrived, the driver had been driving at least 11.5 hours and I had been awake nearly 24 hours.  We were all sleepy driving through a canyon (Sand Canyon I believe), a dangerous drive at night.  After nearly driving off the road, the driver admitted he was not alert as he needed to be, and one of the passengers and I complained about traveling since early the previous morning. The third passenger slept part of the way.  The driver called expanded dispatch, explained the situation and asked if we could be taken directly to where we needed to go (Springerville was a 1.5 hour drive beyond my destination.)  He was told we all needed to report to expanded dispatch first.  When we arrived, we were only asked our name and order number. When we were informed that we would immediately be taken back to our destination, I stated I absolutely could not stay awake to make the drive. Another passenger objected also, and only then were we allowed to suspend travel and stay in a hotel in Springerville.  After 21 hours of travel, I was allowed eight hours to rest before being driven to my destination.

I am concerned about this situation for three reasons:

1) Fatigue: The driver had to drive too long, and the passengers were extremely sleepy because of their length of travel.

2) Driving conditions: It was late at night, on a road through elk country, and through a canyon with hairpin turns and drop-offs of several hundred feet.

3) Disregard of rules regarding travel, e.g. 2:1 work/rest ratios, limits on driver's hours of driving, etc.

I only ask that the responsible party that night consider these reasons before making similar decisions.  The unwavering decision on having us come to Springerville from Phoenix that night could have easily gotten us killed.","","08/26/2003 00:00"

On July 4, beginning at 1930, fire one unit from the Kingman F.O. was responding to a fire report and others were on holiday patrols.  At the same time, Law Enforcement Units from BLM Havasu, Yuma and AZ Strip, NPS Saguaro NP, and Havasu FWS were conducting LE operations in the field.  All units were affected by these events with a definite potential to compromise employee safety.

Being July 4th, it was a major holiday for law enforcement; a very busy recreational holiday with a lot of law enforcement personnel on duty continuously running checks for drivers' license/registration and want/warrant information on persons and vehicles. The poor quality of the radio system eliminated approximately 30-50% of requests being handled effectively and efficiently.  Transactions, which should have taken 10-20 seconds of airtime, consumed 3-5 minutes of airtime to get across the same amount of information.  This led to extremely non-productive usage of radio transmissions and, most importantly, an unsafe situation for the field units.  The fire unit (E-267) enroute to the fire report found the fire was on an adjacent F.O. with suppression in progress.  The adjacent F.O. ordered an engine from us to assist and E-267 was directed to respond to the fire.  Due to the radio problems, the dispatcher was unable to relay directions and IC contact information until the engine was in cell phone contact with the dispatcher.  All other fire units in the field also reported dispatch was broken, unreadable or that transmissions were one-sided (not copied at all).

Due to technical/design problems that have been on-going and are in different states of discovery, remedy, troubleshooting or re-design, when LE and Fire units transmit at the same time they 'walk-on' or block each other with neither the field units nor the dispatch center ever getting through consistently or clearly.  Units that are not on the same frequencies but share MT (Mountain Top) repeater sites experience interference or other technical problems causing the transmissions to not get through consistently or at all.  Some MT sites also seem to be feeding back and interfering with other MT repeater sites.  In some cases, transmissions were going through to dispatch but not from dispatch back out to the field.  In most cases, congestion seemed to be a problem but also some repeaters seemed to be working only one way (Juniper MT in Tucson and the repeaters on the AZ Strip).

Fire personnel and dispatchers cannot rely on this communication system and feel that it compromises safety.

See corrective action.","Well-designed and maintained radio system; designed and implemented to achieve the mission of the BLM without compromising safety.    The immediate and possibly near term solution for fire was implemented as follows.  The Phoenix-Kingman staff had previously tested the AZ state communication system to use as a backup in case of such a failure. This has been under discussion since the safety issues related to radios from the last 18+ months. We found their system to be from equal to superior to ours with some minor lapses in coverage addressed in the report from our survey.

On July 5, the Phoenix-Kingman Zone Fire organization implemented this backup until further notice.  The AZ State center welcomed our dispatchers and they are being trained on the State system with assistance from State Dispatch Employees.  All initial attack units are being dispatched through the state system currently.  One to two BLM fire dispatchers will staff at the State Land Office to cover IA with the assistance of the State employees.  One fire intelligence dispatcher will remain at the BLM office to cover those duties. Fire management will continue to monitor the situation and provide additional support to ensure that initial and extended attack operations have adequate radio communications.

The Law Enforcement communications issues still remain.  At 22:30, dispatchers attempted to reroute LE traffic to Lake Mead (which dispatches our LE units on the graveyard shift).  However, due to the quantity of traffic, ongoing LE actions and interference on the system and the time taken phone calls to and from officers trying to reach dispatch this conversion to Lake Mead took over one hour.  When the conversion occurred, officers found the transmissions from Lake Mead to be much clearer than from our center; units that were unable to talk with our center could talk with Lake Mead over the same MT's.  Lake Mead did however experience difficulty with one-way traffic on Juniper (couldn't hear the officer) and transmissions had a lot of noise and feedback.

This conversion to Lake Mead was done for the evening only.  LE traffic is back in the BLM center for day and swing shift however, without fire units competing for airtime and contributing to walkover the problem should be lessened. However, a number of repeater issues must be addressed for the LE units to have safe reliable communications with dispatch.","07/07/2003 00:00"

The main problem appears to be the relay of transmissions back and forth across the Grand Canyon from the district to Williams Dispatch.  This is accomplished in one of two ways, T1 phone lines and microwave relays.  On July 9th a bundle of T1 lines was cut in Flagstaff at 0830.  This took away the ability to communicate with dispatch by any means, including cell phones.  I made arrangements with Cedar City Dispatch to use them as a point of contact if necessary.  In the mean time, I stayed in a central location and tracked my resources.  The radio system was switched to the microwave at about 1400 as I was sending resources to a fire.  Williams gradually regained radio communications.  On July 17th we had a major lightning storm.  The link to dispatch became mostly inoperable at mid-day (we could hear them but they could not hear us).  I had to stay in a central location and relay information to dispatch by cell phone.  All operations were conducted safely, including aircraft flight following, but my ability to provide management oversight on wildland fires was severely impacted.

The crew I was on was sent out as an IA crew for various lightening strikes, so there really wasn't an organized camp and so on. Basically it was about 5 or 6 crews that stayed in a high school gym. (The crews consisted of several Hot Shot crews and BIA crews) I can't really remember exact dates and times but all I remembered was what happened. Like I said we all slept on the open gym floor of some high school and in the middle of the night I heard someone kick my cd player. I kinda opened my eyes a little and it was dark, they turned the lights off in the gym around 11 I think but the emergency lights were on. I could see the outline of a guy standing sorta over me. He laid down right behind me and started grabbing my breasts and below my waist. I was so scared I didn't know what to do. I was afraid to scream or make any noise. I just laid there and thought in my head if I don't move or pretend I'm sleeping they'll go away. I never opened my eyes and I just laid still until he was finished and got up and left. To this day I've been traumatized of the whole experience. I don't know why this person did this to me and why they did it in such an open area. I remember having my eyes half open, looking at some guys from my crew, wishing they would get up and help me. I never saw who was doing this to me. After that I stayed to myself and slept zipped up in my sleeping bag until we were sent to another assignment out of state. Once we got to another incident I told my story to some ff from the same agency but different crew, they told me I was sexually assaulted (I didn't know what to call what happened to me), to let my supervising bosses know. I never told anyone and I asked them to not tell anyone, I was ashamed. I did tell them however I seen his profile, a guy with curly hair. Two guys on my crew had curly hair; one was a squad boss and the other a crew boss. I left it at that, I tried to let my FMO know at the home agency but she never did anything.

I feel the reason I'm reporting this now is because this will be my first time on a fire assignment since that time. I am scared of reporting this because I don't want to be labeled as a troublemaker and not sent out on fire. I do however hope that more awareness is sent out to the fire community about sexual assault and sexual harassment on the fire line. I hope me reporting this does just that. I know now that I will never look at my crew or other fire fighters with the same trust, pride, and respect as I had before.

Arrived on scene at approximately 12:30 and informed the Central Washington Communications Center (CWICC) that I was on scene and assuming command of the fire.  I could not communicate with CWICC on our normal radio repeater but had to use an auxiliary repeater (North 20 Mile).  I was unable to communicate with the Methow Valley Ranger District (MVRD) Duty Officer (DO) on this repeater but could communicate on our normal District Repeater (McClure/Sweetgrass).  This meant that in order to keep CWICC and the DO appraised of the fire situation I had to do two summaries on two different radio channels.  I had contact with two lookouts and crews on a third channel and Air Attack on a fourth.  Radio traffic was at times intense and complex and I was forced to use an additional person as a full time radio operator in order to ensure I did not miss a radio call.  At this time no crews were actively engaged on the fire.  If I had had multiple crews engaged my communications span of control would have been broken.  I felt that Fire Order # 7 was severely compromised due to my inability to communicate with Supervisor and Dispatch.  Additionally, at times, watch situation # 7 could not be mitigated.  Frequently, when I attempted to call CWICC it would take repeated attempts over a 10 to 15 minute time frame.  If I had a critical need for resources these delays would have been reflected in the suppression response time.  Due to on-going retardant drops and erratic fire behavior I was unable to commit ground forces but if these factors had not been present I probably would not have committed until the communications problems had been resolved.  Another problem I encountered was that when the primary fire dispatcher I was dealing with was not on the microphone the replacement dispatcher did not seem to have any idea about what was going on my fire so I would have to give them a who, what, when, where, how and why.

These radio problems were noted and reported during our prescribed fire program in April and May 2003. North Cascades Smokejumper Base (NCSB) Smokejumpers enroute to initial attack a fire (Incident 120) noted and reported similar problems.

In addition to the technical difficulties described above there were numerous problems with resource ordering and tracking.  According to my incident log, I ordered a dozer at 13:48.  Throughout the day I repeatedly called CWICC to enquire about this dozer's ETA (these calls are documented in my log.)  This dozer was essential to construct a safety zone prior to the commitment of ground forces and CWICC was repeatedly informed of this fact.  The dozer finally showed up about 20:00.  There are numerous dozers already on Emergency Rental Agreements locally and if the ordering process had worked as it should have I should have had it with two hours.  At the same time I ordered the dozers I ordered a contract falling team. This team showed up at the same time the dozer did.  This resource also would have been imperative to snag ahead of ground crews and in the vicinity of the safety zone.","The technical radio problems are being worked on I am told.  However we are in fire season and people’s lives are dependent on reliable communications.  These technical fixes need to be top priority.  Dispatch needs to be fully staffed so there are adequate numbers to operate all radio consoles-especially during critical initial attack.  Fire traffic should be priority traffic.  When a radio operator leaves a console the replacement operator should be fully briefed on on-going fire traffic and resource tracking.  Resource ordering should be expedited and Incident Commanders should be kept informed on the status of resource orders (availability, estimated times of arrival and status changes.)","07/08/2003 00:00"

While trying to communicate with our dispatch during daily duties, the traffic from E-263 to dispatch was loud and clear in the dispatch office, however when dispatch tried to communicate back, nothing was getting through.  In the event of a fire, we would have to rely solely on our cell phones.  Cell phone coverage is hit or miss, and battery life is limited.  During the hours from 1500 to 1800, circuits become so overloaded with the cell system that at times it may take up to 30 to 45 minutes to get a call through.  This uses up time and battery life.  Since we rely on someone else's system to get our job done, we will be without communications if cell batteries die or if the cell phone companies experience any problems.  This leaves us with no communications at all.  This particular problem happened to us earlier this year, and I submitted a SAFENET on that situation.

Another problem is the possible need for aircraft.  I am well aware that we can flight follow from the incident.  However, our radios will only work line of sight so aircraft have to be near the incident before we can go this route.  In the meantime, there isn't any possibility of flight following through our dispatch until incident personnel can take over.  This presents a problem if we encounter a running fire and need additional resources, or in the event that someone becomes injured.

We are told time and time again to watch the minutes on our cell phones to reduce the size of the bills.  This continuing problem gives us no choice.  Its either use the cell phones, or not communicate with our dispatch.

The people within this fire organization are getting frustrated with the continuing problem with our radio system.  It is understandable that this problem cannot be fixed overnight, but we are to the point now where we find ourselves asking why couldn't this problem be fixed over the course of several years and still counting?","Establish a dependable radio system.  We do have communications among firefighters on the ground.  The problem lies within our repeater system.

On 4-7-02, I submitted a SAFENET on the Aspen fire, one example of many. On this particular SAFENET corrective action was taken and reads as follows:

WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST TO ENSURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN?

A telecom team from NIFC and the Bureau National Office was sent to AZ to identify, prioritize, and take immediate action to correct telecommunication problems with the fire program to an acceptable operational period. A copy of the team's report is available at NIFC - contact John Gebhard at (208)387-5164 or Michelle Ryerson-Grett at (208)387-5175.  This was dated 7-17/02.  The same corrective action is attached to Goodwin Mesa RX Burn submitted on 4-14-2002.

These are the only SAFENETs submitted by our district on the radio problem in which corrective action is attached. The radio problem is ongoing.  Has there been any follow up on the corrective action mentioned above?  Or any future plans to try and make this problem right?    The only way local resources can resolve the problem is to use cell phones when possible.  There have been times when we were not able to talk with our dispatch for over half an operational period due to lack of cell coverage.  This has tied up the Incident Commander and Firefighters trying to find a spot to get out.  The radio system we have now continues to fail.  We need something dependable.

The BLM engines had worked from 0900 to 1900 on the 6/24 with a 1-hour lunch break.  The engines responded to the ditch fire at 0130 on 6/25.  The CDL drivers for the engines did not have the mandatory 8 hours off between shifts.  Therefore they either violated the rest component of the CDL regulations or the length of duty day specified in the Red Book.  The personnel who responded to the incident meet 2:1 work rest guidelines but did not meet Red Book CDL requirements.","This really is not a safety issue it’s a policy issue.  Conflicting policy (CDL vs. W/R) makes initial attack of fires extremely difficult.  We are not funded or staffed for 2 shifts, which is the only real way to make the CDL policy work.    We will rotate crews as much as possible, but the driving reg policy needs to change to eliminate the problem.   Adhering to the 2:1 would mitigate the driving policy.","06/25/2003 00:00"

This SAFENET documentation is designed 'to alert management' and correct 'a unique safety-related issue' that is now inhibiting our job to serve the citizens of the United States and to use fire as a tool to both suppression and management ignited fires.

Using the 2003 'Standards for Fire and Aviation Operation' manual as my reference, page 4-6, directly limits operators with valid commercial drivers license to a 15-hour duty day.  Furthermore, this policy states any person with a CDL must follow this direction.  On the afternoon of June 26, 2003, approximately 1500, a wildfire was reported northwest of Emmett, ID.  Two BLM engines (type IV) responded from Wildwest fire station near New Plymouth, ID.  Two more engines were dispatched and enroute from Boise.  The fire was fast moving burning in light flashy fuels.  From the time of dispatch to containment (1700) the fire had grown over 600 acres.  Federal resources remained on the fire until 2230 that evening and departed the scene to meet the new D.O.T. policy.

At approximately 0100 a new wildfire was reported 4 miles northeast of Wildwest fire station.  The fire was visible to BLM crews; however, due to policy they were not allowed to respond to the fire, even after public concerns were directed towards firefighters at the station.  Engine crews from Boise were later dispatched to this fire.

This is one example in a slow starting fire season of how this policy does not work for initial attack and firefighting resources.  In my 13 years in federal fire this is the most negative and detrimental policy to date.

To resolve this issue I believe the BLM needs to finally take the stand on its firefighting personnel.  First, we need to make our engines emergency vehicles when responding to fires or other incidents.  This would mandate training in emergency driver.  By enacting this criteria our fire personnel would be exempt from D.O.T. regulations.

Thank you for your time. I hope this policy and the way the BLM interprets our duties and profession may soon be resolved.","","07/03/2003 00:00"

The ignition pattern had been an east/west strip-head fire parallel to the Brule River on the northern boundary of the unit.  The helicopter completed a fuel cycle and returned to the helispot for more fuel and spheres.  Prior to shutting down, the Burn Boss asked the Ignition Boss if they would continue with the east/west ignition pattern.  The Ignition Boss said that they would.

None of the personnel on the ground report hearing any communication of the change in the ignition sequence and it was only after smoke was observed coming from the southeast corner of the unit that most of the holding personnel were aware that spheres had been dropped along the east flank of the unit.  A weather observer had been stationed in the southeast corner of the unit, but had moved back to the road before spheres were dropped on the weather site.  The weather observer informed the closest holding personnel that spheres had been dropped along the road and ground personnel were able to adjust to the situation and maintain the line with a minimal amount of spotting.  It is possible that, if holding personnel had not been alerted by the weather observer and if they did not have easy access to the area, the situation could have been more serious than it turned out to be.","Aerial ignition platforms need to clearly communicate and verify their intentions to Burn Bosses and ground personnel, and verify that ground personnel are clear before putting any fire on the ground.

No matter what position you hold on fire assignment, fatigue increases the risk of mistakes. Ordering mistakes can be costly, affect line production and, with a cache crew, increase the probability of accidents.

The initial attack went smoothly only because of quick thinking by engine leaders.  The repeater system does not cover critical areas that have frequent urban interface fires.  This has been reported in the past and the situation deteriorated when a nearby repeater was removed.  This lack of communication forced the first USFS engine on scene to call in their fire size up on a cell phone.  This information was not passed on to other forces responding to the incident, all other responding federal resources would have been in the dark as to the fire size up until they arrived on scene.  If the radio coverage had been adequate all responding resources would have been able to get the information.

Knowing the area and the cooperating agency’s tactical frequencies federal resources were able to co-ordinate a switch to those frequencies and exchange much needed information.  Even with 30mph plus winds and 20 foot plus flame lengths we were able to coordinate splitting of resources to stop the fire spread from reaching three structures and eventually control the fire.","Both state agencies in our area have good coverage via their repeater locations.  There is a site on the Washington side of the river that would give great coverage but the IRM (Information Resource Management) people seem to think that there is adequate coverage in our area and thus the cost of installing this repeater would not be warranted.

If out of area resources were involved, that don't know how to plug in these frequencies, there would have been even more confusion and safety concerns.  With the fire behavior in the area, the initial attack that saved the structures had to happen rapidly.  These structures would have been lost if resources were not able to know other frequencies and switch to them while enroute.    A repeater known as Wasco was put in place a number of years ago.  This did a better job of hitting this area.  Unfortunately, the repeater had to be taken away due to landowner issues.  Our Fire Management Staff has repeatedly asked for a repeater on Stacker Butte that would hit all of these areas.","06/24/2003 00:00"

Buck Wickham

While assigned to the Picture Incident, on June 19, 2003 day shift on Division A, this engine was assigned without being briefed, and instructed to proceed to Drop Point 1 to be briefed for the assignment.  Upon arrival to the Drop Point the engine was assigned without being brief by the DIVS.  An unidentified individual instructed the engine crew to proceed up FR#416 up Juniper Canyon and mop up spot fire, which was on the side of the road.  Upon review of the fire orders the following were compromised:  #2 – “Know what your fire is doing at all times.”  The crew was informed that the fire had been grided by crews this and the previous day and was cold.  Smoke was visible to the crew and they knew this information was false. #3 – “Base all actions on current and expected fire behavior.”  The current and expected fire behavior was predicted to be 'advanced extreme'.  #4 – “Identify escape routes and safety zones, and make them known.”  The escape route (FR#416) was a narrow, one-lane side slope road with no turnarounds.  A dozer was initiating turn out construction from the top of the canyon down hill.  The crew was starting up from the bottom and no turnarounds were available at this location.  The Safety Zone was at the top of the hill, however it was not located upon a map, or were they able to reach it before the fire flared up forcing their retreat.  #5 – “Post lookouts when there is possible danger.”  Upon asking, the crew did find out a lookout was posted, however, they did not have any communication with the lookout and the lookout could not see the area that they were instructed to work.  This, in effect, was not an appropriate lookout. #7 – “Maintain prompt communications with your forces, your supervisor, and adjoining forces.”  Communications were not made with the DIVS or his trainee.  Efforts to make communication with the DIVS proved unsuccessful.  #8 – “Give clear instructions and make sure they are understood.”  Lack of adequate briefing, and inability to contact DIVS compromised this order.  #9 – “Maintain control of your forces at all times.”  Due to the lack of direction, briefing, communication, and intel on the current behavior of the fire, it seems this order was also violated.

After starting up the road to accomplish the task, they noticed that the fire activity was more than they had been told, and the fire was in fact not cold but still active.  The road was too narrow to turn the engine around once the vehicle started up the hill.  As the crew proceeded up the road an active spot was observed and this, with the uncertainty of compromising several of the fire orders, caused the crew to return down the hill to Drop Point 1. This was immediately possible due to the lack of turnouts.  Additional vehicles made turning around a slow process.  As the engine was proceeding back downhill on FR#416, the fire had become active producing approximately 30-foot flame lengths at a distance of 20' from the engine as it progressed down FR#416 to Drop Point 1.

There was no damage to the vehicle or crew.  Additional resources were impacted by this flare up, as this engine was following another Type 6 engine at a very close distance.  The engine notified additional division resources that the escape route had been compromised and that they should not proceed downhill but go back up toward the intended safety zone.

After this happened, and the engine crew did make contact with the DIVS, they determined that it was very unlikely that any safety zone was present, and the planned safety zone did not have the DIVS confidence that it was in fact a secure area at all.  When discussed with the DIVS he chuckled, downplaying the whole deal.","Follow the fire orders.

Provide briefings for incoming resources.

Handout IAP and maps during briefing.

Insure safety zones are adequate and really there.

Ensure lookouts can see areas that crews are working.

Provide some sort of traffic control on one-lane roads.

By chuckling at the crew when informed of the activities, the DIVS is not even close at providing leadership, and has obviously not placed safety in the proper context.    After discussions about the amount of fire orders violated, the crew had decided to disengage from the assignment.  This decision to disengage luckily was just in time to prevent entrapment of multiple resources.

Ensure team overhead are qualified, and provide leadership, direction, and provide for the safety of the resources assigned to their division.  Crews that have valid rational for disengagement should not be chided and should be taken seriously.","07/10/2003 00:00"

The most recent response from the radio techs was that the Gila Dispatchers, when calling Reserve or others in our area, were not going off of the right mountaintop. This is not the case because we can hear dispatch, they are garbled but we can still hear them on our handheld and mobile radios, but not the base stations here at the district.

We have almost made it through fire season without an accident, but radio communications is a must throughout the year with all functions. Communications is serious business and must be working right to help prevent a serious accident/fatality.","06/18/2003 00:00"

Tactics were to construct line or clear trails and prep for burnout.  Burnout would be accomplished as the fire progressed and approached the control lines in each division.  A firing operation plan and aerial ignition PSD plan was developed to accomplish the tactics.  An addendum made some minor changes to a nighttime hand ignition for DIV D.

The Operation Section Chief Trainee flew to DIV D to discuss the firing operation plan with the crews and overhead.  The Division Supervisor for DIV D, Division Supervisor trainee, and two IHC Supervisors and Crew Foremen met and reviewed the Firing Operation Plan.  All agreed on a nighttime hand firing operation across Paradise Park as stated in the Firing Plan.  This decision was due in part to the torching and profuse short range spotting that had been occurring during previous daytime burnouts due to very dry fuel conditions.  Crews were to strip fire from the north side south to the trail during the evening hours to reduce the amount of mortality that could result from a middle of the burning period ignition.  Personnel on DIV D would start the shift late so that extended shift would not be required for the evening burnout.  A third IHC  would burnout a section of DIV E line down to the DIV D/E break, bed down, and continue burnout and holding operations early the next morning that were not completed from the night before in DIV D.

Two Operations Section Chiefs, the Ops trainee, the Ignition Specialist, and the Incident Commander discussed the next day firing operations and division assignments at the pre-strategy meeting.  There was no talk of aerial ignition in the 2000 acre Paradise Park DIV D area and no changes made to the firing operation plan.  The fact that only inadequate deployment zones existed on the east and west end of the park was the reason that the crews would carry black with them as their safety zone.  To date, the fire was only moving 20-30 chains or less per 24 hour period on a consistent rate of spread.  The fires perimeter was not position to have this kind of combined alignment and was essentially in a backing and flanking posture toward the southern control line for the next 48-72 hours.  I had to leave the fire the next morning on district duties but remained in radio and cell phone contact

On June 13th, I had to leave the fire that morning for district duties but remained in radio and phone contact. The Air Attacks initial morning size-up was that the fire had backed its way off the high rim only on the far northeast end of Paradise Park and continued to back slowly toward the fireline over a mile away.  The IMETS weather forecast was for a weak disturbance to pass through the area early, turning winds more northwest (20 foot winds) 6-10 mph by afternoon and north by evening, then becoming downslope/downvalley 1-3 mph around 2000 hours.  A return to high pressure would follow over the next several days.  The fire behavior forecast from FBAN was fire intensity would be low early in the shift and increase to above the limits for direct attack by hand crews by 1100 hours.  In DIVD, fire would spread toward control line as a flanking fire at 1 chain per hour.  The IAP day operational period for DIV D’s assignment reads “begin burnout from spike camp going west toward Division E/D break and east down to White Oak Springs.  Begin hand ignition ONLY after DIV E has completed their burnout operations.”

At about 1630 a large column developed rapidly with a very distinct cauliflower shaped cap at approximately 25,000 feet above the surface, becoming very dark brown and gray in color.  I called Firing Operations and asked what happened.  He reported that he had aerial ignited several lines down the middle of Paradise Park.  I called the DIV D Supervisor by radio and asked if the fire had made a unexpected run toward the control line.  His response was that the fire had slowly backed toward them during the day but had blown-up after the unplanned aerial ignition was initiated by Firing Operations during the late afternoon on the interior of the park.  The ignition squads that were in place on the interior awaiting hand firing had to hastily evacuate and the crew on the line near spike camp in the middle of park had to hurriedly fire the line, attempting to provide some black as a safety zone.  He estimated 70-80 acre slop-over east of the spike camp due to the plume collapse and that 40-50 percent of Paradise Park had wide spread torching and crowning fire behavior.  The intense plume dominated fire activity was aerial ignition induced by Firing Ops. The Firing plan was not followed by Firing Ops or Ignitions Ops.  The hand firing night operation was changed without prior notice or communicated up and down the line.  The main objective for the incident of providing for firefighter and aviation personnel safety and adherence to the 30 mile OSHA Abatement Plan was not met.  Also, the aerial ignition induced plume dominated fire and subsequent collapse of the column had produced unplanned and unpredicted extreme, erratic fire behavior on DIVD that nearly culminated into multiple injuries or fatalities of 40 crewmembers and 4 overhead personnel.","Persons in Firing Operation positions must make informed intelligent decisions that include a valid assessment of risks related to their actions.  Operation personnel are required to adhere to the standing operational plan until changes are discussed and approved by their supervisor.  Any operational plan changes must be communicated to all overhead and crews, that may be affected, in a timely manner. Operation personnel that ignore, neglect, or intentionally break the 10 STANDARD ORDERS and/or the OSHA 30 MILE ABATEMENT PLAN must be held accountable for their actions.    Recommended to the line officer that the firing operation incident in question and personnel involved needs to be studied further.  The study should include similar past situations of the involved personnel and their performance that have possibly resulted in other near miss and close calls that were overlooked because there was no major injuries or fatalities.","07/06/2003 00:00"

The burnouts for DIV's A-C that occurred on 6/10-12 were implemented according to the plan.  On 6/12 burnout operations were started on DIV E, but were discontinued due to adverse wind conditions and a check line was constructed to hold the operation until the next day.

On 6/13 the IAP identified that DIV's D&E were to continue and complete their burnout operations.  DIV D was to commence burnout operations only after the burnout was completed in DIV E.  Morning winds were from the southeast-south, but were predicted to move to the west-northwest by mid-afternoon.  Fire behavior was predicted to intensify by mid-day.  DIV D was to be ignited along the control line (southern end of fire) in the evening, but only after the burnout in DIV E was completed. Escape routes were planned for and safe areas on the sw and se were identified (based on hand ignition along the control line).

DIV E tried to conduct their burnout, but shut down on several occasions due to adverse winds and spotting across their control line.  They finally stopped burning once and for all at about 1530.  At some point the morning of 6/13, overhead personnel decided to aerially ignite along a ridge north of the DIV D&E control line.  Aerial ignition operations laid down at least 5 lines of ping-pong balls north of the DIV D control line on a south facing aspect with ponderosa pine and brush fields.  During mid-afternoon ground forces conducted test burns on the sw and se corners along the control line.  A massive 20,000+ foot column built (from the aerial ignition operations) and rolled over, possibly due to the wind shifting to the west, forcing ground units to strip light along the control line to allow time to pull back to their designated safe areas.  The planned burnout in DIV D, with 5 days of preparation by ground forces, most likely would have met the desired objectives; backing fire, understory burn, minimum impact suppression tactics, etc., however, the overzealous aerial ignition caused approximately 85% mortality over 1800 acres of old-growth ponderosa pine and caused a situation that could have caused mortality for approximately 45 firefighters.

There was a lot of confusion, lack of communication, non-adherence to the plans of action, disregard for anticipated weather and fire behavior conditions, lack of situational awareness, and loss of control by the firing operations section chief.","Develop a plan of action; ensure that all personnel are aware of the planned actions and what their role is. Implement the plan considering predicted weather conditions and current and expected fire behavior. Monitor the execution of the plan and mitigate or change tactics as fire behavior, weather, or topography becomes adverse to the plan.  Communicate all deviations from the plan and ensure that all involved personnel are aware of changing conditions.  Ensure that a competent individual is in charge at all times; someone with good communication skills, someone that understands fire behavior, someone that takes pride in being able to execute a plan according to the prescription, someone that maintains situational awareness, someone willing to take control when everything goes to hell.  It does not do any good for all of the leaders to be passive players. COMMUNICATIONS UP THE LINE AND BACK DOWN! 

Basically, adherence to the 10 Standard Fire Orders and 18 Watchout Situations would have gone a long way in making sure that the operation was successful.","06/25/2003 00:00"

Our mission was to bring fire along a razorback ridge to Division D. It was made perfectly clear by the Operations Trainee, from the previous 5 days briefings, that there was no hurry to finish this operation.  It was also made perfectly clear that the forest did not want fire into Grant creek, which was the drainage immediately to the south of the ridge we were to burn.  It was my understanding that once we commenced the burn operation, an aerial ignition was to occur in conjunction with our operation to burn a bowl out.  This was to reduce the risk of running major fire into the bowl and thus reduce tree mortality.  The conditions were not conducive to burn early in the shift.  This was relayed to Operations.  At 11:30 AM we realized that Operations was in an aerial platform leading the ping-pong machine in a burn operation.  They laid a row of fire along the rim of the bowl we were to burn.  We relayed to Ops that conditions were not good for burning.  The winds were blowing across our lines and we didn't think we could hold the fire on the ridge.  Ops said they would generate some heat to pull the fire in.  We told him we did not want to burn at this time. He pressured the DIVS Trainee numerous times (over 3) to burn down to H1 which was located at the end of the ridge before it bailed off down an extremely steep slope into Div D.  The DIVS Trainee then asked me if this was a safety issue.  I answered it was not, it was a spotting issue.  Why all of a sudden were we in such a hurry to burn this after being repeatedly told to go slow?  After intense pressure from Operations, the DIVS Trainee asked me to commence the burn.  I went on record as saying this was a very bad idea and that I didn't think we could hold the line.  The DIVS Trainee did an excellent job of relaying our (his and mine) concerns to Ops but it seemed that Ops was determined to burn. After we commenced the burn, Ops went into Div D and commenced an aerial ignition.  They generated so much heat that a plume-dominated event was occurring.  At that point it was determined we had better check our burn because bad things were about to happen in Div D.  The column collapsed on Div D and blew out between another IHC.  We had predicted north winds that day.  The fireline was south of the firing operation on a south-facing slope of ponderosa pine.

There was no leadership to be found from Operations that day.  It was some of the worst decision-making I have ever witnessed.  Risk assessment and situational awareness were nonexistent.  Operations was reckless with a cavalier attitude that could have killed over 20 people.","If we had followed the plan and not hurried the burn this NEVER would have happened.  

If Ops had listened to his resources on the ground and heeded their advice this NEVER would have happened.    The DIV E DIVS Trainee told Ops many times we could not burn at this time.  I offered input constantly to try and sway Ops to not burn to H1.

This SAFENET needs to be forwarded to Jerome Macdonald, Region 3 Safety Officer.  I have talked with him and he is awaiting this document.","06/26/2003 00:00"

Leaving the station, I contacted Phoenix Dispatch on my truck radio and told them I was enroute. I also told them to call engine 241 and give them a heads up. At this time radio communications were good. I was able to talk to our dispatch and they could talk to me.

At 0950 I could see the smoke about 2/3 of the way up the side of the music mountains. Thinking that there may be a road leading to the fire, I tried to contact Phoenix on our Simplex channel to have them call the crew off engine 267 and have them bring our 4 door chase truck (most the roads in this area are too rough for engines, so my plan at this time was to possibly shuttle people to the fire in the chase truck). I was unable to contact Phoenix Dispatch on Simplex, so I switched to Mount Lemon Repeater and still was unable to contact Phoenix. As I moved north, I tried to us our Perkins repeater with no success. I was told later that the Perkins repeater has been down for some time.

The radio problem has been a constant battle in the past, so we have gotten into the mode of using our cell phones. The problem with this is any tactical decisions made over a cell phone is only going to be heard by the people involved in the phone conversation. Another problem was at this time the cell system was having problems. I tried to call Phoenix Dispatch on my cell phone between 0950 - 1200, with no success. I also tried to call the Kingman Field Office, and the Fire and Aviation Facility at the airport in hopes that I could talk to them and they could relay messages to Phoenix for me. However all attempts to anyone over the cell phone was unsuccessful.

I tied in with engine 241 and an Initial Attack IC was determined. We worked our way to Black Rock springs, where the road ended, and hiked into the fire from there, trying along the way to make contact with our Dispatch. All attempts were still unsuccessful.

At 1204 we arrived on scene of the fire. We were high enough on the mountain range at this time that we had direct line of sight with Kingman and the IC was able to contact the Kingman Field Office. We finally had established communications. The IC had to have the Kingman Field Office relay any information to our Dispatch.

At 1500 we got another start two drainages to the west of us. The new start was lower in elevation, so communications between us and Kingman would have been non-existent. The IC ordered a human repeater to come out so he could relay messages from the human repeater to the Kingman Field Office and finally to Phoenix Dispatch.","We need to take a serious look at this issue and find an immediate solution to mitigate this problem. Good radio communications in any fire program is not only basic firefighting procedure, but it is the backbone of the operation. Without this we cannot effectively do our job. We are, and have been well aware of the problems with our radio system. It is to the point now, when we leave this office we plan on either not having any communications, or losing it sometime during the day.

This poses serious problems when trying to size up the fire, order resources, or in this case communicate new starts in the area, which could pose serious threat to firefighters in this kind of terrain. Not to mention the problems faced if there were to be some kind of accident and no way to contact anyone.    All personnel that were on this incident could talk to one another on the radio, so this was not a problem.

When the IC finally established communication with Kingman, he did an excellent job in ensuring that we would keep them.

At around 1630, the IC could talk with Phoenix Dispatch on his radio, and he kept our human repeater in place in the event that the radio system went down again.","05/02/2003 00:00"

The potential effect of failure during critical operations is not worth the risk of 'testing' the equipment.","Develop a comprehensive testing program before large-scale purchase and certainly use of Project 25 portable and mobile radios.

Twenty personnel were on site and tasks involved firing out perimeter of burn area to secure a black line. Terrain was ridge tops to bottom drainages. Personnel were broken down into smaller squads to conduct burnout in separate sections of burn area, while I stayed mobile within the burn unit to conduct operations. All squads had portable radios. Radio coverage here on the entire Forest has been very bad for the last two years and is still getting worse. It is difficult to reach repeaters, difficult to reach district office, difficult to reach Dispatch office, difficult to reach truck-to-truck or portable-to-portable. Cell coverage is also limited. At the time of the burn, I had radio contact established with Big Swag Helibase as a back up. On the burn, we were operating on Fire Tac ch. 13. We could not talk to each other at times, even within .25 miles. I kept one individual up on the ridge till midway through the burn for relay, but this was still intermittent. Even my truck radio transmitting to portable on ch. 1, 13, 14 was not getting out. I was depending at times to use the Helibase to relay. There were times when I did not have contact with individuals on the burn during operations. We had heavy fuels, people sectioned out over portions of burn 2-3 miles apart. If an accident occurred, I may have not known about it until radio communications were established. Communications were essential to safe operations and I did not have the necessary link. It has been reported several times by me and other folks about the radio problems on Forest. A team has been studying ways to correct this but, at this point, it needs to be fixed immediately. At times, I had to drive over to a section on burn and talk with an individual face-to-face when radio communications broke down just to be sure we were talking about the same thing.","Better radio communications on Forest would prevent the above incidents from occurring.

The old chassis had a new model 52 pump unit installed on the existing bed five months ago.  From then, the vehicle's handling capabilities coming down hills have become difficult and frightening.  The vehicle has been down and out of service for an average of three times a week for the past month (June).  The vehicle has been taken to local and out of town dealerships to determine problems that the vehicle encounters.  Problems that occur range from vehicle dieing out unexpectedly, draining of a 24-volt system (draining the batteries), radio shorting out (communication radio), the vehicle's turbo not working on occasions, to the vehicle's tachometer not working at all.

This brings a big concern on a vehicle that is supposed to be ready at all times for initial attack of wildland fires.  This equipment and it’s crew should be safe and in working condition as soon as they roll into an emergency situation.","I have suggested, paying the remaining for the vehicle (1 yr. remaining) and replacing the chassis with a new and reliable chassis that can withstand the weight of the new slip-on unit.  Existing chassis is a one-ton chassis.  Replacement chassis is outfitted with a 1-1/2 ton chassis.

This individual traveled on 2-26-03 and returned on 3-30-03. He had taken one day off on 3-10-03. This was day 12. There was then a request by the IMT that he request from his supervisor permission to extend his assignment. He did this and received permission to do so. The employee then worked an additional 20 days. This included traveling home.

I have a number of concerns with this event:

1) A continued lack of understanding by employees/supervisors on the interpretation of the work/rest policy.

2) Misinterpretation by IMTs (He worked for 3 IMTs) of the work/rest policy.

3) A differing viewpoint between GACCs of this policy. R8 was OKing extensions while R3 adhered to a 14 day assignment and then home.

4) The employee felt pressured to get the work done or else be reprimanded.

5) This incident was not an emergency and an individual was pushing the limits.

This individual was very ill when he started home and slept in the back of his vehicle. We/he was very lucky that he was not involved in an accident resulting from fatigue.","I feel that the new direction provided by NWCGs letter of March 11, 2003, Work/Rest Guidleines and Length of Assignment, will help smooth some of this out.    I talked with the employee about this situation and our concern from the forest with his safety and that of others he was working with. I explained to him that he doesn’t need to be concerned about refusing to do something that is outside of policy or that he feels is unsafe. I also expressed my concern with his 'can do' attitude and that things will not change unless all individuals involved will make them change.

I have a concern with 3 IMTs being involved with this event and the employee did not have an understanding of how long he could/should stay before being demobed back home. Did the IMT pass this information on to the incident employees? Why didn't this get caught in timekeeping?

I talked with our GACC about this and they felt it was their fault for not catching this quickly enough and getting the employee home sooner. I told them that it's the employee's responsibility as well as their supervisor's and the IMTs. Maybe by attaching the work/rest policy to the resource order would help things out, especially traveling to another GACC or if there is a difference between GACCs.

I also briefed the Assistant Director of Operations, A&FM, and R3, of this situation. He was on his way to attend an Operations meeting in Boise and was going to address this issue at the meeting.

This employee's supervisor will be briefed on the forest's concerns and also educating both supervisor and employee about the interpretation of the work/rest policy. All of the forest employees will also receive a letter addressing this issue.","04/15/2003 00:00"

This incident was managed by FEMA with a type 2 Team assigned in Nacagdoches, TX. The first two objectives listed in the IAP were '1. Ensure safe operations for all incident personnel. 2. Search all areas specified to standards established by NASA.'

During the 2/25 morning briefing, the Team said they had a revised weather forecast which was slightly worse than that listed in the IAP. They were calling for max. temp. of 40 with 10-15 mph wind and an increasing chance of sleet. Rain chances were 40% increasing to 70%. It had already been raining for about 5 hours by the time briefing started. The Team said that we were going back out that day.

About 5 days previous, my crew had worked 2 1/2 shifts in almost constant rain (including driving rain) in temps about 10 degrees warmer than the current forecast. Despite protective gear, all crewmembers got extremely wet due to the rain, high RH, sogginess of the soil, and the type of vegetation we had to go through. We had one case of hypothermia and over half the crew had colds/bronchitis/flu. Other crews were suffering similar ailments and some had been quarantined. During these shifts, we also observed that our performance declined due to crew discomfort, poor visibility, and the fact that everything on the ground was now shiny with rain, making it hard to find the smaller shuttle debris.

After the briefing, I tried to talk with several of the overhead team members about my safety concerns. I was cut-off and told that safety had said we could go out and that we will. I tried again, and was again interrupted and told 'We WILL complete this mission by April 1.' Although this statement was not listed in the IAP objectives, it seemed that it was the overriding factor in the decision to go out that day. The IC also told me that he already had enough trouble getting people to work out in that weather and that he didn't need me stirring them up.

We sometimes work in the snow and rain on fire assignments. The benefit of fire suppression while working under those conditions outweighs the increased health risk to the crews. Working in the weather conditions of 2/25 had a negative affect on the first two objectives listed on the IAP and had no positive affect on any of the IAP objectives.","The recovery of shuttle debris is one of national importance and a 'can do' attitude can be useful in accomplishing that mission. However, management needs to remember the commitment to the safety of those people working for them. By being out in those weather conditions, we were not saving lives or property. It would not have hurt to hold the crews back until the weather improved.    I tried to resolve the problem by discussing it with some of the overhead team members. They did not seem receptive to my comments.","02/27/2003 00:00"

We were in territory not seen in daylight (though there was good moonlight). The area had a lot of beetle-killed pine.

The (approx. 3 acre) fire had been of low intensity in most areas, having burned leaf litter under which was moist duff. Some slopes still had a light covering of snow. There had been some hotspots during daylight. Part of the area we were working had burned intentionally and intensely--crews clearcutting a home site on private land had apparently been burning brush piles.

At 2200 hours, the line on most of the fire was cold and there was little fire activity in our area. Some of the fire had simply burned itself out without a constructed line due to leaf moisture.

The other firefighter was assigned to work a hotspot near the line about 100-150 yards from my location and away from the intensely burned area. While working the hotspot, a snag from inside the fire fell near her. My understanding is that she could hear it but could not see where it was coming from. She was not injured but was shaken. I did not see the snag but from the sound of the landing it had the potential to have been fatal.","This was a situation in which the burn intensity (aside from the brush piles) was low. There was constructed line around portions of the fire. In portions where there was no constructed fire, the line was black and cold (and in some areas near a light covering of snow.) At the time of the fall, no line was threatened, there was virtually no chance of fire escape (winds forecast at <10 mph and humidity forecast for 30-70%) and there were few interior hot spots.

On the positive side, the other firefighter also had a radio and was close enough to me that we could communicate by voice (and I could determine she was unhurt.) Had she been hurt, we had radio communications to call for help.

After the snag fell (and after the IC had been informed of the fall) the other firefighter was instructed to 'drag a rake' along the line (to create degree of a constructed line.)

We (and later other crewmembers) continued to work in the dark in an area known to have beetle kill and with a history of at least one snag fall.

It's my belief that the fire was virtually controlled at the time and constructing line along cold, black line was unnecessary, especially in light of the snag fall.    IC was informed of snag fall. Prior to going off duty at about 2330 hours I reminded the IC of the potential danger of snags in the area.

I'm not faulting the IC. However, I think there is a common tendency on small fires to have initial attack crews 'secure' the fire with a constructed line as well as mop up interior hotspots. In this particular instance, I think the fire was basically controlled and the risks involved in improving the line and/or mopping up interior hotspots far outweighed the gains to be made by that work.

Perhaps we need to accept that night crews should be assigned to MONITOR the fire as opposed to WORK the fire when the threat from the fire is low.

I should add that a different firefighter had earlier raised with me the issue of snags, having recently completed the annual firefighter refresher at which this was discussed. Despite that notice, I had not myself given sufficient thought to the danger.","02/14/2003 00:00"

SCA has allowed the environmental compliance officer to act as the official Acting FMO, for the agency.

Any FMO position requires that the person performing as FMO meet prerequisites, and classification standards. NIFC has created position descriptions on a national level that are signed by the Secretary of the Interior, who then requires Regional Directors and superintendents to implement as policy. The Acting FMO for the Southern California Agency currently holds FFT-2 qualifications.

This can be a serious issue given the complexities of fire in Southern California and the amount of Inter agency Resources assigned to any BIA incident.

The idea of putting a FFT-2 as an FMO will lead to accidents and the potential for serious incidents.

An FMO must be at least ICT-3, DIVS, STEN, RX2 qualified, so as to better fulfill there responsibility on trust lands and to help cooperators make use of tribal recourses on reservation lands and help identify fire related issues.

As a FFT2 there is a lack of understanding fire behavior, which can have a negative effect on operational decision making.

How can the BIA allow a FFT-2 be FMO?  There is no fire experience or knowledge.","Place only qualified FMO or AFMO in role, as it is required for any Fire Management position that is held at the 0462 series to have experience and certification.

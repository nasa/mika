We had a 30 to 40 minute drive back to station at speeds between 15 to 25 on fr132 and 45 to 50 for the last 10 minutes of the drive. We then let the engine idle for around 20 minutes while we restocked and filled the engine. We then drove at speeds above 30mph for an additional 40 minutes in order for the regeneration process to complete.

According to the vehicle owners guide and a Ford supplemental publication, the engine can tolerate up to four hours of operating conditions under 30mph for at least 20 minutes before the 'reduced engine power' message displays. Once that happens, if the filter cannot be cleaned, the engine power will be further reduced and the motor will require dealer service in order to run at full power again.

Although this particular incident was mearly an inconvenience, frequently there are situations that we operate the engine under 30mph for more than four hours. For instance travel on long dirt roads, or if idle is necessary for extended periods of time on an incident. As referenced in Safenet ID # 7LPSZSSAFE if this power reduction happens at an inopportune time such as the need to get to a safety zone where time is a critical factor, this could jeapordize the safety of the engine crew.","I agree with the corrective action in the above mentioned safenet, the removal or modification of the DPF.

Once the area of the pile has been treated with the fuel and all personnel is away from the pile, one person using an ignited drip torch would ignite the dry pocket treated with fuel.

Fuels Tech #1 (FT1) climbed on top of a pile pouring an estimated 2 gallons of slash mix into an identified dry pocket, tossed the emptied fuel can about 30 feet from the pile and began to climb down. As this was happening, Fuels Tech 2 (FT2) turned his back to the pile and attempted to light the wick on the drip torch using a cigarette lighter. As the lighter ignited there was a flash of fire that appeared to observers to be a line of fire that moved away from the drip torch and then swung back into the debris pile. This burning arc was later paced and estimated to be about 30 linear feet. When the fire reached the debris pile there was a loud explosive sound and a ball of fire came out of the pile and wrapped around the pile edge.

The timing of lighting the drip torch happened when FT1 was descending the side of the debris pile. Looking down toward the ground, FT1 saw the first flash of fire and increased speed to reach the ground quickly. Part way down FT1's foot slipped. Not wanting to fall FT1 jumped, landed off balance and fell face down to the ground. Landing in a pushup position FT1 was attempting to get up when noticing fire coming in underneath. FT1's head was tipped back to protect eyes and airway when the fire flashed over. The crew leader immediately noticed 1st and 2nd degree burns to FT1's face and followed the medical evac plan.

The slash mix utilized in this operation was reported to be mixed at 1/3 gasonline to 2/3 diesel, or a 1:2 mix ratio. There was no method used to determine actual measurements of the slash mix.","Discontinue use of slash mix pooling in dry pockets of debris piles. Slash mix proportions must be measured and not estimated. Develop systematic approaches to project tactic that will assure employee safety is of highest priority. An example would be to not start any sequential action until all empoyees are accounted for and safe before igniting any prepositioned fuel.    Dry pocket igntion is no longer an accepted method of ignition, we are currently seeking alternative sources of ignition such as using a terratorch or propane torches for lighting piles, or covering sections of piles to create natural dry spots that can be ignited with a drip torch. Seek out training for and review S-234 guidelines. SOP's have been developed to ensure proper measurements and mixing of drip torch fuel.

This consisted of driving repeatedly up and down a hill with a observatory at the top. Elevation from top to bottom was approximatly 500 feet. After the eighth plus trip to the top and back down, Engine 71 upon turning around in a dirt parking lot, the vehicle's engine powered down and with the accelerator pushed to the floor board, Engine 71 barely had enough power to turn a full circle. A yellow inverted triangle icon appeared on the instrument panel. This particular icon appeares in conjunction with the new regeneration procedure on late model diesels. Engine 71 is a 2007 MaxxForce 9 7400 cab and chasis and has not 'regenerated' to my or the engineers knowledge. We feel that our vehicle was entering into this 'deisel regeneration cycle' during an inoppertune time. We did turn off the vehicle's engine for approx 5 minutes and when it was restarted, there was no more problem since that time.

I feel that an inoppertune time would include a need to get to a safety zone. These escapes should be timed and even 2 minutes could be life or death. The regeneration process for some vehicles can take up to 40 minutes is what I am hearing.

I feel this 'regeneration cycle' will at some point in the future cause harm to firefighters.","Remove the regeneration cycle from emergency vehicles, have it engaged on our terms every few monthes????

The regeneration cycle will probably go off during a critical firefighting event and cause a great deal of harm to the vehicle occupants and vehicle, itself. I am hearing/reading this powering down will affect or even turn off the vehicle's ability to run the PTO the provides power to the water pump. A fire engines main priority is to deliver water to the fireline and with these new 'environmentally friendly' vehicles, that water delivery may not occur and possibly cause the death of firefighters if no water is flowing because of the regeneration cycle.

We had gone through several loads of drip-torch mix. Towards the end of the burn we had ran out of drip-mix. An engine from another line had droped off their torches when they went get water, so we could finish our burn. The drip torch that I ended up with had a very cold mix in it (too much diesel). the wick on it kept blowing out with the light breeze.

On September 18th the Pleasant Valley IHC assisted in the operation. On September 19th two engine modules and three IHC crewmembers were utilized in this operation.

On September 19th 10 personnel from the district left the district office at 0820 and arrived at the staging area at 0900 and awaited escort into the site by law enforcement personnel.

At 0945 the LE&I escort arrived and lead the crew into the site. The crew was equiped with; 1 chainsaw, 1 dolmar of saw gas and bar oil, and 10 full drip torches as they hiked in.

At approximately 1000 all of the firefighters were in site. At this point groups separated to burn piles at different locations.

The crews burned piles from ~1100 to 1145.

At 1145 the firefighter who had been carrying the dolmar went to ignite a pile. He had been carrying the dolmar with the use of a tool over his shoulder and during this process fuel had leaked from the dolmar onto his clothing. While using a drip torch to continue to ignite the pile fuel from his drip torch may have contacted his pant leg. The fuel that had leaked from the dolmar then ignited. The firefighter dropped the drip torch he was using and attempted to extinguish his pant leg. The individual suffered a burn to his lower right shin.

The crew leader called for an EMT to evaluate the burn. One of the IHC lead crewmembers and the other engine module leader responded to the site and found the injured crew member sitting down, cooling the burn with water. They evaluated the extent of the injury and provided treatment. Due to the remote location the injured firefighter hiked from the site and was transported to the nearest emergency medical facility in Payson. The individuals’ injuries were treated and he was released from the emergency room that evening. The injured firefighter received further treatment at the Burn Center in Phoenix the following day.","The injured firefighter carried a full dolmar of fuel and bar oil on a tool over his shoulder.

This incident resulted in the UTV resting in an off-cantered, nose down position in a ditch while flame front passed resulting in heat damage to the driver side of the UTV.

Immediately prior to the incident, two Engine Module leaders (EML’s), a Firing Boss (T) and a Holding Boss, were in the UTV. The two EML’s were approximately 100-150 yards upslope of the three hand lighters. The Firing boss (T) shot three vari pistol rounds into a drainage ahead of the hand lighters. The holding boss was driving the UTV; meanwhile the hand lighters were below continuing to light across the slope. The firing boss asked that the hand lighters stop lighting. No response was given and another call was not made at this time.

The Firing Boss (T) had just completed shooting three rounds and was driving the UTV back to get in front of the hand lighters. As the UTV approached the lighters, approximately 20-30 yards away, the fire was moving faster than the UTV could get through the ditch. This is when the UTV got stuck. Both Firing Boss (T) and Holding Boss felt the only other option was to drive through the flame front (flame lengths were 2-3 ft tall) and both Firing Boss (T) and Holding Boss felt it was determined that this was not a safe option.

Immediately after the UTV was stuck both Firing Boss (T) and Holding Boss tried to free the UTV unstuck by rocking it, after trying unsuccessfully, the Firing Boss (T) and Holding Boss grabbed their PPE (line gear) and got out of the way of the flames, During this time the Holding Boss made several attempts to make contact with his holding resource. Holding resources were engaged on moving a truck, which the hand lighters drove to the original ignition spot, to a safer area. The Firing Boss (T) called on the radio and was successful on getting a response from one of the holding resources. After the flames passed over the UTV the Firing Boss arrived and tried unsuccessfully to get the UTV out of the ditch, then realized that the UTV wasn’t in AWD. The Firing Boss then engaged the AWD and successfully drove it out of the ditch.

Neither the driver nor the passenger of the UTV was engaged in fire suppression activities at the time of the incident.

There were no injuries incurred by the driver, passenger, or any other personnel as a result of this accident.

NOTE: This incident summary is compiled from statements of witnesses and personnel involved","The Firing Boss (T) and the Holding Boss should have not been engaged in lighting fire this may have been a causal factor in the events that led to the incdent

The Firing Boss (T) and the Holding Boss should be in separate vehicles. So they are able to manage their resources in the right ways.    Prior to ignition, all firing and Holding resources should be familiar with the area that they will be working.

IF a radio message is given, the sender must ensure that the intended receiver got and understood the message. Don’t assume that people heard your radio transmission.

During prescribe burn with the use of UTV or ATV needs to be scouted a day or two ahead of time so both holding and firing knows where all these ditches are.

During briefings, the FIRB should brief his /her resources, and the Holding boss should brief theirs.

Make sure everyone has a handtool with them.","09/19/2008 00:00"

The disk line also made access to the fire difficult.

My concern is that the land owners put themselves in harms way. They did not have the consent and did not let the IC know about there actions on state land. They also added one more thing for myself to worry about, taking my attention away from the true incident.

The Cotterel Fire started around 1130 off of Hwy 30, 5 miles east of Delco ID.

Handing you a Datron instead of a King is like handing you a shovel instead of a pulaski-- it's just another tool for the job.' He then went on to provide some useful information as to how to get along with and care for, and use the Datrons... And by doing so inadvertently highlighted some of the reasons why these radios should NEVER be issued to line personnel. Here's my problem with handing out Datrons, Racals, and Vertex radios for line personnel. Handing out an unfamiliar radio to a fireline supervisor is NOT the same as handing out a pulaski instead of a shovel. We all know how to operate a shovel and a pulaski safely, efficiently and effectively. Most of us do not know how to operate a Datron/Racal/Vertex effectively or efficiently. We may know one but not all three. It is unreasonable and unsafe to expect a line supervisor to learn the ins and outs and tricks of a new radio while in the fire environment... how to scan, set priority, build a scan list, turn on the backlight, etc. etc.. When it's time to talk it's time to talk, not mess around with learning the controls on a new radio. COMMUNICATION is compromised. In addition to the fact that many of us are unfamiliar with the operation of these radios, the radios themselves have some features which make them particularly unsuited for fireline use. Racals eat batteries and when on the AA battery pack they automatically and unreversably drop transmit power from 5 watts to 2 or 2.5 watts. It's like having your King radio stuck on the low power setting all the time. Obviously this reduces the transmit range of the radio. The Racals have no face protection so buttons are easly pushed by accident. Racals also have buttons w/o labels so it is very difficult to determine which buttons do what. Datrons and racals both have HUGE AA battery packs. I could go on and on. When will we see these on-going radio issued resolved and the radios that don't measure up removed from fireline service? Why were Datrons, which usually show up on fire strictly in the logistical support role around fire camp sent out for use on the fire line? It's hard to believe that R6 cache or BIFC cache did not have a box of Kings available given the low number of project fires going at the time.","Limit the type of radios issued on fires for fireline use to one or possibly 2 types. That way personnel could become familiar with a reasonable number of radio types in the off season if necessary. As it is now with King, Vertex, Racal, and Datron there are too many types to become familiar with and retain the knowledge if not used frequently. Eliminate from fireline service any radio that is not capable of transmitting with at least 5 watts of power while running on it's AA battery pack.    I have a home unit issued King and will keep it. As far as resolving the issue on the Rattle fire .... what could a FELB do about it? As far as crummy radios on fires... It seems like just about everyone who got issued a Datron or a Vertex or a Racal over the last 6-8 years has been unhappy about it and nothing has been done about it to date. Bigger fish than me have complained about it at length and still no results.","09/22/2008 00:00"

When I arrived at the parking area I had a converasation with Div A on Tac 1 about the snag hazards in the area of Pine Bench from the Spring fire in 1996. I told him the old snags were very weak and that we had had several close calls in the area a week previous due to tops blowing out from the wind. The predicted winds for the day were up to 15 mph out of the NE. He stated he was aware and wanted to tie in with us. I didn't like the idea of the crew doing downhill line construction with fire below so the crew tied into the road and started constructing line uphill towards another IHC crew coming down. Myself and one Squadboss walked up the trail towards Pine Bench to meet with Div.. We tied in with him on the trail and I again expressed my concerns with the snags up on top with the predicted winds. I told him that any wind in the 5-10 mph range was a huge watchout due to the rotten nature of the tops, I also reiterated our close calls in the area before. He responded that he had personally sounded all of the snags in the area and that the bases were all sound, I stated that it wasn't the bases but from halfway up the trees were weak and that the professional falling teams on the incident had concerns about cutting the. He then replied that he had been doing this job for 43 years and that it was a dangerous job and that we just had to get in there and be aggressive and get the job done. My squadboss and I scouted the proposed area and could see that his proposed line went right through a partially burned patch of snags from 1996, we didn't feel comfortable at all working in the area and decided there was more than enough work on the bottom of the fire to keep us busy for the shift. After talking with Div A again it seemed that he was in a big hurry to finish line and complete his burnout operation by the end of his shift so that he could go on and do a bigger burnout on the other side of his division. There was no real big hurry to get it done as most of area he wanted to burn was out. After walking away I told my squadboss that this Division just was not taking the dangerous nature of these snags seriously enough.","There were plenty of Professional Falling modules on this fire that could have been utilized to assess and remove the hazardous trees in the area. Div A could have listened more closely to our concerns and experiance with the snags in the area, we had been on this incident for three weeks at this point and had great local knowledge of the problem. There was no need to rush to complete operation as fire activity was very minimal at the time. Felt there was a lot of pressure from Div to complete assignment.","09/16/2008 00:00"

The only firing that was approved was for burnout operations associated with handline construction on the flank of the fire within his division. The DIVS independently took action by taking a crew downhill into a drainage and fired out in advance of the head of the fire without prior approval of Operations. This created a major safety concern. The crews assigned to the division were placed in jeopardy due to the fact that a downhill firing operation was initiated with disregard to access to adequate safety zones (safety zones were uphill), and the firing operation threatened the integrity of control operations.

In the Leaders Intent from the IC in the IAP for that day and days prior to this action read;

'The Klamath National Forests are supportive of the fire activity within the wilderness. It is at their guidance and direction that our operational plans are being developed. To accomplish these plans the actions need to be methodical and executed in the proper manner at the proper time. To ensure that this set of actions are carried out following the strategic plan, NO resource will commence any firing or burn out operations without the direct permission and concurrence of Operations. The only exception to this intent is in the event of a life safety issue.'

This action caused a complete revision of strategies and objectives. At the time of the incident the IMT was in conference with the forest staff due to the movement of the fire the day before.

When the trailer was picked up on 09/03/2008 the driver noticed the walls of the trailer where bulging and the load was one of the worst he had seen. Thinking the cache needed the equipment back in Lakewood, he hooked up to the trailer and pulled it back to RMK.

We began unloading the trailer on 09/04/2008 and the first thing we noticed was a strong scent of gas and fuel. Upon further investigation we found at least 3 fuel cans with fuel still in the containers, one of them having spilled on the floor. There was also a drip torch which was 1/2 full with drip torch fuel. The major concern were the 27 propane bottles packed loosley in the vehicle and about 10' from the back door. Twenty seven propane bottles requires the vehicle to be placarded. Upon even further digging through the trailer we were unable to find any type of manifest or Bill of Lading.

When the trailer was picked up there were no people from the team or the Forest at the camp. If the driver had been stopped and his load inspected without a shipping manifest or Bill of Lading his fine would have been huge.

A BIA Crew was sent to the incident as a Type II Initial Attack crew. The crews performance as a Type II crew was very good. However, they're were several things I discussed that caused a 'Red Flag' in my mind.

1) I obeserved that the Crew Boss was hesitant to break up the crew into modules believing this was inappropriate. Type II crew organization and performance was reveiwed with the crew boss who eventually consented to break up the crew for repair/rehabilitation assignments.

2) The ability to effectively use a hand held radio use by some of the squad Bosses was marginal.

3) It was determined that a valid drivers license must be issued to anyone driving a government vehicle in the 'BIA'. Not one of the crew members asked possed a valid government drivers license from the home unit and could not be issued a rental vehicle for work assignments. It became apparent that this crew did not function as a Type II I.A. crew at the home unit.

This appears to be a situation where crews are being given Type II I.A. status because of preference given to I.A. crews during crew mobilization within a given GACC or Dispatch Zone. Type II I.A. hand crews are more desirable that regular Type II hand crews. It appears that this crew was put together on an as needed basis and that crewmembers do not work togther at other times as a cohesive unit of individuals. Rather they are put together on a first come basis (?). This crew was not on par with Contract Crews who were listed as Type II I.A. and worked along side the BIA crew in terms of radio use and the ability to break up into modules and perform effectively. I would have been needed to assign a TFLD or STCR who was as an ICT4 to utilize modules from the crew for I.A.","The GACC or Zone Dispatch Center should contact the home unit for this BIA crew and inform them that this crew was not Type II I.A. capable. An independant review may need to be conducted to insure that the Type II I.A. designation given to the BIA crew is not for preference in crew dispatches.

We arrived on scene of the accident at 1930 hours, the accident involved two Montana DNRC engines staffed by local VFDs.

The flank they were working began to increase in fire behavior. They began to take action on the flare up with crews from E-1051 and E-603. After some Conversation between Division Group Supervisor and air attack they decided to put retardent along that flank. The division group supervisor notified them (E-1051 & E-603)and directed them to return back to their engines (that were stationed on the road) untill the retardent/air operation was completed. They returned back to the engines and tied in with Div. A and E-757 and continued to mop up the fire near the engines. As they were mopping up they were hit with the load of retardent from a P3 tanker, tanker 27. They knew that there would be air operations in the area, however they felt that they were not in the designated area for that retardent drop to go.

The assigned Timber Fallers were removing danger trees and snags in advance of line construction efforts. Positive and coordinated communication between Felling Boss and line personnel were established. Crews were disengaging as felling operations would take place in their vicinity. At this point all falling operation ahead of crews were being conducted as planned. Safety briefings during previous operational periods identified two tree length distance of all adjacent line personnel during cutting operations, and that no personnel would be engaged below the felling activity.

On the day of the near miss the Felling Boss was informed by the IC that there were some trees along the lower portion of the fire needing to be evaluated for soundness. The Fallers and Felling Boss moved up the hill to check these trees, and to remove any hazardous trees in that area. It was determined that four (4) trees needed to be cut, and the operation commenced as it had during earlier cutting missions with effective communications and a strong emphasis on safe practices.

This is when the Felling team encountered the final large tree to cut to complete the days falling assignment. Again, the Falling Boss inquired if crews were clear and was giving confirmation to proceed. The Falling Boss announced that the tree would fall back into the black not into the direction that the three previous trees had fell. Some crew members assumed the tree would fall in the same direction as the previous trees, toward the private land side of the incident. Instead, the tree had to be fallen in the opposite direction and much closer to the established fire line. This decision would prevent the tree from possibly sliding down the draw and out the bottom, which could have started additional fires. In the end, this tree landed where two crew members had been standing, and had to move quickly away to prevent being struck by a 170’ Douglas Fir.","The crew should have been instructed to move uphill to a safe distance above the felling operation as initially planned to allow for an extra margin of safety. Everyone involved needed to provide better communications and clearer instructions about the direction the tree would fall so each person was notified of the impending hazard prior to cutting the tree. If two tree lengths are not available between the tree being fell and the established fire line, all personnel adjacent, and downhill from the operation must have time to move above the operation, or establish two tree lengths by moving further into the green to provide proper distances from the felling operation. Ask if you don’t understand! Have good, clear communication at all times! Never assume which way a tree is being fell.    I talked to the crew the next morning on the fire line and asked them how they would have prevented this near miss. The feedback that they gave is that it would have been safer to be farther away from the tree being cut, and that an extra margin for safety is always important. They also understand never assume which direction a tree is being fell, and to seek clarification by asking questions and improving communications. I then talked to the Falling Boss and fallers about their near miss. By telling resources that the tree would be fell back into the timber versus saying it would fall into the black as indicated, would have given all involved a better understanding of where the tree was going to fall. This type of language would have improved the communication and understanding of those nearby and this tree was being directed into the area that hand crews had began mop-up operations.","08/18/2008 00:00"

She stated that she had been contacted by a local contractor saying that said firefighter had run the complete operation of a Feller/Buncher Group for several of the previous shifts, and that he, (the firefighter), was the only person that they would work with for on subsequent operational shifts. This particular firefighter had been told 2 days prior, and before going onto R&R, that he would be Demobed off the Engine to return to his District duties. The IA DIVS thinking this was an unusual request, told the OPSC(t) that the firefighter was only a first season Forest Service employee, and that it was more likely that the Engineer on the Engine had run the operation as he was the supervisor on the Engine assigned to the Feller/Buncher Group. The Engineer also had a degree in Forestry. The OPSC(t) was asked to take no action until the DIVS could get more information. While walking through Base Camp the IA DIVS was approached by the firefighter, who was off duty, and was not staying at Base Camp as he is a local resident. The firefighter told the DIVS that he was requested by Operations to return to duty the next day to work the day shift. The firefighter was told that this was not the normal procedure for assignment and that he was being Demobed off the Engine as he services were no longer needed in staffing the Engine.

On the next morning briefing (August 7th), unbeknownst to the IA DIVS, the firefighter was reassigned as a FFT1 to the Eagle Fire Assist Division of the Iron Complex which adjoined the Lime Complex's Minor Fire. The previous day the Iron Complex's Eagle Fire had escaped containment lines on it's West Flank. Due to other duties, the IA DIVS was unable to follow up with any action and went onto R&R days off.

On August 8th his relief IA DIVS (reporting party), realizing that the firefighter had been assigned to a sensitive and potentially hazardous portion of the fire that required a firefighter with much more experience and qualifications, contacted the Planning OPSC.IA DIVS told the Planning OPs that the firefighter was only a first year FFT2 working on an Engine in order to fullfil staffing needs and normally works on the local District. The firefighter's only experience had been working the previous month on an Engine. The Planning OPSC said he was unaware that the firefighter was not a FFT1 as indicated in the shift assignment sheet. It was agreed that the firefighter would be Demobed at the end of day shift.

During the Demobe of the firefighter that same evening the Engineer of an Engine who was assisting with the Demob was contacted by the firefighter's supervisor. The supervisor is a Staff Officer on the local District, and was assigned within the Finance Section on the Lime Complex. She told the Engineer that she had worked out a deal earlier, and to keep the firefighter assigned as a single resource using the Engine's 'E' number. The Engineer was told it would be okay and 'Not to worry'. The Engineer, knowing that it would not be okay continued with the Demobe.

Safety Concerns:

The Staff officer used her position of authority to get an inexperienced firefighter assigned to a critical position of managing the construction of a contingency line for 2 shifts. A contingency line that was adjacent to a line that had recently been overrun. The Staff Officer's actions directly jepardized the safety and well-being of the firefighter.

The Staff Officer's actions placed an unqualified individual into a position that, at the very least, should have required a DOZB qualification. His listing on the Division assignment as a FFT1 intimated that the firefighter had the knowledge and experience to be a squad boss on a wildland fire. These actions jepardized the safety and well-being of all individuals in the charge of that firefighter, as he had no experience regarding fireline safety protocals and recognition of potential blowup conditions.

Lastly. The Staff Officer at no time consulted with the local Fire Management Officers (Division Chief or Battalion Chief), thus circumventing policies established by NWCG and IQCS and resulting in compromising the safety and well-being of all firefighters assigned to the Division.","Imperative that Operations consult the Red Card Qualifications prior to assigning any task requiring supervisory positions on the fireline.

Don't short change the system for convenience.

Consult with local Fire Management who have personal knowledge of firefighter qualifications.    I advised the Planning OPSC of the firefighter's true qualifications.

I forced the issue of the firefighter's demob back to the District.

When I found out the Staff Officer was telling the Engineer of the Engine to let the firefighter stay on the fire, I told the Engineer that he was just Demobing the firefighter off the Engine. If Ops wanted to keep him they would have to place the order.","08/13/2008 00:00"

There were at least four (4) active Helispots on the Buckhorn Fire at any one time. Only one Helispot actually had any Helitack spike on site as Helispot Managers for days at a time. The other Helispots had no Helitack on site.

There were sixty-six (66),  Helitack personnel, excluding Overhead, at the Helibase everyday from July 24th through August 7th when I left the Incident. These people, for the most part, stayed at Helibase, with occasional missions to select Helispots for troop shuttles and the like, the same day and shuttled up and back to Helibase.  Except for the Helispot(s) already listed, there were NO Helitack on any Helispots performing as Helispot Managers to do sling loads. The sling loads were managed daily by Resources on the firelines. Everyday, when sling loads were requested, Helibase would inquire something to the effect of: 'Are there Helitack qualified personnel on site to safely accomplish the loads?' The answer was always affirmative. This is Helitack's job, not the Personnel on the fireline. I know of one DIVS that would hook up a slingload, then hike for an hour to another Helispot to get there in time to hook up another slingload. This is Helitack's job and is a distraction to a DIVS on an active Division. Helitack showing up on the fireline (1) without a tool, (2) with no IAP, (3) without having attended an Operational Briefing, (4) without all the required frequencies in all their radios, and (5) stating that the helicopter will come get them when asked what and where their Escape Routes and Safety Zones are. None of these are acceptable and warrant safety violations worthy of a SAFENET for each one.","* Reinstate the Helispot Manager position and training (S-356) immediately.

* Helibase Managers initiate, in every case, these Helispot Manager positions on Operational Helispots whereby they spike out on site, for days at a time, like the rest of us on the firelines.

* No more flying Helitack up to the Helispots in the late mornings and off the Helispots in the evenings. This adds to unnecessary exposure, cost, and a waste of our tax dollars.

* These Helispot Managers could also function as Lookouts, assist in Spike Camp Management, and assist on the firelines when there are no Helitack Operations.

* As a Fireline Supervisor, whenever Helitack arrives on your Helispot, always query them:

1) Did you attend today's Operational Briefing, not just the Air OPS briefing?

2) Do you have a current IAP or Shift Plan?

3) Do you all have the IAP frequencies programmed into your radios.

4) Do you have a tool?

5) Remind them that they are Firefighters first and Helitack second.

6) Brief them on LCES.

7) Brief them on 'The Operational Plan.'

8) Allow them to manifest or whatever their mission was once all this is completed.

South Canyon and Cramer Fires should be Lessons Learned for Helitack personnel regarding helicopters as Escape Routes and Safety Zones.

Air-to-Ground and Deck frequencies are unsafe and insufficient for Operational Helispot use.    Filing a SAFENET to draw attention to this long overdue problem. This wasn't only on the Iron Complex. This occurs on every fire anymore. As stated earlier, the IMT's and Helibase Managers have enabled this attitude and culture to prevail. It's time for a permanent change.There are a high percentage of Helitack personnel, stuck at Helibases, that would be more than happy to get up on the Helispots to efficiently and safely accomplish their missions.","08/15/2008 00:00"

To my knowledge the gas well sites were shut down and no gas employees were to be in the area working. We were all overcome by the smell of rotton eggs. I moved my squad away from the site out of the fire to get upwind. The terrain we were working on was pretty flat, so we had to move a little distance to get clear from the area. The wind was blowing 2 to 4 mph from the east toward us. The information I was given before leaving for this fire assignment warned that Hydrogen Sulfide gas had a rotten egg smell. I also know this gas to be deadly. No one on my squad was sick, but other adjacent squads had crew members become ill and vomit.","I was informed these gas sites were shut down. It was also understood that no gas company employees were to be in the area working. If the area was re-opened, the local land managers should have notified the crew. If this had been known we could have been out of the area when the venting occured. It could also be possible the gas company employees were not aware of the closure. In this case I would hope the local land managers would work on improving their hazard communication to the local gas & oil companies.    When the well site was venting we pulled out of the area and moved upwind to get clear of the gas. On the afternoon of 8/5 the local type three team left the fire. At that point there were no local fire personnel left on scene with knowledge of local policy.

I had the date wrong on the first one.

This SAFENET pertains to crew exposure to H2S gas on the Maverick fire on the 5th of August 2008. Prior to the incident, our crew was given sensors for H2S gas. There were many problems with low battery issues with the sensors, and eventually, they were just pulled off of the fire, because we didn't have the adequate equipment to charge the sensors. This was a major concern for me, as H2S is a very toxic gas. The exposure incident was as follows. Our crew had just taken over the fire from a team, and we were in a time of transition. My squad was assigned to grid division Bravo of the Maverick fire, which was very close to a pad for oil drilling. As we made our way closer to the pad, we saw several oil company employees driving towards the oil pad (we were not informed that they would be there, and we were under the impression that they would not be around). Several minutes later, we heard the sound of gas being released from the pad. Over the radio, we heard that the oil workers had released the gas without informing anyone on the fire. We continued our grid, and began to smell some sort of gas in our division. The scent was weak at first, but as we continued it became stronger, and we decided it would be best to pull out of that section. As we were hiking back to our truck, several of our squad members began feeling nauseous and sick. Our squad was moved to a safer location, and staged until they felt it was safe. I moved to the alpha division of the fire and helped put grass seed on a dozer line. Other squads, and a contract engine from Montrose were exposed as well. The main concern here is any long term damage done to our pulmonary systems concerning our lungs, heart, etc.","The first and most important thing that could help prevent this issue is communication between the oil companies, the team we took the fire from, and our crew.

Even if we had known that the oil workers were there, there was no communication between them and the IC, or anyone on the fire.

During those three days the sensors did not alarm of H2S, but the rechargeable batteries expired in the field on day three. Our crew was left to manage the fire and we continued to mop up. When hiking through the canyons the crew would experience a natural gas smell that would produce light headaches and nausea. After leaving the canyons the ill effects would decease.

The individual that was injured was an employee of the California Conservation Corps and was engaged in rolling hose, using a gasoline powered hose roller.

The injury occurred when the employee attempted to turn down the throttle on the gasoline engine that powered the unit. While reaching toward the throttle control his gloved hand became entrapped in the pulley and belt system, resulting in the index finger and middle finger on his left hand being slightly injured. His hand was freed only when another employee cut the belt off with a box cutter.

The hose roller being used was ordered through the cache system and is one of several designs that are in use and ordered under the same NFES number, 0665, which has a description of 'gasoline hose roller'. The machine involved in the accident is shielded on one side only, leaving the other sides open to the internal belt/pulley system.","Corrective action would be to install more shielding or remove the unit from service. There were other gasoline powered hose rollers being used at the same time at the incident which are designed with complete shielding and do not afford any chance for accidents of this nature to occur.

A possible redesign of the unit should be considered. As noted in the pictures, the on/off switch is located dangerously close to the drive belt. The gasoline engine that powers the hose roller appears to be newer than the rest of the machine which leads one to believe the engine has been changed out, possibly with an engine of a different configuration.

The DPA for the Owens Valley Interagency Communication Center(OVICC) runs along U.S. 395 from Topaz Lake, NV to Olancha, CA and from the crest of the Sierra-Nevada Mountains to the Nevada/California state line. The 395 corridor is favored by aircraft pilots flying from southern California into Nevada & visa versa. The Inyo National Forest also has a contract for one, type 3 Heliocopter to be stationed in Independence, CA and one seingle engine air tanker to be stationed at the Bishop Tanker Base.

The Dispatch center only has 1 qualified aircraft dispatcher and being interagency, we need to adhere to both Forest Service and BLM Policies.

First off, the TRAINEE Night OPS has a family relationship with a member of upper management on the IMT. There was no mentor Night OPS as oversight, supervision, and direction. Night Shift's Firing Operation during the prior Operational period (on or about 7/28/08) exceeded what Day Shift requested, which by itself was not a totally negative thing. However, due to the unexpected, additional Firing Operation results, (on or about) the 7/29/08 Day Shift had to hold line all day and was unable to continue to prep the steep handline down into a drainage and up the other side. (Division C was bisected by a deep drainage with roads on each side). On or about 7/29/08, the two IHC's were specially requested and reassigned from another Division to fire along paved FR 16 and down the handline 'into the hole,' somewhat like a split shift since it was late in the shift, at or about transition time. The two Supts. assessed the situation, successfully completed some of the FR firing, and turned down firing the handline portion based on several factors:

1) Semi-strong adverse, down canyon winds,

2) Handline was not sufficiently prepped with limbing, etc.,

3) Handline was not plumbed with hose,

4) Handline was only partly snagged,

5) Marginal Escape Routes and Safety Zones.

These Supts. refused the assignment based on Order No. 3 'Base all actions on current and expected behavior of the fire.' They stated that they could not accomplish the mission based on 'currrent' fire behavior and weather conditions, however, they felt that Night Shift would be able to take advantage of the 'expected' conditions to safely complete the handline and other firing after additional line prep.  I had also notified a Night shift IHC and a FIRB (T) on the south side of the Division that they had .6 miles to fire yet, with half of it needing prep, and I cautioned them not to fire because of the adverse, strong down canyon winds. The Night Safety Officer notified Night OPS by radio that the IHC's were refusing the assignment based on safety concerns. Night OPS immediately responded, 'WHY ... I'LL BE DOWN TO TALK TO YOU LATER.'  Based on the next day's briefing (7/30/08), Night OPS safely and successfully completed the Firing Operations. Did the Night OPS(T) notify the Night Shift resources that two IHC's had refused the assignment per the IRPG, turndown protocol? During the briefing, OPS pulled me aside and stated he heard I was privy to the two IHC Supts. refusing the assignment discussed above. I told him I was, and that I supported their decision based on fire behavior and adverse winds. He said they were going to meet with the IHC Supts after the briefing. This post-briefing meeting included OPS, Night OPS, the two IHC Supts., and Div. C SOF2. The Night OPS started the meeting very abruptly by pointing to one of the Supt. and accusing him of being 'a complainer, a whiner,' and something else, at least twice. She also accused them of 'stirring up' her Night Shift and also accused them of stating that the assignment was a 'death trap.' She said she had to spend 'three hours calming everyone down' before they could get any work that night because of the 'death trap' issue.  The Supt. explained his rationale; he stated that he 'turned down the assignment' due to 'current fire behavior' with an option for Night Shift to accomplish it later that night, based on 'expected fire behavior.' The Night OPS(T) blurted out - ' it wasn't a turn down.' The SOF2 said, 'excuse me, they refused the assignment as proposed to them, therefore, it was a 'turn down' according to the IRPG.'  Night OPS(T) again accused the two Supts., focusing more on one Supt., of 'complaining and whining and ...' while they were on the fire, a couple more times during the post-briefing discussion. The two IHC Supts. assured both OPS and Night OPS(T) that they never used the term 'death trap' in briefings, debriefings, or on the radio related to this assignment. The SOF2 later determined that the other Night IHC and FIRB(T) used that term on their own. Prior to the close of the meeting, the Night OPS(T) somewhat conceded that she needed to talk to her Night Shift personnel regarding this issue. Night OPS(T) also stated 'I hate it when people tell me something can't be done' at some point during the discussion.","I supported the Night SOF2 and the two IHC's that night and the following day in the post-briefing discussion.

Since being assigned to the incident I noticed a communication issue between the Day Operations and Night Operations. Several othe DIVS complained that they would come up with a plan for the next day operational period but then night operations would come in and start firing operations whether weather permitted or not. I heard DIVS complain about wrong pieces of line being burned, dirty burns being left with little to no consumption. When I asked why don't they take their concerns to Branch, I was told that would be as far as it goes. I was made aware that the Night Operation Section Chief has a family relationship with a member of upper management on the IMT and that no one on the team would complain due to fear of reprisal and that this has been allowed to go on for some time. This raises a safety concern when no one is able to raise concerns about tactics or safety because of the fear of reprisal. On one shift change I witnessed two Hotshot Superintendents turn down a firing assignment due to unsafe conditions. They explained that there was no safey zones, escape route was back up the line (uphill) on a handline with heavy canopy. The winds where blowing across the line at 10 mph with gust to 18. We could see a line of fire forming across canyon on the north slope. They gave options of falling back to the 3 blade dozerline a mile up the road or wait til' early morning and coming up from the bottom. This firing operation was to contain a spot that formed 1/4 mile ahead of the night shift firing, which also posed a concern to the Hotshots in regards to being committed on the handline. The Day DIVS asked the two Superintendents to brief the night DIVS of what they saw. Night DIVS agreed to their concerns and called the Night Operations the brief her. She stated in a rude tone that she would have her night crew make that decision. After that, it appeared the Night DIVS and Night personnel felt that even though the conditions where not right to burn, Night OPS would still want to burn regardless. The IHC Supt. asked the DIV Night Safety Officer to take a look at the line and what was being proposed. About ten minutes later DIV Night safety called the Night OSC and told her 'Do Not Put Fire on the Ground!'. Night OSC responded extremely rudely 'Why Not??!!' Saftey explained that it was not safe due to no safety zones, poor escape routes, the wind was in their face and fire behavior was pickig up. Night OSC rude response was 'I'll be up to talk about this!!' I could not believe the total disregard to safety concerns being raised by several competent folks. I heard that at the next moring Day Briefing, the day OSC and Night OSC took the two Hotshot Superintendents around the back of the brifing tent. The Night OSC screamed at the Superintendents in such a rage stating the they placed fear in her night DIVS and how dare they get the safety officer involved. I was told that they almost got sent home for this but was reassigned to a different part of the complex. I would expect more professionalism from someone in that leadership position. I found out later that the Night OSC was a trainee. This raises another concern. It appears that the Day OSC was her trainer yet he would transfer command to her at the evening. So who was out there with her as her trainer? Also, the Day OSC just got signed off as an OSC and was on his first assignment as an OSC. I believe the requirement for a trainer is that you have at least 3 assignments in that position before you can train someone else. Again, a blind eye turned away due to nepotism. I believe that if this Night OSC was on another IMT, this type of incident would never be allowed to occur.","A policy that would prevent nepotism within an IMT.    Remove the individual from the team and place on another IMT where nepotism would not be inplace and team members, fireline overhead could voice their concerns without fear of reprisal. Also, this would allow a fair performance rating on this individual without favortism or fear of reprisal if not a positive rating.

RP was assigned to the Ukonom Complex Wildland Fire as a Security Manager and arrived at check-in at 1000 hour on the 7/24/2008. He spoke with the current Security Manager and the USFS law enforcement Officer Patrol Captain. After reviewing the current staffing level and type of security, RP does not believe that security levels are antiquate to provide a safe working environment for security personnel or the all personnel assigned to the fire incident. He was to take over as the Security Manager on Saturday 7/26/2008, but was told on 7/25/2008 after making recommendations to the current Security Manager to DEMOB because he was considered excess. To RP's knowledge there is not a Security Manger in place for the transition.

Note: The current Security Manager has been driving home at night in a Rental incident vehicle about 40 miles away and providing no supervision or response to night security.

Because of the history of violence in the local community (with a shooting near the ICP within the last two days) and with long response times from the local county sheriffs department (up to 2 hours) the need for SEC1s is vital for safe completion of Security’s mission on the incident. Currently there is only One SEC1 assigned to the Incident.

There has been a history of anti-law enforcement policies by the IMTs during the Ukonom Incident. One being the command staff requested the law enforcement officer to conceal their weapon by covering it up while patrolling camp. This is a safety issue in its self and if a properly trained security manager had been in place, this would have not happened.

In RP’s Opinion he was asked to DEMOB because he was a U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement Officer (carrying Defensive Equipment). There was a need for Security Manager on the incident and due to the anti-law enforcement posture of the Incident Management Teams This is the real reason he was DEMOB.

As of 7/27/2008 there will be no Security 1, assigned to the fire except for a fire severity law enforcement office working for the district. There are also other equipment security issues such as the helbase, which is left unsecured at night and a patrol drives by every hour or so, but the equipment could be tampered with easy and I believe this is putting the pilots in danger. To RP’s knowledge no crews are sleeping at the helibase and there is no human presence during the night time hours.

The anti-law enforcement atmosphere with the Incident Management Teams in the Western Regions has been prevalent as RP has had issue with every type II team he has worked with over the last two seasons. This is a huge safety concern and should be addressed.

Those rappellers hiked out the next morning, so all of July 23rd we used Black Butte Lookout to relay info with dispatch. The lookout was concerned with us having no good commo during the night when she was out of service, and suggested we try using Odell Repeater, which was in a different group of frequencies than the one we had been instructed to use. Odell worked from a few locations near our fire, but we had to go back to using the lookout as a human repeater when we hiked out.

There is a dangerous lack of repeater coverage in an area that gets a lot of fires and public recreation.

This is a notification that a user has contacted the EUSC to escalate this ticket. As documented in the escalation procedures, your assistance is requested to drive this ticket towards resolution. This is a fire office and they are down to one mobile working radio, and that is all. The two consoles they have are not working and this increases the threat risk that this office takes in case of an emergency. The radio's were ordered back in May and they were told to have them by the end of June, however they still have no new radios.

Thank you,

-----------------------------------------------------------

Here is the reply :

---------------------

...submitted an order to replace your remote controls on 6/2/2008, our ISO ordering desk entered the order into IAS on 6/5/2008, the order was approved by CIO budget approver in IAS on 6/5/2008 and the order is now waiting on Forest Service Acquisition Management to place the order. Unfortunately these folks do not work for us, we placed this as an emergency order but they have taken no action on the request. When the replacements arrive we will take immediate action to reinstate service.

Well, like we have do do all the time now with everything, we simply try to piece together components from old stuff and try to figure it out for ourselves. In the 'old days' (5 years ago) we simply called our forest radio tech. He or she arrived within a day, and if they couldn't fix it, they quickly replaced it within a week. Now, we have to open a ticket and wait a week for someone to show up. Then, the 'ticket' is bounced around the agency from person to person until it lands at the 'Forest Service Acquisition Management' office, and we simply have to wait until they get around to doing it.

The decision was made to not continue burning operations due to terrain and location of the main fire. The weather was getting hotter and drier as relative humidities were in the teens. A noticable increase in fire behavior was observed and enhanced by terrain and local canyon winds. The main fire began to build and make an up canyon push, threatening our contingency line. I ordered all resources to begin moving out of the area as I believed the fire activity would continue to develop and soon spot across our line. Other spot fires were being reported on a section of line burned during the previous shift. The largest being a quarter acre in size. As the main fire spotted across our contingency line and continued to gain momentum I ordered all resources to move to the pre-defined safety zone. The safety officer made his way to the road junction down to the safety zone and helped direct resources in an orderly and calm manner. I contacted the Division trainee to ask if everyone was indeed moving to the safety zone and wanted him to also monitor our exit from the area. He passed a message from the Dozer Boss who wanted to know if he should remain in the area and go look at the spot fire. I relayed that I wanted all resources to report to the safety zone. Safety relayed that all resources were headed down the hill and he would be following them to make sure everyone was accounted for. I relayed to Branch and Operations that we were disengaging due to safety concerns. The Division trainee and myself remained in the area to monitor the fire's activity to try and better determine where it might be headed and what roads might be compromised. We then headed down to the saftey zone for a bebrief on the disengagement and fire activity with all division resources. I ran into Branch on my way down and we discussed the operation. As I was driving down to the saftey zone I came across the Dozer Boss and all of his resources in a different location. The Dozer Boss called to ask where I would like them to go. I relayed that I wanted all resources at the pre-defined safety zone. Once at the saftey zone, I spoke with the Safety Officer about our disengagement and he noted that all resources were accounted for except the Dozer Boss, three dozer operators and three lowboy drivers. The Dozer boss had decided to disobey the order of reporting to the safety zone because he felt the equipment would just clog up the area.","Follow direct orders from the Division Supervisor. Report to the designated safety zone.    During the Division debrief I recounted the fire activity and decision points for moving personnel and equipment off of the division in an orderly manner. I asked everyone if they understood where they were supposed to meet. I then asked if everyone reported to that location. The answer was no. The Dozer Boss explained that he indeed understood the order, but decided to disobey because he felt the amount of equipment would impact the saftey zone. He also felt that they were in a safe location and in no danger. The operators were following his orders. I explained that there was plenty of room in that area and that ultimately we need to have accountability of all resources. I explained that his behavior was unacceptable and grounds for being released from the assignment. He continued to deny doing anything wrong.","07/24/2008 00:00"

Safenet Narrative

Three items of concern occurred on the Gooding Gun Club fire. The following narrative will describe each situation.

The Gooding Gun Club fire, EB4M was a human caused incident that started on Tuesday, July 15 at approximately 16:00. The fire originated on private property and burned some BLM land. Final fire size was 450 acres. The sky was clear and ten MPH winds out of the west-south west pushed the fire over flat to rolling ground. The fuel was cheat grass with a heavy sagebrush overstory causing occasional flame lengths of ten feet. The fire had its head up and was running to the east. The south flank of the fire was held by railroad tracks. Irrigated farm land made a barrier that was forcing the head to move north into un-irrigated sagebrush country which would give the fire a long way to run if left un-checked. The north flank, from the heel of the fire east, was held by a two track, and the incident objective was to keep the fire from growing to the north. The engines, SEAT’s and two helicopters were doing a good job at stabilizing the incident.

The first item of concern occurred when a BLM water tender was staged in a green field and set up to refill the engines. At approximately 19:00, two male citizens approached the water tender operator, and one of the gentlemen was brandishing a hand gun. This person wanted to know who was in charge, and why were they not stopping the fire that was heading toward their wheat field which was almost ready for harvest. The water tender operator called the IC and requested law enforcement. The Sherriff soon arrived and removed the citizens.

The second item of concern involved the wheat field. Although threatened, it was not going to burn due to the expanse of irrigated vegetation that was between the wheat field and the fire. The fire went out before it could get to the grain. In addition to the green vegetation, several citizens were helping to protect the wheat field by putting a twenty foot wide disk line around the field. These citizens were aggressively trying to persuade an engine boss to attack the head of the fire before it got to the grain field. This forced the engine boss to use a forceful tone of voice to inform the citizens that we will not attack the head of a fire. The citizens later toned down their stance and eventually apologized to the engine captain.

The third item of concern involved the number of curious citizens that freely staged their vehicles in the middle of the rural paved county roads used to access the fire. The majority of the vehicle owners had departed their vehicles for a better view of the fire operations, effectively blocking the road for fire traffic. Although the local Sherriff’s department was on scene and the IC had communicated face to face with the Sherriff the need to clear the road, at least the roads leading to the scene of action, this never happened. Citizen traffic was a concern until the flame front was put out and the smoke cleared.","Suggested Corrective Action

Implement a substantial public information campaign focusing on the need for the public to stay away from wildland fire operations.

Implement a substantial public school information campaign that reminds students year after year of the need for the public to stay away from wildland fire operations.

Implement a substantial public information campaign focusing on the need for the public to maintain their private wildland intermix property in such a manner that it will be defendable in the event of a wildland fire.

Implement a substantial public school information campaign focusing on the need for the public to maintain their private wildland intermix property in such a manner that it will be defendable in the event of a wildland fire.

Work with county commissioners / state law makers to enact ordinance’s requiring citizens to clear roadways that are being used as fire suppression access during WUI fires.    Corrective actions taken.

For the first item, The Sherriff was contacted and the threat was removed in short order.

How can this safety issue be prevented in the future? The long slow process of public education should continue, and be ramped up, so that citizens learn to take responsibility for fire proofing their own property.

For the second item, the engine captain was put in a situation where he had to use the same tactics as the citizens. This is not the best case scenario, but it seemed to diffuse a bad situation. How can this safety issue be prevented in the future? Again, the long slow process of public education should continue, and be ramped up, so that citizens learn to take responsibility for fire proofing their own property. When people accept the responsibility for maintaining their property and improvements, they will not have to take such drastic measures when their homes are threatened by wildland fire.

For the third item, public education as well as the implementation of ordinances that allow law enforcement to fine offenders would be helpful.","07/24/2008 00:00"

My personal fire experence consists of 22 years in wildland fire,as a Firefighter, Squadboss, sawyer, C-Faller, Crewboss,Hotshot, Burnboss and Striketeam Leader Trainee.

I was dispatched to the Iron Complex on 7-8-08. My offical duty was as a crewmember on a National Park service Engine.

During this fire assignment, my personal safety was compromised by my Engineboss.

These incidents included, being asked to perform unsafe duties, such as lookout duty under a large patch of snags; being asked to assist in unnessery burnout opperations; unlawful search of my P.G. bag, and threats of being terminated.

The harassment and threats by the engine boss have been reported to my F.M.O.. But the FMO has taken no action in regards to these incidents.

I myself have been punished for reporting these unsafe practices. They include removal from offical duty station, and threats of having my own red card pulled if I reported these unsafe practices.

The first incident occured on 7-14-08 while assigned to Divsision-S, when I was intentionally placed as a lookout in a unsafe area, even after the engine boss was made aware of several large snags in the area. The engine boss threatened to terminate me, if I didn't take this assignment.

Next, on 7-17-08 the engine boss wanted to conduct a burnout of a safety zone, in the Bell Flats area on Divs.-S, eventhough the the Division was classified as 90% contained. I informed the Division supervisor that the engine boss's experenced level was questionable and that his Burnout was an unnessary risk too firefighter safety and proptery. At this time the engine boss became very irrate with and tried to provoke me into a physical conflict.

Finally, on 7-18-08 my personal gear was delibertly searched by the engine boss.  This was done without my consent and also without any legitimate reason.

The actual fireline experence of the engine boss as a suppervisor is at a FF-1 level. This is based on my own observations, experience and training over the past 22 seasons.

I would greatly appreciate any assitance in regards to these unsafe incidents, thank you.","Check into the engine boss's actual fireline experence, and make the fireline a more safe place.

Unit - Central Zone","Incident Commander","","4","Engines, Crews","Wildland;","Line;","Initial Attack;","Other;","Situational Awareness;","Gas and Oil Infrastructure","Upon arrival to IA# 224, which was in an area of heavy natural gas production activity, some of the gas and oil workers informed the Engine Module Leaders that there was a teflon valve that was heat sensitive within 200 hundred yards of the fires edge. The workers were somewhat concerned about fire impacting the valve. We later found out the pipeline only had water in it.

The second concern on this fire was the known possibility of H2S gas in the area. About an hour into the initial attack, the Incident Commander was notified of the well pads that had H2S gas on them as some, but not all, the pads have been mapped. The nearest pad was within 1/3 of a mile of the fire's east flank. This pad was in no way marked on site with any obvious warning signs or, as we have been told, these pads would at least have a wind sock. Later we found out from the BLM PET that these signs are only signed when H2S is at a certain level. This was of greater concern to us than the teflon water valve. The valve would have caused a mess, but the H2S was a serious health concern to the crews on the fire.

It was lucky that there was light wind at the time of the fire. If the fire would have moved to the south the fire would have burned in a area that had heavy fuel loading in a chimney. Located in this chimeny is multiple well pads(10-15), 2 active drill rigs were also uphill, and numerous oil and gas workers.","Continued mapping of all areas, federal and private, that are known H2S well pads. A push from the National, Regional and State Offices to assist in creating policy and procedures to transfer information from the oil and gas industry to fire organizations and to insure fire fighter safety. In areas where heavy oil and gas production is occuring, there needs to be adequate funds and fire staff to help mitigate all the issues the oil and gas infastructure is creating. This is a whole new Wildland Urban Interface(WUI) that has increased the complexity of wildfires on the Zone.    The issue with teflon valve was resolved by constructing handline and using SEATs to hold the flank that was pushing towards the valve. The fire ended up being 7.7 acres and with the few people on hand initially, this took a few hours. We do have decent mapping of pipelines in the area, but there are literally thousands of miles of pipeline in our zone and more being added daily and it is hard to keep up with. We, as a federal agency, only have pipeline data for federal lands. During initial attack, dealing with the gas and oil infrastructure and personel only adds to the complexity of the fire environment.

As far as th H2S concern, we resolved the issue by getting all personel out of the area and camping in a safer location where the possibility of pooling H2S was non existant. We also monitored winds and were in contact with the gas production companies as to the actual dangers of the H2S on the pads. Having funding for H2S monitors on the engines and trucks that respond to areas of known (or unknown) H2S would be a step in right direction of providing for firefighter safety. We need to continue to work with Energy Industry in identifying hazards.","07/21/2008 00:00"

Multiple ground resources have been complaining about certain frequencies locking up their mobile radios and just static coming out. This has been on-going for quite a long time. Help tickets to our radio shop only concluded radio interference issues or anomolies as a causal factor.

During recent Initial Attack several ground resources reported that our Primary Air-to-Ground assigned frequency (169.200) would lock the radio while scanning and the open squelch would cause interference with the command or tac frequencies. The solution in the field was to nusence delete the scan frequency, but that would of course force the resources to use their hand-held radios to monitor air-to-ground.

It has become evident to us that the BLM units using EF Johnson mobile radios have a known issue described as ''Birdie'' frequencies, that the radio causes interference with. These frequencies cause the radio to break squelch. I have since discovered that additional units with these radios have similar issues with ''Birdie'' freqs and have experienced communications safety issues also.","This seems like a preventible issue, had the folks in the know about the technical flaws in the EF Johnson radios distributed to field units and radio shops the information about these ''birdie'' frequency issue. I was told the manufacturer of the radios will not fix or address the issue. It makes me wonder why we would purchase or use these radios that have these critical flaws. This same issue has been reported by other users of this brand radio, and apparently is a known issue at the National Radio Cache in Boise.    On 7/16/2008 a request was submitted to the GACC freq coordinator for a replacement primary Air-to-ground freq. The freq request was granted. Now our radio techs have to reprogram 350 handheld and mobile units in the middle of the field season. This change also has a negative affect on all our nieghbors and cooperators.","07/17/2008 00:00"

He also informed us that we would not need to pack in any dolmars, and to just make sure that the 2 saws that we packed up were full, we did pack 4 small containers of full with us. When we reached the fire a sawyer went in before us and fell about 5 - 7 hazard trees. We proceded into the fire and began digging line wich was at around 30% complete. At around 1230 3 crew members and a squad boss trainee were asked to grid 100 yards above the fire for any spotting. They finished in approx. 45 min. There were no look outs posted and the weather was never breifed besides the report we recieved that morning. I do not believe that there was even a belt weather kit on site. After fire line was built the crew proceeded to dry mop the area. We had 2 blivets and a net of fedcos dropped around 1430. The wind statred to pick up in drafts for most of the day off and on, and at about 1830 we started reciveing very strong gusts of wind. Shortly after that a large spruce fell within our fireline about 90 feet from a mop up crew. We recieved no commuications after that other than to 'keep our heads up' during strong gusts. I requested that a sawyer drop a large dead spruce that my crew had been mopping up underneath. at around 1900 a thunderstorm moved directly over head. We had still not recived any other breifings and the wind had dramatically increased at this time. We were instructed to improve the fireline before we start our descent to the road. We could visibly see 2 live large trees (approx. 30-35') drop just outside and below the fire, where our escape route ran through. As we waited for our group to gather with their gear a very large live tree which was about 45' dropped over the fireline about 40 feet behind our crew. Where we had been improving our fireline less than 5 minutes before. As we made our descent down the hill, over 16 large live trees fell within 100 feet of our line, and many others were found to have fallen over our escape route. Everyone made it down without injury, and we had a short de-breifing in which our IC apologized for not getting us off of the slope earlier and that our breakfast and lunches would be at our campsite at 0600 hours. When we got to camp I pulled Support aside and asked to leave the assignment and given a ride back into Eureka. Support was very accomodating and took my request and relieved me from the crew.","I believe we should have been pulled off of the fire much earlier or at least after the first tree fell into our fireline. I believe that someone should have been taking the weather the entire day, and we should have been given breifings regularly, and that communication could have been much stronger. I fely very unsafe under the leadership that I received and made the choice to leave based on these statments. Thank you    I discussed everything that I have stated directly to my crew boss and to the Squad Boss Trainees and how I felt about the situation and how I believe that it could have been avoided. I also asked why our weather was not being taken.","07/11/2008 00:00"

Bachelor. The communication problems occurred during two wild fire incidents which were initial attacked by Central Oregon Helitack via rappel operations with 21HX. The first incident was #324 on 7/10/08, in Township 18S Range 8E Section 36 Subsection SW/NE, Latitude 43? 58’ 13” by Longitude 121? 42’ 41”. The Second incident was #380 on 7/21/08, in Township 18S Range 8E Section 34 Subsection NW/SE, and Latitude 43? 58’ 17” by Longitude 121? 45’ 14”.

Once arriving at both of these incidents in helicopter 21HX, outgoing radio communication in the aircraft to dispatch was difficult. While trying to inform dispatch of fire information and rappel operations, information had to be repeated, and at dispatch request, numerous channels were tried with the same lack of success. This caused both the pilot and spotter to deal with radio communication problems before going into rappel operations, and incidentally created more exposure time to the crew as a whole.

During both of these incidents I was the Incident Commander and once on the ground, when contacting dispatch through radio communications, it was near impossible to transmit a good message through the repeaters. The channels that were used without much success: Deschutes Bachelor, Deschutes 2 Lookout, and Deschutes 2 Direct. When using these channels, it is possible to hear dispatch without much trouble, but transmitting to dispatch was reported back as, “scratchy and unreadable”. Numerous attempts were made to find better locations for transmitting, i.e. higher vantage point, openings in the tree canopy, and ridge tops.

Due to the radio issues I was having 21HX relayed to dispatch for me, however they were only able to transmit a clear message when they neared the north side of Mt. Bachelor. When the helicopter tried to communicate with dispatch on the west side of Mt. Bachelor where my fires were, they had limited success in doing so, thus the helicopter had to fly back and forth from the North of Mt. Bachelor back to my fire, once again increasing exposure time to the flight crew and the ground crew. Eventually the helicopter was released back to Prineville Oregon.

In hearing these attempts, Round Mountain Lookout relayed to dispatch some of my transmissions, however, I could barely make out what Round Mountain was saying to me due to the incoming transmission being extremely scratchy and almost unreadable. Because of the bad radio communications, I tried to find alternative methods to solve the problem that was occurring. On the ground the only success I had informing dispatch about the fire information, was that of an occasional outgoing message that was received by dispatch through scratchy transmissions from me on the repeaters, Round Mountain relay, and the relay with helicopter 21HX.

If it had not been for these two fires being fairly inactive, with the only fire activity characteristics being creeping and smoldering, the fire crews would have had to disengage from suppression activities. During incident #380, I was also used as a relay for a rappel crew on incident #381 at the request of dispatch. Acting as the incident commander on #380 and as a relay for incident #381, with only marginally better success than #381 was having, I was able to communicate to dispatch information for both fires through numerous attempts, due to bad radio communications.

Another concern with the lack of good communication between dispatch and the fires was that of a possible medical emergency or injury that could happen during fire suppression. If this situation were to occur, it would take an inordinate amount of time to tell dispatch and get medical support in route to the fire.","The possible remedies that could mitigate this problem are as follows; post a human repeater acting as a relay in a location that could get clear communication. This would require waiting for a reliable resource to get to a good location and depending on many factors, could take a lot of time. The Second remedy would be to put a temporary or permanent repeater up that would be able to transmit and receive clear signals to and from ground personnel/aircraft to dispatch, possibly on the west side of Mt. Bachelor.","07/24/2008 00:00"

The crewmember was released from the hospital and worked at the San Carlos office the next day. The crewmember stated that he felt ill and told the SWFF Coordinator’s assistant that he wanted to be released from the assignment. She informed her supervisor. The crewmember stated that the supervisor told him that if he left this assignment, he might not be recruited the next time the crew went out. The crewmember interpreted this as a threat and returned to his crew. The supervisor stated to me that crewmembers that go home early from assignments are not eligible to go out on crews again until the original crew they were on is released. He also stated that the firefighters twist his words around and talked about the threats he has received from firefighters that he has disciplined. He also stated that he lets crew bosses pick their own crews. This last statement was contradicted by the San Carlos #12 crew boss. On July 8, the crewmember in question was with his crew on the Whiskey Fire. At ~1130 he complained of flu-like symptoms and was examined by an EMT assigned to be with the crew. The EMT recommended that the crewmember be transported to the hospital. I transported the individual to the hospital as well as another crewmember who stayed with him. It was first disclosed to the hospital on July 5 by the sick crewmember that before the assignment he had been bitten on the hand by a dog unknown to him. The conclusion by the examining doctor is that the dog needs to be examined or that the patient needs to get treatment for possible rabies.","This matter needs to be investigated further to determine when the crewmember started exhibiting symptoms, and what exactly was said by the coordinator to the crewmember. The crewmember also, reportedly left the Black Mesa Fire because of the death of a close friend.

The crew and dispatch leaders need to be counseled that if unforeseen circumstances cause a crewmember to be required to be excused from an assignment, that they need to be excused without prejudice or penalty. SWFF firefighters need to be advised that when they go out on assignments they are expected to be available for 14 days plus travel and that they should decline an assignment if they know that that may not be possible.

In doing so, we were exposed to poison oak almost every day resulting in 2 persons on the crew breaking out in a terrible rash. My concern is with how it was managed by the incident management team. The medical unit was not offering a lot of treatment for the rashs that had formed. And of the cream or soaps that they were dispensing, it was in very minimal quantities that were not adequate. One of the products that they were dispensing was Tecnu Extreme Poison Ivy Scrub. During my treatment of poison oak at my local emergency room, the attending physician told me that by using that scrub, it actually intensified the reaction and allowed infection to set in. In the doctors words, if I had done nothing for the rash it would have been better off than using Tecnu Extreme Poison Ivy Scrub. Because of the severity of the rash, I was on medical leave 6 days and on light duty for another 6 days resulting in my Type 3 Engine Mocule being out of service, which resulted in the other engine at my duty station being unavaliable for off-unit assignments. I believe that if the proper treatment of the Poison Oak were recieved at the incident, that would have allowed it to heal more quickly and less medical leave would have resulted.","Just the understanding that if we take a some time away from the fire and provide the crews with the medical attention they need, it will allow the crew to be more healthy and ultimatly resulting in better production rates and more avaliablity for the next assignment.

Finding nothing wrong with 431, the crew began to drive toward the Roswell Field Office. While driving 35 mph around an easy right hand bend on Picato Road, about two miles from Highway 70, the Engine Boss felt that the engine had blown a tire on the driver's rear dual. The Engine Boss maneuvered the engine, keeping off the brake, to the side of the road until the engine's forward progress stopped. When the uninjured crew exited the engine they found both tires on the driver's rear dually had come off the hub axle. Both tires were attached to the rim. One tire was found about two hundred yards off the road, in the weeds, on the opposite side of the road. The other tire was still on the engine but off the hub axle. After 431 was towed and repaired, the repair shop informed the Engine Boss that what led to the incident was that the hub pilots on the tire had not been properly aligned and centered when the field tire change was done on June 17, 2008.

Incident at a late hour. He was driving too fast on sandy, winding mountain roads in the dark in unfamiliar terrain. Not far from the incident, where the road curved, the fire manager's vehicle slid off the road, stopping on the edge of a hill with both driver side wheels off the ground. The fire manager tried to call someone from the incident on the radio, but the only person he could contact was the IC. He could not tell the IC where he was because he did not have a GPS unit with him. The fire manager ordered IC off of the fire to come and find him, in the dark. The fire manager got out of his vehicle and began to walk back up the road he'd come down, using only his headlamp for light. After a couple of hours of walking around, for about 3 miles, in what he believed was the direction back to the fire, the IC and one engine operator finally spotted the fire manager by seeing the headlamp on his helmet. They picked him up and returned to base, leaving the fire and the fire manager's vehicle behind.

Early the next morning, a new IC was appointed. When the new IC got to the ICP, it was abandoned. When the fire manager and engines arrived later, the fire manager ordered the IC and the engine personnel to assist him in getting his vehicle unstuck. When they finally located the vehicle, in the daylight they could see how close the fire manager had come to rolling his vehicle downhill. The personnel and engine were used to push & pull the fire manager's vehicle out of the sand and get it back on four wheels on the road. The fire manager threatened them if they told anyone about the accident.

Unbeknownst to the fire manager, two personnel took photos of the vehicle before it was rescued - one with a camera phone and one with a digital camera. Afterwards, when anyone at the compound mentioned the accident, the fire manager threatened them if they spoke about it.","This fire manager is unfit for his position and fire roles.

I have heard this from numerous long-term fire fighters in the South Central Oregon Fire Management Partnership. I have heard this from different people with experience levels ranging from 10 to 30 years as wildland firefighters. Both reviews seemed to be more intent on covering the individual incident leaders from recrimination rather than providing a good lesson for the rest of us so that these mistakes are not repeated.

Fletcher -- My first complaint is that the findings took almost ten months to come out. Secondly, almost no mention is given to what caused the extraordinary fire behavior witnessed that day. The fire whirl, or whatever it was, was powerful enough to rip healthy large junipers apart. What caused this? Did Gooselake add to the fire effects?  What safety measures need to be taken on days when fire behavior such as this is observed?  More specifically, how can this type of fire behavior be adequately predicted?  Will a high Haines give us fair warning?  Can the NWS predict these events?  Third, why did this Task Force engage with the fire when they had no communications with the incident team managing the fire?  Fourth, did the Task Force even have a solid order?  Fifth, was a designated lookout posted?  I have heard there was not. Sixth, was the briefing given by the TF Leader adequate?  I have heard it was not.  Seventh, apparently there was poor to no conversation with air attack.  Eighth, why was SCOFMP leadership not better prepared to accept this fire. Why was SCOFMP's coordination so sloppy with the team managing the fire?

Lower Mahogany -- From an outside perspective, it would seem that poor tactics were employed on this burn.  A several mile long front is, at face value, very hard to control over several days with hot dry weather in the forecast.  Should smaller units have been tackled?  There is wide spread second hand information that the leader of the fire melted down for an hour or two at least.  What can be done by us as an organization to avoid this happening in the future?  This state of mind is very common during lost prescribed fires.  This was barely touched on in the review.

Common to both -- 1) A significant amount of people on both events had bad feelings about the strategy/tactics employed.  Did the leadership ignore these warnings?  Is there a systemic failure in our organization to effective utilize feedback from mid-level and lower supervisors?  2) Both of these had reviews that were low on information, low on effective changes that can prevent future mistakes, and low on self-examination from the incident leaders as to a basic 'What went wrong.'  3) Both reviews did not display strong leadership from the SCOFMP fire staff to insure that the South Central Oregon Fire Management Partnership does not repeat these mistakes.","The point of these reviews is NOT to hang one individual for being the bad guy. The point is to build a high reliability organization that can effectively, and resiliently, incorporate lessons from mistakes into daily practice so that these mistakes are not repeated. The wildland fire management playing field is inherently uneven. Weather, terrain, fire effects, and human unreliability consistently have the potential to have catastrophic results. We are going to face similar issues in the future. There will be other mistakes, hopefully not involving fatalities. We must have significant improvement in creating timely, fact driven, and accurate reports on what went wrong and what steps can be taken to mitigate future events occurring. Sometimes all that can be done is sharing the basic knowledge/facts of what occurred. In this, SCOFMP fell flat in the past year.

The most basic corrective action that must be taken is to have Fire Staff provide stronger leadership in these incident reviews and insure that there is a quick dispersal of information to the fire community on what happened. Simply put, build a High Reliability Organization that has proven successful in many military and civilian high risk environments.    Researchers have found that successful organizations in high-risk industries continually reinvent themselves. For example, when an incident command team realizes what they thought was a garage fire has now changed into a hazardous material incident, they completely restructure their response organization. HRO teams are comfortable and adept at quickly building creative responses to failure. Failure happens, and HRO teams lean on their training, experience and imagination as a reliable means to recover from failure. [Citation needed]

I have cut and pasted some information off of the internet regarding the building of a High Reliability Organization.

'There are 5 characteristics of High Reliability Organizations that have been identified [2] as responsible for the 'mindfulness' that keeps them working well when facing unexpected situations.

Preoccupation with failure

Reluctance to simplify interpretations

Sensitivity to operations

Commitment to resilience

Deference to expertise' (Wikipedia)

'In 1984, Perrow investigated 'normal accidents.' He concluded that while all organizations would eventually have accidents because of their complexity and interdependence, some organizations were remarkably adept at avoiding them. The question that Roberts sought to answer in her stream of research is why do some organizations not have as many failures as others? From this question grew the definition and characteristics of HROs. At this point in its development, the research has identified some key characteristics of HROs. These include organizational factors (i.e., rewards and systems that recognize costs of failures and benefits of reliability), managerial factors (i.e., communicate the big picture), and adaptive factors (i.e., become a learning organization) (Grabrowski & Roberts, 2000). More specifically, HROs actively seek to know what they don't know, design systems to make available all knowledge that relates to a problem to everyone in the organization, learn in a quick and efficient manner, aggressively avoid organizational hubris, train organizational staff to recognize and respond to system abnormalities, empower staff to act, and design redundant systems to catch problems early (Roberts and Bea, 2001). In other words, an HRO expects its organization and its sub-systems will fail and works very hard to avoid failure while preparing for the inevitable so that they can minimize the impact of failure.'

This is a safety issue. It bears on the safety and effectiveness of our primary firefighters and our capability to deal with the fire and all-risk environment, and that being of ever-increasing complexity. Days and days are spent trying to take an increasing amount of 'required' training. Many months are spent on trying to get hiring accomplished, to the point that we are in initial attack and still do not have hiring resolved, even though the process was initiated last fall. Background investigations that will not be finalized until long after the employee has gone back to school, only to be repeatd again the next year, put our ability to staff an engine at risk. Increasing levels of required training to meet security and HR objectives put our ability to accomplish drills, fire training, and preparedness at risk. Firefighter medicals have been problematic at best, with paperwork that is not sent directly to the prospective employee, paperwork that languished on a desk for weeks, and hiring personnel who are not familiar with the process - these are situations that should be shouting 'Watch Out'! The administrative training and medical processing are all important items, but they are absolutely not more important than a firefighting resource that is trained and prepared to do the job.

The smokejumper spotter was getting conflicting information over the radio about what sort of action he should have the load of smokejumpers take. He had understood that Alaska Fire Service policy regarding wildland fires that involved burning hazmat had been changed during the winter to state that wildland firefighters would not be deployed to such situations until a properly qualified hazmat specialist evaluated the incident to determine where it would be safe for the firefighters to work (AFS has long defined dumps as hazmat sites).

One dispatcher told him that it was up to the IC to figure out what was appropriate, while the zone duty officer was trying to figure out what sort of air resources could be used on the fire without deploying people on the ground. Fortunately, locals contained the fire before the jump ship arrived and no action was taken.

Upon returning to Fairbanks, the spotter was informed that the policy regarding action taken on wildland fires that involve burning hazmat had not been changed to require a hazmat specialist to determine what areas were safe. Other spotters commented the next day that they were not clear on what the AFS policy was. The situation is further confused by conflicting versions of the AFS “Brown Book”, Operational Procedures, Policies, and Guidelines, depending on the source of the Brown Book. The link on the AFS web site to the “Brown Book” states one policy under paragraph Y. Refuse Dumps and Hazmat Site Fires while the printed version for 2008 has a different policy.","AFS firefighters need a policy that clearly defines the roles of the various players in wildland fire response when hazmat is involved. This policy must strictly follow BLM policies and OSHA regulations in regards to hazmat and hazmat releases. The policy must describe how AFS will operate within these requirements, recognizing that AFS wildland firefighters have only Awareness Level training in hazmat response.

Either introduce hands on training back into refresher training, or revamp 80 hour refresher making a national stanard with clairification of what is mandatory and absolute before returning to the fire line for another year.

The ROSS and IQCS system among other electronic based systems has really put a damper on hands on experiance and training.

During firing operations the Red Dragon PSD exhibited a power failure. Following proper procedure, the aircraft landed. After the burn boss and operator went through the machine and the power system, the pilot reset the fuse and it was determined that a power surge in the motor tripped the fuse. We determined that the power surge may have come from switching speeds on the operator’s tether.

After returning to service, operational flight was continued. During the course of this flight another power failure was exhibited. With this power failure, an ignition of two balls in the slider block occurred. Following corrective action, it was determined that we need to land and check the power system and perform a visual on the slider blocks. After removing the hopper and the slider block cover, a small leak in the water extinguishing jet was notice. No water had been used. Once the power system check and the visual on the slider block passed inspection, the machine was activated to test power continuity. The machine “fault” light on the operators tether was on. The fault was low water. No water was used in either in-flight procedure. Water reservoir was then topped off, and the PSD energized. During the power up testing it was noticed that the shear pin between the drive motor and the slider blocks was sheared. Operations were stopped and the aircraft returned to base.

Upon further inspection it was determined that a small chain of events led to the shear pin for the drive motor to fail.

1.	The Red Dragon has a fault built into the machine that eliminates the slider block gates from opening if water level is inadequate. It also closes the slider block gates in operation should the water level show signs of being low.

2.	Engaging this fault in flight will caused injected spheres to become lodged in the slider blocks.

3.	Engaging this fault during operations at full speed will over RPM the drive motor and cause the shear pin between the drive motors and the slider blocks to fail.

During the course of operations, the helicopter made a tight turn to accommodate the firing pattern. This turn activate the low water fault. The initial power shut down resulted in the drive motor over revving and the shear pin starting to fail. Injected balls were still able to clear the slider block. When the second fault shut down occurred the drive shear pin failed. This fault caused two balls to become injected and lodged in the slider block. The gate blocks did activate to eliminate other balls from dropping.","Several pro's and con's of using this system.

1. The water fault is a unique idea. But leaking valves may cause the fault to activate with use. Filling on perfectly level ground may not occur in the field. Perfectly level flight may not occur in operations. I think the idea is sound, the implementation of the idea is not.

2. The remaining balls in the hopper adjacent to the slider blocks did not melt or ignited in the procedure. This is a good design for the machine. The rotating slider block protected the rest of the spheres.    I am a member of the Interagency Aerial Ignition Group. This machine is in here to be tested and reported on. I will follow up with this group and the company to resolve this issue.","05/12/2008 00:00"

The Type 6 Engine responding went ahead of the fire to determine proximity to an occupied residence prior to engaging in suppression. The engine then approached the advancing fire and chose to drive through an area of low flames in an attempt to get into the black and begin suppressing the fire. Instead of punching into the black the engine entered an area of unburned fuel.

The engine stalled, presumably from lack of oxygen as the unburned island was then consumed, The engine occupants remained in the engine and rode out the flame passage. The engine was able to restart after flames subsided and the engine was used to suppress the fire.

Both occupants of the engine sustained small burns on their arms and wrists. The engine sustained considerable damage in the form of blistered paint, scorched tires and melted and deformed plastic parts.

At least one engine occupant wasn't wearing a full complement of PPE. The engine attempted a frontal assault on the fire and positioned themselves ahead of the fire with unburned fuel between themselves and the fire. No safety zones except the black were identified. The escape route chosen led to an unburned island instead of to the black.","The useage of normal PPE would have prevented the minor injuries to the firefighters which occurred.

Keeping one foot in the black and an anchor and flank strategy would have obviated the burnover.    The BIA provides wildland fire training to departments that are under agreement to enhance their wildland fire suppression capabilities. Those efforts will continue. It is hoped that by sharing this near miss in this forum that others will take note of the hazards of frontal assault on fast moving grass fires.","02/20/2008 00:00"

We started noticing a very strong background noise and feedback on the transmission signal going out of the office was getting worse.

A ticket was opened to rectify this issue before fire season starts this spring. When the Radio Tech arrived he ran some tests and though the problem might be in the phone line going between the satellite radios and the base station on the water tower. We had the phone company come out and they said it wasn't the phone line.

So we still have radio contact out of the office but it is very scratchy and spotty at best, and fire season is just around the corner. Because it is not currently fire season the Radio Tech thought this would be a low priority issue.","I suggest an updated radio system.","01/29/2008 00:00"

The spray from the ignited flare struck 3 personnel, burning holes through their nomex pants. Each of the three received small 1st & 2nd-degree burns on their legs where the nomex burned through.

The manufacturer's recommended 'safety circle' for the 2-1/2' flares is 30'; the personnel were over 100' from the flare's landing zone.

Luckily, the students were paying attention and were able to get out of the way of the flare; nobody was directly struck by the flare.

Terrain was flat with no obstructions. Wind and other environmental conditions were not a factor.

All PPE (nomex pants & shirt, hardhat, safety glasses, gloves, boots), were being worn and in good condition.

All students had signed a JHA that was specific to the training location, and had been trained on how to properly throw the flare (training was not a factor).

The flares were 6 years old, but in good condition and had been stored in a dry cache in their original containers. However, the manufacturer stated they do not recommend using flares that are over 3 years old.","1) Increase safety circle to 150'

2) Under manufacturer's recommendation, do not use 2-1/2' flares that are over 3 years old.

3) Ensure personnel that are waiting to take their turn throwing flares are behind and off to one side from the throwers (not directly behind them).    1) Cadre stopped ignition of that batch (October 12, 2001) of FireQuick 2-1/2' flares.

2) Increased separation of personnel waiting to take their turn throwing the flares to 150', and were moved to a location that was not directly behind the throwers.","01/17/2008 00:00"

The IC was positioning rural fire department engines and then proceeding to the west side of the fire to begin line construction and burn out operations. As he proceeded west, a type 6 engine was observed along the west flank of the fire. The IC was unaware of the engine having arrived at the fire and had not requested an additional type 6 engine.

Upon approaching the engine the IC learned it was a BIA engine manned by personnel from the Creek Tribe. Some dialog took place as the IC attempted to determine what the engine crew was doing, and why they were there without his knowledge. The engine boss indicated that he had attempted to contact OK OFS personnel on a State Fire radio frequency. That particular frequency was not being used on the fire. Getting no response from the OK OFS personnel, the BIA engine boss had proceeded to cut a fence and began applying water along the west flank of the fire.

The issues are:

Safety –

If the IC had not noticed the BIA engine on the west side of the fire, and he had proceeded with line construction and burn out, the BIA engine could have been trapped in the fire.

The BIA engine boss put his men and equipment in harms way unnecessarily.

Communication –

The IC had no knowledge of the BIA engine’s presence on the fire.

The BIA engine boss had no knowledge of the action plan for the fire since he hadn’t checked in with the IC.

Public Relations –

The BIA engine crew cut fences when gates were available to use. If they had checked in with the IC they would have had knowledge of the action plan and that would not have been necessary.","If BIA had contacted OK OFS dispatch office they could have told them the radio frequencies in use on the fire or contacted the IC for them and relayed to the IC that they were on the scene.    The IC explained to the BIA engine boss that he should have made a greater effort to contact him before beginning initial attack operations on his own.","01/15/2008 00:00"

Fuels - they consisted of Salt Ceader roughly a 10 yr rough and inpetrable toolies along the river, hot when burning, once black easier to move though.

Terrain- it’s best to describe the river rough sometimes, steep rock then inside that a sand riverbank. Very few entry/exit points on to the river.

River Conditions - the river water level changes due to dam control and weather changes. River water level changes up or down a foot or more in 24 hrs. The sand bar location was hard to find when over cast dark night. Fire crews have little or no knowledge of river area due to river patrols. Down snags and brush in the main channel make navigation with deep draft boats a challenge. Erosion of banks cause steep walls making it hard to access the fires in places. The following are the issues:

Refused to use available resources to relieve inadequate resources on the fire.

The following were available resources:

Rural Metro wildland fire teams.

Helicopter

Fire behavior was extreme with running and spotting with limited visibility at times down to inches. Fuels were one-hour flashy fuels (grass-shrub). Terrain was rolling hills with wooded draws, slopes of 0-25 degrees, multiple washouts present. Concern is volunteer fire department personnel riding in back of fire units on rolling attack It was discussed with the volunteer fire department at safety training, when their Fire protection Agreement was renegotiated and on a previous fire that it would no longer be acceptable practice for them to ride in the back of moving vehicles on rolling attack. It was expressed to me that it was their department’s decision that this was the way that they were going to fight fire when it was discussed on the previous fire. When they were found to be riding in the back of the units on this incident, I notified the IC that he needed to get them out of the back of the units and onto the ground and if they refused that they should be released from the incident. As the two units had split up, the IC went to one unit and I went to the other. I notified the engine boss that the two individuals riding in back would have to get on the ground and fight fire from the ground, as it was a safety concern that we had addressed earlier. I was informed by the engine boss that his fire chief had told him that they could fight fire any way they wanted. I then informed him that if his personnel did not get on the ground that I would ask them to leave. He told me that they were not going to get on the ground. I then asked them to leave. The IC had a similar conversation with similar results. I was approached by three units from the same VFD later on the incident and asked if I was releasing them from the incident. I again informed them that if they would not fight fire from the ground then I was releasing them. The same engine boss I had talked to then informed the other units that they were leaving and they left the incident.","I think that it is going to take someone above my position to convince this VFD that riding in the back of units is not a safe method of rolling attack and will not be acceptable on fires that they operate on under the Fire Protection Agreement we have with them.  I think that unfortunately, the Fire Protection Agreement between this VFD and the BIA needs to be cancelled until they come into compliance with this safety concern unless an agreement could be reached prior to cancellation. It doesn't appear that they are willing to work with me, so I believe this will have to be done on a regional or national level.","10/16/2000 00:00"

Situational Awareness - None of us 3 crew members were aware that duals on the 52 tend to loosen. The BIA has no excuse for this shabby training!

Other Human Factors - Poor training given by BIA training personnel - area perso","Weather : 2mph wind, partly cloudy

Road Conditions : Highway 16 - in Hells Canyon area, narrow (with narrow shoulders) winding two-lane road with hairpin curves. Posted speed limit 20-25 mph in some places in Hells Canyon.

Terrain - Hilly

Fuels - Ponderosa Pine with grass understory 7 of the 8 lug bolts had sheered off by the time we heard the 'flapping' noise. After tow truck operator lifted up the rear end, he grabbed ahold of the remaining lug bolt & pulled it out & the 2 duals fell to the gravel road! He said to me, 'God was on your side today.' If the lug bolts had sheered off just minutes earlier while I was navigating the hairpin curves, the 52 would probably have rolled over on its side & possibly a complete roll, doing bodily injury to the crew. We departed the base camp 24 miles W of Custer, SD at approx 6:50 AM. I was driving the Model 52 fire engine which was fully loaded with water. Also in the cab were my engine boss and a third crew member. I drove through the steep and winding area of Hell's Canyon. I continued west to the junction of highway 16 and 117. 117 is a medium width gravel road. After driving 1-2 miles up 117, I heard a 'flapping' noise and brought the Model 52 to a stop along the edge of 117. Our inspection of the right rear duals revealed that seven of our 8 lug nuts & bolts were gone.

Safety Issue - If the lug bolts would have sheered off while I was driving on curving highway 16, the Model 52 could possible have rolled onto it's side. In certain places in Hells Canyon we might have completely rolled the 52, doing bodily harm to one or all three crew members. (I had my seat belt fastened)","Primarily, better, more thorough training regarding the Model 52. The Fire Manager for the Midwestern Region (Aberdeen, SD) needs to make sure 52 crews are aware of the tendency of lug bolts to loosen. My FMO needs to learn more about the Model 52. Also my FMO needs to go on at least one incident per year with us.  Make sure that regular torquing of the lug nuts is part of all engine operator training.","09/05/2000 00:00"

However to say that either the FMO (the supervisor of the IC) or the IC themselves should provide 'corrective action' is ludicrous. Also in this case here, the party's involved should at the very least had some discussion as to what happened, and why. I was assigned to the Richfield district for some time after this incident, and not once was I approached about it by either the FMO or the IC.

My comments are in parenthesis after the 'corrective action' comments.

IC:

.......I told them to hike north along the East Ridge to help hold the north edge of the fire. Ops and the FMO flying the fire the afternoon of day 2 observed the fire making short but intense runs from below the cliffs. They also saw the fire making runs on the south-facing slope to the north ridge. Ops and the FMO both felt like it was safe to move crews 2 and 3 along the East.....

(A 'short but intense' run is just as dangerous as a large one. The fact is that they spent a very limited time deciding whether these runs were a threat.)

...........that most of the hike along the East Ridge was in the black and that the short intense runs from below were not a threat to the two crews relocating. It is ironic that the SMJers felt it was unsafe to walk crews 2 and 3 across the East Ridge and yet one of them did exactly that.

(Once again..... 'most' of the hike. There were places along their route that I considered to be very threatening. In fact were they finally stopped, presumably to take a break, was directly above where one of these 'short but intense' runs happened. It was not, in fact, a 'short run'. It was an extreme run up a chute. Very long flame lengths and gas balls ascending several hundred feet were witnessed. It is not ironic at all that a smokejumper walked the same route. This particular smokejumper has many years of experience in observing fire behavior, and the operative 'one smokejumper' is important. One should know that it is much more difficult to maintain control of 40 people as opposed to yourself. The smokejumper in charge (JIC) was taking into account the experience levels of type II crews in making these decisions. I agree with him. And the fact that they stopped where they did, proves this as far as I'm concerned.)

Air attack and the SMJers were making tactical decisions on the fire without consultation with the IC. Air attack did not follow the appropriate chain of command when making these tactical decisions.

(Air attack and the smokejumpers were making tactical decisions, because there was no direction from the IC. Air attack made several 'suggestions' to the IC during the IA phase the first afternoon. A crucial one, I believe, was the suggestion to forgo bucket drops from a type III helicopter at that elevation, current fire behavior and with prohibitive turn around times for water, and get firefighters to the fire. Or at the very least get aboard the ship and make a recon of the fire. Give up the 'rank'. Remember, the IC never set foot on the fire. The tactical decisions needed to be made. At times these decisions are crucial, and I am sorry but if I can't make commo with the IC, I will make these decisions.)

The FMO, IC and ops review does not agree that the IC and Ops disregarded safety concerns.

(Of course they don't agree. The decision to camp the crews in the meadow, shows either the disregard for safety, the disregard for the opinion of the only people that have 'seen' the fire, or the ignorance for the plan to burn out the entire bowl, which you will remember was where the meadow was.)

1) The IC was never able to give a good briefing to the SMJers on tactics, fuels and fire behavior. All other crews were briefed face to face..........

(Answer.....Get on a helicopter and go meet face to face with the firefighters on the line.)

2) Air attack and the SMJers seemed to be unfamiliar with local fuels and fire behavior.

(Unfamiliar? Who was concerned for the welfare of the firefighters? Who recognized that a crew was in a position of threat by one of these 'small but intense' runs? Who recognized that the fire was spotting 1/4 to ½ mile distances? All of the smokejumpers on the ground and myself have a great deal of experience in great basin fuel types and weather conditions.)

3) SMJers were more willing to take input from air attack than the IC, there seemed to be a greater trust between air attack and the SMJers than with the IC.

(The smokejumpers needed to trust someone. Once again the IC never made it to the fire line, plain and simple. Air attack is there for a reason. Save for airspace safety, his or her number one job is to help the firefighters on the ground accomplish their job. To provide intelligence on size and behavior of the fire, and to provide them with 'eyes' to look for safety and tactical concerns. It also is the job for air attack to provide this intelligence to the IC as well, which I was doing.)

...................................................................................................................................................

I realize that there was a lack of resources available at that time. Believe me. However, it is times such as these when people tend to get tunnel vision; trying to do more with less. The fact that the IC was over burdened with other tasks, i.e. logistics, et al, I'm sure plays a very important part of this. The incident commander should not be having to deal with these (non operational) items at the complexity level, as was the case here. Nor should the IC be heads down cutting line. A medium can be reached. In this case, the JIC is himself a type III IC, as is at least one other jumper. There was no reason that these individuals could not be trusted to make 'good' and 'sound' tactical decisions, which in my opinion they did. Myself and the ATGS trainee are also Type III IC's. So there was plenty of experience out there that day making good and safe decisions.

It was a busy time around Richfield, and that makes a point for utilizing some of this expertise out there. I worked with this IC later and I felt the IC did a fine job. While I do believe that there were mistakes made in this particular case, I also believe that some of these were compounded by other factors. One in particular was the priority setting at the GACC level. Had we had better air support (airtankers and helicopters), I think truly that much of the issues here would never have become.","","09/05/2000 00:00"

Two personnel one being the FMO, were acting as STL and

I.C. on this fire. They requested my crew to stretch out along the dozerline at the top of

the fire and hold the line. Due to lack of resources the crew was spread out pretty thin

along this line, and was spread out an unsafe distance. Visibility was very low due to the

thick smoke.

We were experiencing 35 mph winds with falling snags and frequent spotting across the

fireline. The designated safety zone was not safe due to large amounts of unburned fuel

on the surface as well as unburned canopy. We could not see the main fire and at the

time we were not in communication with anyone who could. We had no air support or

other visual platform. There was an escape route with a hot spot 30 ft in diameter

centered on it. I was informed that it was safe as the spot had a hand line around it.

When we {myself and crew) arrived at this spot we discovered it still very hot. I felt the

need to post personnel with tools and radio at this spot {due to the high winds) before

joining district personnel above it.

McNeely Fire 8-14-00

Prior to leaving, I spoke with the incident commander for

the McNeely Fire concerning pumps, hose, and appliances we would

need for the suppression effort. He advised me that he already had it taken care of and

that it was already in the back of his truck.

Upon arrival at the 25 acre McNeely fire {a 1.5 hour drive), I noticed that the fire was

up slope from a large clearcut area that was also up slope from us. I estimated that the top

of the clearcut was about 1,000 ft away, with the smoke from the fire visible 2-3 hundred

feet beyond that. The I.C. asked my crew to begin plumbing the fire and locate the pump

at our current position on the road. The water supply was to be provided via porta-tank

and tender .

My crew began to retrieve the pump and equipment and found a Mark III pump, gas,

pump kit, 6 lengths of 1.5' hose, and one twin tip nozzle. Upon questioning the I.C.

about the shortage, I became aware that he had no idea of the type and amount of

equipment needed to plumb this fire, but expected us to do it anyway with what he had

brought.

Later, when on the fireline, I observed an excavator working the fireline on about a 75%

slope. The fire was backing down this slope, and making uphill runs {towards us- we

were on the hilltop) from burning laterally on the slope as well as from spot fires caused by rolling material. There were many unburned fuels on this slope between the fire and

us. The excavator working this area could no longer work effectively due to the

steepness of the slope and had a difficult time getting back up to the top of the hill.

Because of the excavator problems, the I.C. instructed my crew to begin downhill line

construction from the hilltop. I informed the I.C. that this was an unsafe working

situation due to unburned fuels between us and the fire below, the steepness of the slope,

an inadequate anchor point, inadequate escape routes, and no safety zone. Ultimately, I

refused to do what he asked, but suggested some alternatives, which he was not receptive

to. He then requested (over the radio) the district office to send him an excavator with a

winch so that it could lower itself down to the fire and winch itself back out at the end of

shift.

Several days later a person from the mountain Lookout (overlooking this area) discussed

the slope/canyon area with me and agreed that it was too dangerous to put a crew into.

During a fly over from air attack, the I.C. told air attack of his intentions to have crews

build line into this area. Air attack advised the I.C. not to send personnel down into the

canyon.

During the morning briefing of 8-18, comments were made in which I and the crew were

made to feel as if our concerns for safety were not important, and that we were

troublemakers. It was stated by the district staff that they wanted to put a crew to work

where we were supposed to work (and refused), but that they wanted a crew 'who was

not afraid to dig line'. This was said in front of everyone as part of the briefing. I not

only felt unappreciated, but also felt unsafe for myself and for the crew.

When the Type II - Team arrived, I voiced my concerns with them.

These were accepted well, and we were treated with appreciation for the work we had

performed. We received a good evaluation from this team.

We arrived on scene approximately 2030 and worked through the night to successfully line and mop-up the fire.

The night was cool with temps ranging from 40-45 degrees. Approximately 0630 on 08/11 it began to rain (at least a good hour-long soaking rain). Several people were already wet from the night-long use of hoses and water for mop-up. After inspection by the District our crew was released. We went to our bus - very cold and wet - to be transported back to camp.

Upon arrival at camp at approximately 0900, overhead was in transition and all camp resources were in the process of packing and moving. While the overhead team knew where we were and knew our status, they did not make consideration for us to obtain clean, dry nomex, gloves, or have access to any supplies and hot showers. When I went to supply they said things were being packed and they WOULD NOT GIVE US ANYTHING!! Likewise, if it were not for a few quick thinking crew members who RAN to the shower unit and asked the shower manager to 'please let us shower', the showers would NOT have been inaccessible as well.

When fatigued from work, the effects of being wet, cold and hungry are compounded. We were denied access to dry clothing (which was in a truck) and if it were not for a few crewmembers, we would not have been able to take warm showers either. We did have breakfast, but clearly, the most immediate need was to be warm and dry. We did not have access to supplies for three days after that until the new overhead became set-up. My headlamp broke that night also, so I was without until the new supply unit came.

There was an obvious disregard for the basic well being of our crew. Our crew was mostly Forest Service and Park Service professionals and technicians. I find it hard to believe that basic human needs and basic safety concerns were ignored. I was extremely disappointed that this Type I overhead would treat a group of peers (Type II FSR Crew) in this manner - not to mention any human being. We felt quite degraded, unappreciated, and that overhead concerns were more important than a 'lowly' hand crew (of peer professionals!)

On 8-4, I re-contacted ground support, vehicles were still not available. I then contacted CDF management on site, I can't remember his name he was the liaison officer. He said he would look into the situation. A vehicle was provided the next day.

The story is not over. The vehicle provided was a jeep Cherokee. When I picked it up I was not told or warned that it was a 2x4 vehicle and not a 4x4. I didn't even know there was such a thing. This was not a problem until 8-6 when I was told to drive to the division break between Q and E just above the Aqua Tibia Ranch. It was a four-wheel drive road. I drove part of the way up the road before I realized that the vehicle was not equipped with four-wheel drive.

Cargo can be a very tiring job, especially if you are busy sending out supplies all day for a week on end. These are the types of inefficiencies that wear crews out physically, bring morale down, take choppers away from other tasks, such as water bucket drops, and most importantly, increase crews exposure to choppers unnecessarily.

Fire Behavior: Fire had burned actively all night and had exhibited crowning and torching all day, depending on the winds.

Fuels: Ground litter, Sage, Pinion Juniper, and Ponderosa Pine.

Terrain: Steep, rocky and inaccessible terrain with terrible road conditions and poor footing. Road was overgrown with trees (canopies connected), with no safety zones or room to turn around with an engine. Access and egress were a max 10 mph. Poor Communication with Burnout Operations The plan was to secure the eastern corner of the fire and then to work on containing the other flanks. Several times I heard 'We have to secure this side.' Our engine and 3 other Type VI engines were working with a Type II crew. We were about 1/3 of the way down the hill, and were mopping and cold trailing to secure the line off the 'two track' road. We had anchored off the top of the hill and tied in with the black by doing a burnout earlier in the day. It was slow going, but it was working.

I had heard from command an hour earlier that a hotshot crew had arrived, and had asked them to begin digging line from the bottom of the hill and tie in with us. The next thing I know, they're burning out below us. If we had not learned of the burnout so soon, we could have been in trouble. The area we were in had poor escape routes and safety zones.

We called Command on the radio and asked if there was indeed a burnout operation going on below us. Command didn't know, and couldn't contact anyone who did. Eventually, the Shot Supervisor came to talk with us. He could see we were not pleased and were about to pull out, but asked us to begin burning out from the top of the hill and tie in with them in the middle. I refused, the other engines agreed, and we all pulled out. There were just no safe areas for an engine, much less four, to support a burnout operation.

We were asked several more times to support the burnout, and all engines refused. We had all had experience on this fire with burning out and the fire activity. We told the supervisors we would consider supporting the operation later that evening if the line was properly prepared (preferably with a dozer line and several safety zones).

We spoke with the IC later; he wasn't aware the shot crew hadn't informed us they were burning.","This problem can easily be prevented with:

A. Better communications!

B. Complete recon of the line and proper prep work by Shot Supervisor and the crew before beginning ANY burnout operation.  If anyone had bothered to ask us, we would have told them that it was not safe to burn in that area at that time. I know that engine crews are not as experienced at burnout operations as shot crews, but we do know what our engines are capable of, and we knew what that fire was capable of. There is no reason that we should not have been part of making the decision to burn. There is also no reason the line was not reconed and all forces were not consulted before lighting.

In the future, I urge crews to talk to the local resources; they know the fire behavior, the terrain, and important safety issues.","08/08/2000 00:00"

On July 25th 2000 at the Happy Helibase, a helicopter was damaged by a water tender during dust abatement. The incident occurred during the lunch break of the pilot. The tender was attempting to back around the helicopter when the main (yellow) rotor was struck. The rotor was stressed in the center while it was bent in the downward direction. Myself and the Pilot were notified immediately and visual damaged was noted.

The vendor's mechanic and the agency inspector were notified from the Happy ICP. During my contacts with appropriate personnel I discussed the pay issues. I was directed to place the ship in non-pay status/unavailability if it is not a reasonable fix. Once the ship was repaired the pilot would be paid for ferry time/service miles back.

I do question this process since the pilot was not at fault for the incident nor was the vendor at fault. The water tenders were requested by the deck coordinator to mitigate the dust issues. Therefore, I proposed to the appropriate personnel to pay the availability rate. Second, Type III helicopters are not required to have a mechanic on site. (Which it is stated in the interagency contract that all helicopters shall have a qualified mechanic on site. C-28). Third, the agency inspector requested for a certified mechanic to report to the fire, inspect the ship and complete the maintenance log without the additional personnel fee for $300.00 per day. There seems to be still a gray area on what constitutes as an official request. Immediately the water tender was staged for clarification on the incident.

FIRE BEHAVIOR - very high to extreme behavior, 100% probability for spots. Torching, crowning, short and long range spotting.

FUELS - North aspect was white fir. South, east, west aspects were gambel oak, sage and mountain mohagony.

TERRAIN - The main canyon runs east to west with a bowl at the top end. Over the east and north ridge is a very steep cliff with multiple steep canyons. Main concern is for the life and safety of those working under people that don't know what they are doing and putting lives in extreme danger. I can see future fatalitites if these type of people continue to manage fires. We ( 8 smokejumpers) arrived on the fire about 1700. The first order from the IC was for us to work the east side in the very steep cliff canyon. We are not superhumans and did not bring our repelling gear for that kind of work. We had major fire activity on the north aspect which threatened ourselves and our gear so our first action was to move everything to a safe location. Next, we helped 2 helitack personnel with a helispot on the north ridge ( H-3 ). We then hiked down the main canyon well below the fire to prepare for backfire/burnout operations. A type II crew was sent by the IC to work above the fire and down the south ridge bringing drip torch mix for us. Not once did we get to meet with IC and get the main objectives, IAP, or incident command structure. The IC stayed in base camp and not once stepped on the fireline. Communication with the IC was very limited. We had to relay messages through either the helicopter pilot or air attack. Without knowing any of her plans, the IC asked who was the IC for the evening.

7-23-00

The morning started by going to the meadow in the canyon and begin firing operations. The jumper-in-charge got a hold of the IC and requested the IC go on a recon flight. The IC did not. IC rarely went on recon flights. During firing operations, the IC said they were sending 2 crews to H-2 - which was on the east ridge above the bowl we were burning. The jumper-in-charge told the IC not to send anybody to H-2 or H-3 - all the jumpers agreed it was an unsafe location and time for crews to be there. Not long after beginning firing operations, the column bent and started spots on the adjacent north slope (south aspect). Numorous spots took off up the north side slope. About 1300, when the majority of the bowl was burning, 2 crews were flown to H-2. None of us knew of this until later. The crews were instructed to construct line downhill with fire below in the east aspect cliffs. The jumper-in-charge specifically said not to send anyone to H-2. Out of nowhere, without knowledge of the IC's doings, a crew boss was trying to reach the jumper-in-charge on the radio. All the jumpers were shocked that crews were sent to H-2 despite the order not to have anyone up there. The crews were sent to H-2 with minimal water and food. The jumper-in-charge told them to stay where they were and in a safe zone. About 1700, a recon flight was in progress with someone we never heard of. It turns out this person was in Operations. The Operations person told the crews at H-2 to hike to H-3 - which was through the green with fire below and fire in the steep canyon over the north ridge. Jumper-in-charge told the operations person to get those crews out of there now. Air attack also said to get those crews out of there now. The person from Operations seemed too busy trying to find a good place to camp everyone. The operations person planned on having everyone camp in the meadow in the main canyon. This meadow had fire all around it and was only big enough for not even one crew. What was this person thinking? The jumper-in-charge talked to the IC and told the IC to get the crews flown off the hill. The IC seemed more concerned with getting lunches to everyone. IC also thought it was more important to use the helicopter for bucket drops. The 75-gallon bucket seemed totally worthless on a fire blowing up. The IC said the helicopter doesn't have much flight time left. The IC continued to use the helicopter for 3 more water drops before finally flying the crews off the hill.

WATCH OUT SITUATIONS BROKEN

3. Safety zones and escape routes not identified - The IC would have put crews into areas with no safety zones and escape would have been impossible.

5. Uninformed on strategy, tactics, and hazards - IC did not inform us on the plans.

6. Instructions and assignments not clear - it seemed the IC wasn't clear on the importance of keeping people off the hill while the canyon was blowing up.

7. No communication link with crew members - it was rare to have direct communication with the IC.

8. Constructing line without safe anchor point - IC would have had crews working in a steep canyon without a safe anchor point.

9. Building fireline downhill with fire below - IC wanted to put crews in this situation

11. Unburned fuel between you and the fire - a person from Operations was telling the crews to hike through the green with fire below and all around.

12. Cannot see the main fire, not in contact with someone who can - IC stayed in fire camp. not once did the IC step on the fireline.

13. On a hillside where rolling material can ignite fuel below - IC was planning on having crews work in a very steep cliff canyon where it would be easy for rolling material to ignite fuel below.

16. Getting frequent spots across the line - IC planned on having people work in areas that were spotting all around.

1645 hours: Jumped fire with seven smokejumpers, fire was burning in continuous conifers with flame lengths 100' - 150'.

Contacted the dayshift IC and asked what the plan was. IC wanted us to work the East side of the fire to prevent its spread towards the East. I informed the IC that it already had crested the ridge to the East and it dropped off into very steep rocky cliffs, and it wouldn't be possible to put people in there especially with the fire crowning and with the wind coming out of the west. I was told the fire was low on the priority list for resources, and our assignment was to burn out the North facing slope with the heavy conifers and try to hold it in the sparse fuels in the bottom.

I put one smokejumper up high on the North ridge as a lookout and sent five jumpers with two saws to the West side of the fire to tie in the two rocky ridges for a burn out. Myself and the remaining jumper started a test burn starting at the East ridge and bringing fire with us towards the West. The winds were out of the west and the fuel type in the bottom was a thin strip of grass and sagebrush that we were hoping to hold. The burnout went pretty good and we brought fire about one third of the way down the draw and stopped at a small meadow.

I was informed that (crew 1 and crew boss 1) was working their way down the West edge starting from H-1 and that they would be bringing us drip torches and fuel for the burnout. They would tie in with the jumpers cutting line on the West side.

2200 hours approximately: Dayshift IC turns fire over to the evening IC.

Jumpers continue to cut line on West side; fire is staying on North Slope.

2350 hours: Evening IC decides we don't have the personnel to carry out the rest of the burnout and tells the crew to hold up there for the evening and we will do the burnout early am.

Jumpers improve sawline and tie in with rocky ridges, bed down at 0200.

Day two

0630 hours: Contacted the dayshift IC to see if the plan was the same about burning out the bowl, IC said yes and told us to proceed when we were ready. I ask (Crew Boss 1) if we can have that drip torch fuel and torches down to us soon, Crew Boss 1 says it is on the way. Continued prepping for burn, wind seem favorable mainly out of the West.

Dayshift IC asks me about flying crews into H-3, I told IC that I didn't want any crews flown into that side of the fire (East ridge) because of the burnout operations below it and it would be unsafe.

0700 hours: Requested retardant through dayshift IC, was told this was a low priority fire and we probably wouldn't get any. Also suggested getting Type I crews because of the steep terrain and saw work, but was told there weren't any available.

0715 hours: I hiked up the North Slope and brought the drip torch and fuel back down to the jumpers.

0930 hours: Started burning with two lookouts posted, one on each side of the canyon. Burn is going well with winds gentle upslope.

1015 hours: Upper smoke column from burnout starts to lie back over line to the North.

1020 hours: Burn operations are stopped to see what winds do.

1030 hours: Start to get some spots over the line and I send three jumpers to work on them. At about this time the helicopter starts shuttling in a crew to H-3. When I found this out I contacted the pilot and said I didn't want crews on that ridge and they were flown out. The spots on the south facing slope below H-3, were in the mountain mahogany and gamble's oak were getting bigger and we weren't able to pick them all up. I called the dayshift IC and gave the IC an update. I requested the IC do a recon to take a look at the fire and so I could talk to the IC, but it didn't happen. I had the jumpers pull back to the West side and improve the sawline.

1230 hours approximately: I was contacted by another crew boss (crew boss 2) and asked were I wanted him to work. I had no idea he was on the fire or where he was. There was confusion for a while as I tried to find out where he was and I found out that he was at H-2 in a saddle directly above our burn operations on a helispot I didn't know existed. He had been flown into the East ridge where I had repeatedly said not to put crews and now the spots were getting more active below.

1245 hours: I tried to reach the dayshift IC again but no luck. I sent a smokejumper to tie in with the crew boss.

1330 hours: Fire intensity picking up, spots on South slope making small runs up to the ridge. (SMJ) ties in with (crew boss 2) and finds out there are two crews at H-2. He said he was told to work down over the East Ridge in the very steep rocky cliffs and to call me when he got there. I had told dayshift IC earlier that it was too steep and dangerous to work crews there. I asked (SMJ) if the crews could hike across the ridge top past H-3 and help hold on the ridge. He checked it out and didn't feel it was safe to hike two crews across the ridge with partially burned and unburned (mahogany and oak) below them and fire on both sides of the ridge. I told him (SMJ) that I trust his judgment and to hold the crews at H-3. The crews constructed a safety zone around H-3.

1520 hours approximately: Fire trying to crest North ridge, (SMJ2) works with helicopter doing bucket drops. I start making my way towards (SMJ2) to help out and size up. The other five jumpers and one squad from (crew 1) are finishing up widening the sawline and handline on the West side.

1600 hours approximately: Four helitacks arrive to help (SMJ2), and (SMJ) tells me it is still unsafe to hike crews across, so I relay to dayshift IC if I can move a squad across with helicopter. I am informed that the dayshift IC is going to do a recon and the helicopter will not be available to shuttle the crew across.

1630 hours approximately: I arrive at ridge top and help keep fire from going over ridge.

1645 hours: I tie in with (SMJ 2) and the Helitack members working on the ridge.

1650 hours: (SMJ) arrives at ridge top.

1700 hours: Helicopter flies over fire, I try to call dayshift IC and am informed that a person from Operations (Op) is flying the fire. This is the first we have heard of this person and didn't know there was an ops person on this fire.

1710 hours: Helicopter lands at H-2 and (Op) tells (CB 2) and his crews to hike across the East ridge to us. Air attack arrives at the fire and I ask for a recon and size up. Air attack informs me that our gear may be threatened because the fire is heating up dramatically and may hook around the East ridge.

1720 hours: (Op) asks me where I want to camp the three crews for the night. I told him I didn't want them on the East ridge in the first place and didn't feel it was safe to camp them up here. He asks if I can camp them by our gear and I told him it wasn't safe, just like air attack had just said. He then asked me if I could camp them all in the small meadow in the middle of the fire with active fire all around, which we were planning to burn out directly below it. I replied, 'are you kidding', and got no response and never heard from him again.

1725 hours approximately: I heard radio traffic indicating that (Crew Boss 2) and his crew were crossing the East Ridge. I called (Crew Boss 2) and said to look down in the canyon below before going any further. Crew Boss 2 said it was blowing up and I told him to go back to H-2. Air attack also got on the radio and told them to go back to H-2. The chimney on the East side cranks with 150' flame lengths coming up below us and right where the crews were. The crews reach H-2 and stay put. Myself, (SMJ), (SMJ 2), and the four Helitack, observe the run coming up the chimney below us and fall back to our safety zone.

1735 approximately: I call the dayshift IC and to tell her to shuttle (Crew Boss 2) and his crews to ICP now. IC is worried about helicopter time and wants to work the bucket more. I told the IC the fire has blown up and the bucket isn't doing much good, and to get the crews out. IC suggests camping the crews where they are. I tell IC again that is not a good place to camp crews and there is fire on all sides of the helispot. Air attack talks to dayshift IC and strongly suggests that the IC get the crews off the mountain now. IC says again about flight time but reluctantly agrees. Helicopter still does three more bucket drops, before starting crew shuttles.

Eventually most of the crews get flown out to ICP. Half of (Crew 1) hike out with the jumpers on the West side, while the rest of us and Helitack hike three miles out the North side with an hour ride to ICP.

Day three

Jumpers work to contain slopover on North ridge, a human repeater is set up on the South ridge, Type II team takes over at 1800.

The whole time I was on the fire I had very little common with the IC. Even on the repeater I could almost never reach the IC. The way I established commo with IC was to relay through helicopter (pilot) when he was in the air.","IC or Operations should fly the fire perodically and maybe even set foot on the fireline.

All resources should have a thourgh briefing and plan before arriving on the fireline.

A chain of command should be set up (ICS) and all resources should know who is in charge and running operations on the fireline.

Set up a repeater or make sure radio is monitored so ground forces have contact with IC.

Be willing to take advice/input from people on the fireline as to what is happening and where it is not safe to work crews.

Give clear instructions, make sure they are understood.

Fire behavior was erratic with some torching. Our crew observed small runs and areas of more complete consumption. Due to frequent spotting the fireline was very undefined, with possibly much potential. The terrain was mountainous, approximately 9000' at base of fire, rolling with moderate relief. Fuels were timber with grass understory, the grass had not cured at this time and the 1000 hour fuels and lesser dead and downed were carrying the fire, thus adding to the spotty nature of the fire. Escape routes and safety zones were inadequate for personnel and equipment to escape if needed. Footing was not bad. Road access was mountain two tracks, very narrow and rough to use as escape routes. From the very beginning it started off bad. We were given faulty directions that did not apply to us. Once we arrived in the area the frequencies we were given were not correct. After some time, and a few calls to dispatch we were able to establish communication. We arrived at the fire and the IC told us to bed down. We woke up and got a briefing and an IAP from the IC that really didn't help us much at all. Soon a Strike Team Leader came down to show us the way to the fire and gave us a better briefing of the situation at hand. From the moment we got on the fire, it was obvious that everything wasn't very organized. We felt there wasn't enough of the right kind of personnel. Soon into the day and due to the lack of logistical support and no food, the moral of the crews at hand was rapidly declining. Had it not been for the Strike Team Leader (who basically became the head person) it would have been complete chaos. The only pro we had was our Air Support who kept in good contact with the Strike Team Leader and kept him updated. We had no medical support and not even any food. We had no report of the weather. We were planning to DEMOB later that night per our home unit. We attempted to contact the IC, but the IC did not respond for a five-hour period from 1500 to 2000 hrs. Due to the breakdown of the Command Structure, the IC had left the fire, thus causing us to have to DEMOB ourselves. The first thing that I noticed was wrong was the command structure, there was no definite structure to the chain of command. We had no immediate supervisor. The second thing that I noticed that was wrong was the IAP (incident action plan) was from the previous two days before. The IAP was also not signed by the IC. The third thing wrong was the briefing given to us was unclear and not up-to-date with the current fire behavior. No fire weather was given to us and the weather in the IAP was from the day before and the day before that. The forth thing wrong was driving into the fire were the designated safety zones and escape routes. The safety zones were nothing more then deployment sites and the escape routes were death traps. The fifth thing wrong was the logistics on the fire. There were hand crews having to share MREs (meals ready to eat) with engine crews. Some personnel on the fire had not eaten anything in two days. Sack lunches were promised and nothing was ever delivered. The sixth thing wrong was the medical attention. Some personnel on the handcrews went down with serious blisters with the possibility of infection. No medical personnel were dispatched or on the scene to provide support. This caused EMTs (emergency medical technicians) to stop their work and deal with this. The seventh thing wrong was when it came time for the initial attack resources to leave the IC was no where to be found and could not be reached on the radio. We had to demob ourselves and leave the fire only telling the engine boss we were working with. This also put the full responsibility into the hands of an already overwhelmed engine boss. The eighth thing I felt was bad was the attitude of the Type II crew on the fire. They felt that asking for food, water, and sleep would give an image that they were weak and not up to par. Which was the total opposite. The crew in mention had been working for two days prior to getting dispatched to this fire, and to put them out on the line with no sleep and food is a large hazard.","The biggest thing that could have been done to prevent all these problems is a more structured command system. Overhead who would pay more attention to the needs of their resources and have pay more attention to crews needs. For the safety zones and escape routes, areas needed to be cut and possibly burned out big enough to safely accommodate twelve engines or more. The safety zones we had were nothing more than deployment sites or even worse.  There needs to be a better command structure. Maybe the forest could have some sort of pre-set structure for fires in the future. This would be more efficient and increase productivity. With this structure in place it would already eliminate many of these other span of control problems.

Also, the Incident Commander or other direct supervisor needs to be available at all times.

Briefings for incoming resources needs to include the coverage of LCES. Communications were inadequate. Escape Routes and Safety Zones were also inadequate.","07/21/2000 00:00"

Fire behavior was somewhat erratic, with torching and excessive spotting this was how the fire spread, one spot trees torch causing more spots. Fuels were a typical Model 11 timber with slash; probability of ignition on 7/19 and 7/20 was 100%. Spotting distance was 10 to 800 feet. Footing on this fire was uneven and very rocky with slash and down and dead 1000-hour fuels plus the slippery footing caused by retardant drops. Road conditions were bad, a single track 4 WD road surrounded by heavy fuel and very few turn around areas. Work rest guidelines, logistical support, ingress/egress lCES and most all this incident should have been bumped up to a Type II Incident to enable getting the correct resources on scene. This fire was not an engine operation single track access with very few turn around areas in the event of a fire blow up. Access to turn around areas would have been compromised leading to a catastrophic entrapment with 65 human lives put in serious jeopardy. As for work rest guidelines, who can make a cognizant decision after working 36 hours straight? 36 hours plus of continuous fire suppression after informing the incident commander of the problem was told twice to continue working. Communications between IC and suppression forces was marginal at best. Most resources felt less than adequately informed, or supported of the 18 Watch Out Situations only the last one was not violated due to no one was given the chance to sleep.","Incident Commanders following the lessons that they teach.

It's a sad day when the people that instruct us feel that the guidelines are for everyone but themselves practice what you preach.

Fire Behavior: Fire behavior for the previous operational period was extreme, fire was spreading at nearly 20 chains/hr. with 10 foot plus flame lengths. Fire was currently creeping after cooling down over night, but dust devils with high possibility of blowup or spotting were occurring by 10:00.

Fuels: Juniper & Sage-Grass mixture, some areas of good black, but others with high reburn potential.

Terrain: Steep, rocky, inaccessible terrain throughout most of the division, with poor footing and road conditions.

Other: Fire was uncontained and line did not exist on much of the division. This fire had been called contained by local resources and blown out a few days before, due to extreme conditions. Proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Our engine (Type VI) was assigned to the 'North Division' of the Muddy Creek Fire (T-140) on the morning of July 13, 2000. The incident was still Type 3 at this point, and there was no printed Incident Action Plan. We followed our Division Supervisor (DIVS), along with several other engines and a partial hand crew, to the northern section of the fire. Upon leaving camp, my crew and I noticed that our DIVS did not have a nomex shirt on. We expected him to put it on when we arrived on scene, but he only continued driving. Division resources were split up and spread along this section of the fire; our assignment was to assist a small (4 person) hand crew in strengthening line down a rocky, inaccessible portion of the fire. The DIVS exited his truck to give us our assignment, again neglecting to put on his nomex shirt, helmet, gloves, or a fire shelter. We assumed he at least had those items in the truck with him. By now, we were on the edge of the fire, along the top of a chute, with some actively burning juniper nearby. We were parked in good black, but it was still a potentially dangerous area.

Later in the day (about 15:00) we saw our DIVS from a distance as he checked in with the crew we were working with, still not wearing adequate protective gear.

Finally, while we were pulling off the line, he still had not put on his PPE; obviously he had failed to do so all day.","There are a few things that could have prevented this safety issue:

(A) I, or my crew members should have said something to our DIVS directly, or to the Safety Officer.

(B) The Safety Officer should be around to check with each division throughout the day.

While a number of crews were being worked, a water trailer (under equipment rental agreement) was brought in to supplement the local water supply, as it would not furnish enough water. After the symptoms displayed by the crew the water was tested and indeed showed coliform. The trailer tank was then sterilized, retested later, and was found to be ok.

The forest facilities engineer surmised that when several crews were there and using significant amounts of the water, the water was continuously being replaced. Once the crew level had been reduced to one, water was used at a much slower rate and the same water remained in the tank for a long period of time creating the problem.

The forest will no longer utilize supplemental water until the main system is maximized and sufficient water will be utilized from the supplemental system to allow for timely replenishment.","","08/06/2012 00:00"

Upon arrival at the incident (0600), the Hanford FD IC team found a 'strike team leader' among the contract crew personnel and assigned all 10 engines to him. (Span of control shall not exceed 7). None of the FS personnel on the three engines was STL qualified. Wanting to help, we went out with that 'STL' thinking things would be clearer when we reached our division. Not so. Upon returning to our home unit after this fiasco, we had a debriefing, and it turned out that each individual engine was a single resource, and we should not have grouped up like we did. This was not really understood.

The second issue is communications on this incident. The problems with that began with the 'STL' not giving us any kind of briefing. We followed him out of the staging area thinking we would have a line briefing when we reached our division. We did not, and became separated from that 'STL' due to the fact that our FS engines were 2-wheel drive, and had low clearance for going off road, which we did, again following the 'STL.' The three FS engines turned around and headed back to the paved road, thinking to find another way to our assigned location (which we had figured out through hearsay). We were not reunited with the 'STL' until much later in the day, after the afternoon blowup had occurred. We had almost no face-to-face communication with the 'STL.' Radio communication was also terrible, many other people complained about it later on the incident. When we first arrived, and received a shift plan, the frequencies had changed, and we only realized this because of an overheard conversation. We cloned our radios and tested them in the staging area, but communication was extremely sketchy once we reached the division. This continued for the rest of the fire. The only frequency that was consistent was our home project frequency, which we were forced to use illegally.

The third issue is contractors and their qualifications. As mentioned previously, we were skeptical of the 'STL' currency and general fitness for the job. Other members of the contract engines were also obviously not able to pass the WCFT pack test at the arduous level. Their equipment was constantly breaking, one slip-on tank leaked constantly, and none of us felt comfortable relying on these people in a potentially serious wildland fire situation.

The fourth issue is chain of command. On that first day, we had no idea (especially once we were separated from the contract engines) whom the individual was making the decisions on our division. We did not know who the day shift IC was since the IAP was vague and seemingly inaccurate. We did not know positively (due to the radio problems) when the team transition was taking place. Later on in the day, after we had returned to the ICP to regroup) we received some direction from Ops on the Type II team. Then when our firing operation crossed to the Hanford reservation, we lost contact with Ops, and another individual in a Hanford FD vehicle was giving us some direction. We do not even recall this person's name.

As you can see, there were some very serious problems for us with this dispatch, and we were balancing safety with usefulness. I do not think that the problems listed here are very uncommon, even in today's fire world, and we hope that bringing this to your attention will help prevent further incidents like this from occurring. Of course, our own experience with this as individuals will help to remind us that no matter what do not MOVE on the fire line until all elements of LCES are in place. I used the brief description portion for that, so I will be brief here.

We had a concern that at least four major fireline safety factors were breached on this incident; span of control, communications, contractors and their quals, and chain of command.","One thing that would have prevented part of the problems would be to be dispatched with a qualified strike team leader for every five engines, or at least have the O number of one to rendezvous with on site.

Another is to have stricter and more frequent inspection of the contract engines and the personnel that are actually dispatched with them.

Having a Communications person actually at the ICP when we arrived also might have mitigated the radio problems.

Our attitudes about trying to be helpful, and do the job we were ordered to do (i.e. stop the spread of the fire) must change.

Also getting more experience going out as a strike team would also help us all feel more comfortable with our roles.  We will make a commitment to get all aspects of LCES clear, including assignments and identity of supervisors before leaving the staging area.","07/16/2000 00:00"

I have been fighting wildfire for approximately 16 years and have participated in quite a few clusters, but this Chinese fire drill ranks right up around the top. I am not trying to make light of the seriousness of this event. Specifically, there was a breakdown in command and control; nobody knew who was in charge. Crews received no briefings on their assignments. The basic firefighting orders and watch out situations were violated many times. LCES were non-existent. There was a glaring lack of coordination between various agencies resources. No maps of the areas were issued. It seemed as if the IC was too heavily involved in trying to be directly hands in involved on suppression instead of coordination of resources and managing the suppression activities. The problems with communications were that everybody was trying to speak at the same time on whatever frequency they could. No dedicated frequencies were announced. Crews from different agencies were sent out to the line without having the proper frequencies in their radios then left to fend for themselves when it came to finding and programming those frequencies.","I believe that it would be very helpful for Yakama Agency BIA Overhead personnel to get a lot more large wildland fire experience or to hold resource coordination drills.","06/28/2000 00:00"

That net is used for flight following, fire ground command, and fire administration concurrently. This hazard has been previously identified in 1999. This situation creates a variety of potential safety problems related to communications during incidents (wildland fire, and all risk). Primary among them is safe, effective flight following. On June 18, 2000, at about 1230 hours, Grand Canyon wildland fire resources were dispatched to a reported wildland fire just outside the park on Kaibab National Forest lands. Park resources dispatched included one (1) helicopter, two (2) engines, one (1) handcrew, and miscellaneous overhead. Forest resources were also dispatched but did not contribute to the communications problems on the park command net. Once on scene, tactical resources used a common tactical frequency. This call was unfounded, no smoke was found.

During the initial dispatch, the command net was used to dispatch all park resources and flight follow the IA helicopter,. It was also being used to flight follow an on-going fixed wing recon for the park at the same time. With fire ground command and flight following on the same channel, communications for flight following were compromised several times. This is an example of a situation that occurs frequently at Grand Canyon. The park helicopter flies an average of 80 missions per month for fire, Search and Rescue (SAR), medical, law enforcement, and maintenance. The wildland fire channel is also used regularly for SAR and medical ground command. Flight following is compromised regularly during these incidents as well.","Dedication of funding to install equipment that would facilitate the use of the new flight following frequencies in a timely manner would assist in providing more safe and effective flight following for all fleet, contract, and Call-When-Needed (CWN) aircraft used at Grand Canyon.  1. Make effective use of tactical frequencies.

2. Make all personnel aware of conflicting uses on command frequencies.

3. Encourage expenditure of funds to install needed equipment.","06/20/2000 00:00"

This study took the form of an exercise where firefighters were asked to estimate minimal safety zone size, while viewing a fuel type slide and given basic fuel moisture and fire weather conditions. After making this estimate, the students were then shown a slide of the fuel type while actively burning, and students were given the opportunity to adjust the initial estimates. A total of 11 different fuel types were evaluated in this manner.

The results of this study were dramatic, and reflect an inconsistency that has the potential to compromise safety and decision making.

Effective safety zone size plays an important role in our decision-making processes throughout the life of a fire. During the Planning Meeting, the ICS-215 and ICS-215a must reflect the discussions of safety and fireline assignments by recognizing the critical elements to monitor that trigger firefighter movement away from danger, or into safety zones.

TERRAIN: Flat gravel access road across levee adjacent to reservoir.

FOOTING: Generally good except for minor puddles and minor loose surface rock. Typical of a minimal to moderately maintained gravel forest road.

OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL: Test course was laid out in 1/3 mile legs with start at opposite end of finish. This pack test setup is a nice one in opinion of injured party. It appears effective and efficient to administer. Site often has light breeze in morning which is beneficial to participants.

EQUIPMENT: Participants used their pack of choice--most were typical fireline day packs. Most packs were weighted with gravel, sand or a combination of other objects (weights, water, etc.)

Injured participant was using a major manufacturer one piece 'Hotline' pack with padded shoulder straps and a minimally padded, typical waist band found on one piece fireline packs. It was weighted with gravel filled bags with most of the weight being central and low in the pack. It was the same pack the participant had been practicing with for nine weeks. Footwear was stiff style hiking boots with ankle support. Methodology of work capacity test creates increased potential for back injury that could be reduced

with certain preventative measures

Pack test training videos could better address spinal posture as related to safely performing pack test.

Pack test training videos could be improved by suggesting types of packs or pack configurations

that allow participants to maintain a 'neutral' or 'proper lifting' spinal position while

participating in test. Approximately midway through the pack test, individual experienced peculiar and moderately painful cramping action in region of upper to mid-hamstring on left leg. Individual made decision to stop if this pain did not dissipate soon--at first it did not seem to be a clear reason to stop immediately. Individual massaged area of pain with left hand and adjusted body posture to a crouching posture transferring weight to thighs and straightening back hoping to relax cramping. This caused pain to dissipate, as if origin of pain was actually a cramp.

Individual completed pack test successfully and was able to do so at personal pace used in training. 'Cramping' pain was experienced several times during test but would disappear with adjustment of walking stride and straightening of upper body position, so individual felt that they could continue and would be sure to do good post test stretching. In past testing on Forest, other participants had suggested moving to crouching walk periodically to relieve pressure of pack on back. After test, participant dropped pack and cooled down while walking on an adjacent trail. It began to rain heavily so participants loaded up in rig and left finish point.

Pre-test stretching was done on individual basis prior to leaving station for test site and during the period while packs were being weighed on site. Plenty of fluids were consumed prior to test. Injured individual preferred to warm up by walking up and down adjacent test site access road briefly, however, this was cut short due to impending start of test. Individual had stretched legs and lower back prior to test. However, during the remaining day of the pack test, individual experienced a painful left buttock, hamstring, calf, heel and outer foot. Individual thought perhaps he had pulled a hamstring, although had never done this any time prior. Sitting was very painful in certain positions. The day after test individual iced leg at home and went to work for last 1/2 of day. Sitting at computer terminal and walking was painful. By second day after test individual was in pain to the degree they felt they should stay home and ice leg--movement was difficult but improved as day passed and 'loosening up' occurred. By the third day after the test individual became increasingly worse ending up with extreme pain in left leg, lack of mobility, cold sweats, nausea and a numb foot. Individual was transported to hospital via Forest Service vehicle where lower back injury was diagnosed by emergency room doctor. Individual ultimately was found to have seriously herniated L-5/S-1 disk as verified by MRI scan and was referred to neurosurgeon who performed back surgery to repair damage on June 5. After having physiology of injury explained, individual learned why they initially felt they had a pulled hamstring and pulled lower leg muscles. As it turns out, the back injury pain of this type is often completely experienced in the leg.

Injured individual had been practicing full pack test distance for nine weeks an average of three times per week at or under passing pace and in no pain. Individual was an experienced fitness runner, a veteran field technician used to carrying a field pack and other gear. Individual has been qualified for arduous duty their entire career and made a point of being in shape for arduous duty on the fireline or in daily duties as a forest technician. Individual had also completed commercial stress treadmill testing prior to pack test and was found to have level of fitness suitable for cardio vascular arduous activities.

RESULTING SAFETY/HEALTH ISSUES:

Emphasis on back safety is an important consideration in completing current work capacity test.

Stopping when experiencing pain during pack test is important, however, it should be understood that this decision can be quite subjective, depending upon the individual, their past experience in physical training and other circumstances.

Adequate warm up and cool down time for pack test participants is important.","1) Focus on the pack test as an event for emphasis of proper lifting, or maintaining the spine in the 'neutral position' while walking. It is speculated that it is easy to forget about proper lifting posture if there is nothing in your hands.

2) While completing the pack test, utilize packs or vests that allow one to maintain the neutral or 'upright' spine position while at a brisk walking pace. This places more safely distributed weight on the spinal column. Proper lifting is enabled. Leaning forward to compensate for a heavy and ergonomically poor pack while at a fast, sometimes-rough pace potentially places extreme pressure on spinal discs that cushion and protect our backs. Although we often carry 45 pounds or more for some duration in the general arduous duty ranks, it probably tends to be the exception when we carry them at the pack test pace for the pack test distance in an ergonomically unsuitable pack.

3) Reconsider placing work capacity testing within the arena of the professional medical community. This testing is popular in other industries, can be administered by medical professionals and can thoroughly measure cardio and muscular/skeletal fitness for wildland firefighting duties. Although cost is involved, it may be able to be sought in volume at a much improved price as many Forest Service installations and other organizations have found in wellness testing activities. Professional fitness testing may also transcend body sizes--the pack test appears much more difficult to do for smaller framed, shorter folks than for medium or larger framed, tall folks. However, body size was not an issue for the injured participant.

4) When administering the test, provide an on site, announced warm up period that is separate from the pack 'weigh in' time. An idea is to allow 15 to 20 minutes and be sure all candidates in the test have this time made available, as a minimum. Allow time to walk around with the loaded pack for a few minutes to further loosen up. In the pack test it is suggested to begin at a brisker pace earlier in the test, however, in most physical activities we are advised to begin slowly and increase vigor gradually. The need for the brisk start is understood--however, that need may underscore the need for time to warm up pre-test with the pack on.

5) Consider the pack test potential for seriously injuring fit, yet aging firefighters that have had wear and tear on their bodies for years. Back injuries of this sort may be very unpredictable, however, it can be understood from medical professionals that the older we get, the more prone we become to this type of injury.

6) It has been learned that the Department of Defense provides alternate arduous cardio vascular oriented tests for personnel prone to injury in a pack type tests. Consider this in wildland firefighting work capacity testing.

7) Allow employees to get, on their own, a medical release for incident work with certain base parameters for each fitness level and make this an annual requirement as a condition of work. This release would be in lieu of pack test. Those that do not pass can improve until they do or have the option of being assigned duties suitable for their actual level of fitness.","06/20/2000 00:00"

This incident was a prescribed fire that escaped designated control lines. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) was conducting a prescribed fire to remove kochia weeds and salt cedar in the old Lake McMillian lake bed. I was working on an engine that was conducting a running attack along the flank of a flame front that had climbed the gyp bluff and was running across a loamy flat. We had just about finished knocking down the flames, using the live reel, when I observed several individuals who were using shovels to halt another small flame front. These individuals had no PPE (nomex, hard hats, shelters, etc.), but were conducting a 'direct attack'. I believe these people were BOR personnel who had been conducting the firing operation for the prescribed fire, then assisted in suppression operations once control lines were lost. No PPE in use, no shelters, etc. A potential for burn injuries if fire behavior increased or firefighters were trapped.

This is a heads up that other agencies/individuals conduct prescribed fire operations on Federally managed lands without use of PPE.","Use of proper PPE by all individuals on the fireline.

Person was only 3-5 minutes away from finishing test. Person said it wasn't painful enough to stop and pack test monitor didn't notice anything wrong, so person finished the test.

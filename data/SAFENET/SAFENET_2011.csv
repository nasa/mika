On 12/3/2011 we had our annual refresher that should have been held prior to our redcards expiring in October. We had very little notice for the refresher, many individuals were never notified. This year’s refresher was far from last year’s refresher. The last years refresher was very informative and hands on we did field exercises, deployed shelters, Arduous pack test, urinalysis, red book training, sand table exercises, etc..

This year all we did was our Arduous pack test and watch a short video on IS-700. I have been working for the Horton BIA for 5 years now I have had my squad boss and IC type 5 task book for 2 years now all I have to do is get out on an Incident and so that I could have it signed off and be working on my single resource task book (engine boss task book). It is my due diligence not to let my personal go out on a fire untrained and unprepared. Some of my crew have not been out on a fire in 2 years, did not do a refresher last year and this year received an insufficient refresher. I have had FFT2 talk to me about this refresher and feel it was inadequate. I do not want to put anyone’s safety or lives in jeopardy by letting this take place. I also do not want my reputation or qualifications affected by knowingly and willingly letting personal that have not been properly trained out on an incident and then something happening. Thus the reason I am stepping up and asking for assistance in this matter. One other concerning incident certain individuals have been told by superior personal to let individuals that failed their urinalysis to continue to work, thus also putting safety, lives, and careers on the line. I want firefighting to be part of my career, but I do not want these incidents jeopardizing my future.","I am writing this report for my corrective action.

We DID NOT do deployment exercises, map, radio, engine basics, weather prediction, etc.. I am not pleased with the amount of training we received; I feel it was lacking. I personally have not been on a fire since I first certified November 2011. On that note, I was informed that re-certification is necessary before my red card expires. A refresher course was not Made available before that time. Some of the fft2s I trained with were not able to even make this years refresher do to short notice of its availability.

We were told not to stand under some snags that were made apparent by the IC before he went to scout flank A. It was ~1:00 AM and wind speeds were in excess of 50mph and forecasted to reach 100+mph. Immidiatly the group of volunteers I was attached to started moping up hot spots right under the forementioned snags. I am young and was about halfway through my first season at that point. I knew we had to move but I was not assertive enough to get the volunteers to move from the area. We worked there for about 10 minutes when the IC told us he felt the other flank, (Alpha) was safer and told us switch flanks and work counter clockwise around the fire. Less than 1 minute after moving to the other flank we heard a large snag fall right where we were standing. Upon returning to the scene in the morning I checked where the snag was laying and I am fairly confident someone would have been hurt if the call had not come over the radio to switch flanks.","There was no immidiate action taken, the event has been on my mind because I know I should have been more assertive to get people to a safer location and that things may have been a lot worse if that call had not come through.","03/16/2012 00:00"

They left the district office and drove to the pile burn location to check the existing piles that had been burned on Monday and Tuesday. At the end of the day Employee 1 said he wanted to walk the Legacy Road which he did by himself. Once he returned everyone loaded up to go home around 1500. Once they were leaving he told the three passengers that he had difficulty hiking up the hill and had to stop several times because his chest was hurting. Employee 2 asked him additional questions and Employee 1 said it felt like someone was squeezing his heart and his hands were tingling and kind of numb. Employee 1 stated that he had to take several breaks, when he stopped hiking the pain would decrease but come right back when he would continue hiking. After Employee 2 started asking questions Employee 3 started asking additional questions since he is an EMT.  Employee 1 told 3 that it was his left arm that felt a tingling and numbing sensation. Employee 3 said he might have angina and told 1 he should see a Physician. 3 also told 1 he needed to seek medical care. 1 said he would be fine and just needed to drink some water. He said he would make an appointment to see a Doctor on one of his days off. The four folks got back to Weaverville around 1730 and before anyone could ask Employee 1 any additional questions he left and went home.

The situation is that an individual had symptoms of unstable angina or a heart attack on a prescribed burn. Nothing was done in regards to seeking medical attention for the individual. He was allowed to go home with no further question or care. On the following day 11/10/2011 Employee 1 ended up in Trinity Hospital in Weaverville which resulted in him being transported to Shasta Regional Medical Care in Redding due to having a heart attack and had to have a Stent put in.","I was not at incident at the time the event took place. I spoke with three employees who were working with Employee 1 in regards to the incident to get additional information and seek what actually happened. I also explained to them that Employee 1 should have been taken to the hospital on the spot or activated the medical evacuation plan and met an ambulance on their way out of the project site due to length of time it takes to get from the project site to a medical center.

CNF E27 went responding and was given the frequency Orange County was running the call on since search and rescue incidents are primarily the responsibility of the county. About 20 minutes later, the division chief for that area who was monitoring Orange County's radio traffic advised dispatch that the search and rescue was now a fatality on the forest. A CNF battalion chief, patrol unit, and law enforcement officer were added to the call once it was a confirmed fatality.

The safety concern was that dispatch had no radio communication with any of the resources that were at scene on any of the forest's three frequencies (Forest Net, Admin Net, or LE Net). The BC had to drive to an area where he had cell coverage and would call in updates on the situation. The patrol unit stayed on the incident until approximately 8:00 PM, and the engine, BC, and LEO stayed on until nearly 11:00 PM to assist the coroner with extracting the body since it was in a remote forest location.

The area is a known 'radio hole' on the forest. I fear that one day there will be a fire in that area (or another area where radio communication is spotty or completely absent), an accident involving a forest employee, or an incident that involves a recreation or prevention resource making a public contact that 'goes south' and the resources will not be able to communicate with dispatch and get the medical attention or assistance they need because of the lack of radio coverage there.

Other known radio dead spots on that district include Trabuco Creek Road from private land all the way to the end several miles into the forest, and Holy Jim Trailhead. There are also a couple of dead spots along Live Oak Canyon Road between O'Neill Park heading north towards Cook's Corner.","Fortunately this incident was not a fire or other potentially life-threatening emergency situation, but it did highlight the inability to establish communications with resources in this area. The BC was able to communicate with dispatch, but only when he went to a location where he had cell coverage. I brought this issue up to the center manager the next day, and reported the issue to the USFS's Customer Help Desk the following week. I forwarded the Help Desk's documentation of the issue to the center manager, who brought it to the attention of the Forest FMO.

Regional folks were sent down here to perform UTM (?) work. No notification to dispatch that they would be working on the T1 lines. Two times this week they brought the system down with no communication w/ dispatch. At the time we had precribing burning occuring and today initial attack on reported human caused fire. Local radio folks were not informed they (regional IT folks )would disrupt radio communication.

The only reason local radio people were aware there was a network problem that effected radio was by chance while working on another radio issue regional office called because he noticed there was a problem and directed local radio guys to 'clear programming' just pushed to T1 lines.

Local radio techs were able to restore radio.

This concerns me because of fire fighter safety. I was trying to reach firefighters in the field not knowing the regional folks caused a problem that resulted in network and radio loss. Network maintenance that needs to happen must be communicated with dispatch when active fire suppression and prescribed lighting is ongoing.

Both myself and local radio techs feel there is lack of concern or even the common courtesy of letting us know what they are planning on doing so we can be prepared for maintenance work.","I was called by local radio tech to walk me through how to access backup system.

I called the Phoenix dispatch to get the actual location of the Incident comand post for the Tanner fire. The dispatcher informed me that the icident location was in Young AZ,at the Reynolds Creek campground and that I would be able to find the camp in Young AZ.

We were able to leave Grants NM at 6:30 pm. The drive time to Young AZ was calculated to be four and a half hours from our location.

While en route to the incident we traveled from I-40 to Holbrook AZ, from Holbrook to hwy 377 to hwy 277 to Heber AZ. From Heber we traveled south to find hwy 288 to Young AZ. We traveled and searched to hwy 288 and did not find a junction sign or any other directional signs to lead us to Young. We traveld about 5 miles past where the junction was located until we found a road construction worker that gave us the corect location of the the hwy 288 junction.

Once on 288 we began traveling south toward Young. The road turned from pavement to gravel cousing us to slow our progress to Young.

We arrived in the town limits of Young around 1200PM, beleiving that the ICP was located in Young we thought we would be able to rest at this time and not violate the work rest ratio.

We drove through Young and several miles past before we noticed a warning sign indicating the closure of Reynolds creek camp ground. I decided to continue driving until we found the capm ground. The road turned from Pavement to gravel again causing our progress to slow. Approximately an hour later we arrived at the Reynolds creek campground and bedded down for the night.

I awoke the next day at 5:30 am and began gathering information from other firefighters on the fire operations.

An in-brief was scheduled 9-11-11 at 1200hrs in Santa Maria California. A 4390 Radio Starter Kit was on the preorder and was ordered for the incident. That was also confirmed by the CDO in Boise and was told that we were assigned a C-2 and L-2 when contacted by phone. The State Communications Technician went to expanded dispatch in Santa Maria to see if it had arrived and was told that it was coming out of South Ops.

Approximately 1800hrs a phone call was placed to South Ops to check the status of the 4390. I was told that they would check on it and call back. No call was returned and a follow-up call was made to South Ops asking again about the 4390. I was told by someone there that he had located the 4390 and it was at the North Fork Fire Station in North Fork California. I was given a contact name and number in which I called and received no answer. I contacted ground support to schedule transportation at 0600hrs on 9-12-11. On the morning of 9-12-11 I was able to contact North Fork FIRE Station confirming our 4390 was there. A Communications Tech from North Fork was able to meet the driver in Tulare to transfer the 4390. At approximately 1500hrs our 4390 arrived at the ICP.

Although not having this radio equipment readily available, we were allowed to stay on the Los Padres Service Net and provide communication between the crews on the fire and LP Dispatchers. Fire traffic was minimal and had little impact on LP Dispatch. Had this Complex been more active it could have had a negative impact on fire suppression efforts and operational safety.","See above","09/13/2011 00:00"

Operations and the 4 Division Supervisors listened to the plan and felt that the plan was a good plan for the day. Operations and divisions on the team agreed to not interfere with the operation plan and to start to transition slowly and gain situational awareness that day. The burn out had already started south of birch creek when I arrived at Doug Bar. The resources were conducting the burn out off Summit Ridge down the ridge south of Birch Creek. This was a grass fuel model so the crews were carrying their safety zones with them. The burn was going well. Winds were favorable and they were getting good depth on the burn. When I got to a position to see the operation I tied in with the TFLD that was running the burn out /holding operation. The TFLD was working with Air Attack and laying retardant with seats to reinforce the control line the crew was burning off.

The resources that had started the burn handed off the torch to another crew to complete the burn. The TFLD and I (Division) were below the firing watching and being a lookout for the crews. We noticed that there was a backing fire backing into Birch Creek on the ridge across from our burnout. At about that time there was a wind switch. The Firing had to slow due to unfavorable winds.

At that time the TFLD and I were swarmed by bees. We left our packs and ran up the ridge toward the burnout which was roughly 3-500 yards up the ridge from us. We stopped when there were no more bees. We looked over the ridge at the backing fire in Birch Creek and noticed it had crossed the creek and was on the same side of the creek as out burn out. We directed the crew to get into their safety zone and we were moving toward our packs down the ridge.

The fire was hung up on an old road and was starting to vector up Birch Creek as we were moving down the ridge. The fire was then influenced by the wind and started to make an uphill run toward the TFLD and I. The fire crested the ridge and started moving toward us. We knew our egress was cut off so we ran through the flames to hard black. There were no injuries to any firefighters. The fuels were grass so there was no residual heat past the flaming front. The wind was blowing hard enough that there fresh air behind the flaming front.

After this occurred we hiked through the black back to our packs and made sure it was safe for the crew to hike down to us. It was safe so the crew hiked through the black to our location. We waited to come down to the drop point until the firing was completed around Doug Bar. We then hiked through the black.

Lessons Learned

1.	When unfamiliar with country and fuel types operate on the side of cautious until you have a good understanding of the local weather and how it affects fire behavior.

a.	With the wind and slope alignment the fire moved faster than I expected in the grass fuel model. Looking back at the incident I should have modified the tactics when the fire started to advance into Birch Creek. The firing operations were held up because of unfavorable winds. There was not enough time to complete the firing and holding operation to the end point.

2.	As Division Supervisor I ensure the resources assigned to the division are in a safe place and then deal with myself. I was not in a good spot when the fire decided to make a run. The crews on the division were all safe.

a.	Ensure that my safety is not compromised. Ensure all resources including Division Supervisors have LCES in place.","Talked to Operations about the incident. IC made sure that LCES and fast moving fire spread was a topic of discussion for the safet officers during breifing.","09/13/2011 00:00"

While watering the road coming back towards DP30 I STOPPED five other fully loaded tenders who came across the bridge on their way to assignments on the B200 and B251 roads and discussed weight limits with them.

One Tender Operator informed me that they had been going across fully loaded for the past three days. The answer from all five was that since they were directed to cross the bridge, they thought it was safe. The second comment was that they were not very much heavier than the load limit.

A standard starter system was ordered to support the incident. The plan was to deploy the C3 repeater system and move the incident off the LP Service Net to the NIFC system for extended attack, and off of the LP Service Net.

Upon arrival of equipment, tech personnel began to open and test equipment prior to deployment which is standard procedure. It was brought to the attention of the COML, that radios received were not the standard BK portable radios that have been used to support incidents for many fire seasons. This information was also relayed to the incident safety officer. Further notifications included the CDO in NIFC that relayed radios other than the standard BK portable radios will be deployed during the 2011 and future fire seasons. They include the Motorola's, RACALS, and Datron's.

As a result of these changes several impacts/safety concerns were brought up and documented for reporting including;

1.) No Safety message/warning/bulletin/alert's were distributed to Incident Commanders, line personnel, or training sections for disemination and training prior to the 2011 Fire Season.

2.) No training materials were distributed to other agencies, government agencies other then what was contained in the 2011 users guide and what was included in the kit radio's.

3.) Software was not included with the new equipment and only state tech's had possession but had not become familar with it or the radio's yet. All communications personnel on scene with over fifty combined years of experience had never been made aware of this new equipment.

4.) Line firefighters indicated they have never worked with these radio's and felt uncomfortable going to the line with equipment they have never been trained on or had the ability to work with in the off season.

5.) The Datron and Racal radio's are digital P25 radio's that are operating on a Analog system however, still have to go through a digital processor. This has been proven to cause a delay in transmissions which again identifies a safety issue during emergency conditions.","After meeting and discussing with the Incident Commander, Incident Safety Officer, and Logistic Section Chief the decision was made to not deploy these portable radio's. It should be noted by not having the ability to obtain the standard radio's from NIFC even after requesting them, this emergency incident could have not been properly supported if the incident had continued to grow. Additionally, this also impacted the local forest's secondary freqency as the incident had to remain on their service net for incident command communications.","09/06/2011 00:00"

Crews working on the western flank of the fire were advancing line through broken terrain to the southwest. Due to the nature of the broken terrain it became necessary for crews to construct downhill line through coulee bottoms. Before line construction began a saftey briefing was conducted with all participating resources and division supervisor. It was determined that black should be brought with the hand crew to ensure rapid access to a safety zone in the event of blowup along the fireline. To aid in supressing fire along the area of downhill line construction a hoseline was advanced to the coulee bottom and supported by an engine crew. At approximately 1230 shifting winds caused a flare up to occour in a pocket of heavy fuel near the line supported by the hoselay. Fearing impingement of fire on the hoseline if the fire were to cross the handline engine crew members began to pull the hose up the hill away from the flareup. The uphill movement of the hose caused a gated wye on the end of the hoseline to open and begin to spray water uncontrolled. This was immediately noticed by one of the engine crew members who advanced to the end of the hose to stop the spray. The engine crew member grasped the wye to close the open valve. Upon doing this the crewmember's hand was burned. Unaffected crewmembers later determined the wye had became heated due to transfer of heat from the fire edge to the wye.","Per Established unit SOP's and agency 'red- book' standards individual was immediately evaluated by line EMT.

During this time period Incident Leadership personnel were involved in active incident management and planning. The type 3 team were demobing aircraft crews engines, etc., also planning for logistical support of the assigned and released resources.

The Forest type 2 crew program leadership independently initiated this action with no communication with the incident or district. Incident leadership staff were under the impression that the resources being transitioned off the fire were needed back at the local district. This was not the case it was purely an Independent Action to assign resources to the fire.

The transition of the crew leadership occured during midshift a major watchout for safety issues.

The relief resources were sent to the incident with orders to transition with the assigned personnel.

This was a major distraction to the leadership and management of the Cane Brake Fire. I was under the impression that the district wanted the local resources back also very busy with incident management.

Upon contact with dispatch and the district I found that this was an independent action not coordinated by anyone assigned to the fire.

Independent actions have been a common occurence while managing fires on this district and forest self dispatching and assigning themselves leaving fires at will are all issues that have been discussed with management as recent as 8-26-2011.

In addition to the violations of Incident Management process this was a very disrespectful act upon the Crewboss and trainee as well as a loss of experience for the trainee.

This action is unacceptable accountability needs to be addressed for this behavior/action.

While working on the Dry Creek Fire located in the vicinty of Bogus Basin Ski Hill, Boise, ID on August 17, 2011 as an 'AD' ENOP/Paramedic for the Boise District BLM, I heard radio traffic that involved a potential 'sick person'. Knowing I was the only Paramedic on our fire, I inquired to DIVS and OPS if they would like to me assess the patient.

Due to that fact our fire was only about 2-3 acres in size, getting around was fairly easy. Weather was noted to be clear skies, highs in the 80- to low 90's, west facing aspect, RHs in the teens.

At the time of the incident, the fire was in a mop-up type situation.

An individual from a Idaho Department of Lands crew was a recent add-on late season hire who was brought on from Chicago, IL area. He had only been in Idaho roughly 4 days and appeared to be not in the best of physical shape for the typical high elevation firefighting that occurs within the Boise National Forest.

While assessing the patient/firefighter, it became clear to me that the individual was experiancing a heat related emergency and possibly Rhabdomyolysis. Additional treatment and care were provided as well as transportation to a vehicle more equipped to handle the roads until we could meet local EMS.

Follow-up from the Idaho Dept of Land Fire Coordinator provided me information that he had recieved from the hospital with an end diagnosis of Rhabdomyolysis with heat exhaustion and dehydration.","After hearing the radio traffic of a potential sick person, I immediately inquired to the DIVS and OPS if they would like me to check on that person. They did and it only took me about two-three minutes to walk to his location downslope.

I introduced myself, provided my medical qualifications, and asked if I could begin an assessment of the firefighter. It was noted he still had on his radio bra, helmet, pack, and yellow. I asked for help from his crew in removing the above noted items.

I immediately inquired as to his fluid intake and output during the last 24 hours, his previous locations, and activities since coming to Idaho.

I also began to have him drink slow sips of watered down Gatorade as well as took a bottle of water and began to cover his upper torso area with it in an attempt to begin the cooling process. From that moment as well, I also notified OPS of the problem and he began to coordinate an ambulance to our area as it would be at least a 30-40 minute time frame before their arrival.

After beginning some of the cooling and re-hydration process, we began to attempt to walk him downslope to an awaiting vehicle that had the A/C running. As we attempted to do this, he began to dry heave again as well had an increase in muscle spasming. Then he began to complain of shortness of breath and an inability to move any further.

With these sudden changes, I noted it would take to long to accomplish getting him down the mountain and therefore elected to do a conveyor belt to get him moved to the vehicle.

This was accomplished with a twenty man crew, the firefighter's crew, and myself. Upon arriving at the vehicle, we placed the firefighter in A/C, placed cold water bottles around his neck and armpit area and had him continue the fluid intake.

We met the local ambulance at the county line and transfered care to them.","10/14/2011 00:00"

Communications were effective between ground resources and air attack. At 1100 a type 6 engine (2003 Ford F550)started to have problems with power. At 1230 the engine moved forward into the next retardant drop to continue securing the line. At 1240 the motor was running but could not produce enough power to move the engine forward or backwards. All instrumentation gauges indicated all components were within normal operating range.

The fire spotted across the line behind the engine and made a run at the disabled engine. A second type 6 engine tried to pull the disable engine into the black, but was unsucessful due to lack of traction. The two engine crews were able to burn around the disabled engine utilizing a a hose lay from the engine working in the black. Once the burn out was complete, both crews got into the black. A helicopter was borrowed from the neighboring Dinner Fire and was used to cool the area around the disabled engine. Air attack was overhead the entire time this event was occuring.

On 8/7/2011 I was assigned to the Point Fire as Air Attack. The point fire had been using another Forest Service repeater (Magic Mtn. ) but it was not serving them as a command net and Air Attack was needed to relay fire information. I tried to check Knoll mountain with no luck and asked dispatch to do the same. Still no luck

From the air and from dispatch the result was the same it did not work ,my suspicions were confirmed.

I contacted our local ratio technician as a courtesy to in form him. I also made one more attempt from two ground locations.

On 8/8/11 I submitted a trouble ticket for fire related. Issues. The attached is the dialog from this ticket is below(attachment 1)

Essentially the USFS - ISO is unresponsive, indifferent and thinks they can get to the Knoll mountain top repeater in September. We have had three recent fires were it’s use would have greatly aided fire fighter communication and safety. In my communication with the ISO, I have indicated my displeasure at there down grade of the situation and lack of response. I further indicated thet we would have to disengage from a fire with out communications and if any life safety issues occurred the ISO should be held accountable.

It is my belief that this repeater has been down for much longer and was probably not visited for service this year. I have tremendous empathy for the field personnel of the ISO and their work load. I have limited patience with lack of responsiveness and indifference to critical communications issues. As a Fire Manager, I am held accountable for my actions I rarely see any accountability at the ISO. Further I do not get any timely communication about schedules or actions.

(Four wildland fires and one medical aid). On May 30, 2011, I was sent via e-mail a spreadsheet identifying changes to CALFire communications (Radios, Frequencies, Tones, and Naming Convention of the Channels). I forwarded this information to the communications technicians and my dispatcher that was preparing our 2011 communication plan. Because our radios are not capable of supporting these changes, our lead radio tech elected to leave the naming conventions the same on our com plan until some of the kinks could be worked out. There are two issues that occurred yesterday:

1. While responding to the Tuttle Incident, we gave our engines CDF Tac 8 as their ground contact. When they arrived on scene, they could not talk to anyone on the incident on Tac 8, because CalFire has tone protected their frequency on Transmit for Tac 8 with Tone 16, 192.8. This information was not included in our com plan (or on our dispatch), because some of the USFS radios are not capable of supporting tone 16 (only 14 channels). Someone on the fire told our engine personnel to put their radion on tone 16, when they did this, it worked fine. This is one of the radios that supports this new change to CALFires Tac Frequencies - luckily.

2. Meanwhile, we sent an engine to a fatal medical aid to assist TCU. When they arrived on scene, they were trying to raise the CALFire resources on the air, to find out where they were needed. When the CALFire engine didn't anwser them, the San Andreas (TCU) dispatch center advised our engine to come up on the 'VFIRE 22' frequency. This is the old White 2 frequency, but our engine personnel did not know this, because it wasn't updated in the radios or com plan, as our technicians were trying to iron every issue out before making such big changes.","First, I forwarded an e-mail explaining the situation to all of the module leaders and chief officers on the Stanislaus NF.

The second engine company's engine boss told the BLM engine boss that this was not needed and it should not be done.

This action placed not only our crew, and the engine company, but his own crew in jeopardy.

This was not the first time during the evening that this engine boss had wanted to burn. During the entire hose line installation, he talked about wanting to burn the drainage that we were in. This was stopped by the Division on multiple occassions. The major concern with the burn that he wanted to complete was that there was no start and no end to the burn location. We did not have any control lines, we only had a progressive hose line that was moving slowly.

On August 4, 2011 a chase truck went on patrol to the Gentry mountain area via the Star Point mountain road on the Manti La-Sal N.F. We proceeded up the road via the Wattis Mine road, to the Star Point mountain road where we were caught in a rain storm, and our chase truck was struck by lightning.

Place of Accident

39 Deg 31’ 16.36” by 111 Deg 02’ 13.73” at elevation of 9117 feet

Activity before accident.

On 8/05/2011 at 13:43  a type 6 enhanced light engine and a Ford Super chase truckwere going on patrol to look for any lightning caused fires due to the lightning activity in the area. Lightning activity for the prior day (Aug 3rd) showed a great deal of lightning in the area we were going to patrol. A week prior to this date we had a fire in the area that we were going out to patrol. It was also started due to lightning. The weather at the time of departure was partially cloudy with less that 40% cloud coverage, dry with temperature in the 80’s, and humidity in the 40’s. We drove from Price to the Hiawatha turn off and proceeded to drive up the Wattis Mine road. From there we continued on the Star Point mountain road and drove up the mountain to an elevation of approximately 9000 feet in, at which time a storm cloud moved over our location and began pouring rain and pea- sized hail onto our vehicles. I decided to stop the vehicles due to slick road conditions that could cause an accident and try to wait out the storm. We tried to pull to the side of the road and started sliding so I decided to stop where we were to avoid sliding off the road. At that point, we decided to wait together in the engine while the storm moved over our location. We also advised the Moab Fire center of our actions. The time was 15:10.

What happened?

While waiting out the storm we took refuge in the fire engine so we would all be together. The chase truck was parked 10 feet in front of the engine. We were talking about the severity of the storm and the weather in the area and started hearing buzzing on the radio. I turned the engine’s radio off and left the engine running while we waited. The chase truck was still running and the radio was still on with lightning in the area (I told the crew to leave it running and we can turn it off after the storm passes). At approximately 15:17 the chase truck was struck by lightning on the radio’s antenna, which appeared to be “vaporized”. I was looking out the driver's side window and observed a lightning bolt hit the hillside approximately 50 yards to the south of our location. We were able to find the strike point latter that night to confirm where it hit. After the bolt of lightning hit the Ford, we remained in the engine and I noticed, all of a sudden, that several indicator lights had turned on (check engine light, air bag light, ABS light, etc.). We turned off the fire engine and alerted MIFC what had happened by cell phone. I also advised them that we were ok and there were no injuries to myself or my crew members. I told the crew to stay in the truck and not to touch any metal while the storm passed over our location. Approximately 30 to 40 minutes later, the storm had finally passed and I went to check on the chase truck and observed it was inoperable and was not possible to put into neutral. There was also a very distinct smell of ozone emanating from the chase truck with undertones of burnt plastic. The lights and FM radio were still operable but the mobile radio and ignition seemed to be fried and inoperable. I contacted the duty officer and advised him of what had happened, advising him that we were okay and did not need any medical attention. While we were waiting, there appeared to be more storm clouds moving over our location so we disconnected the batteries on both vehicles and again waited the storms out in the Engine, communicating via cell phone when necessary. We attempted to  get off the mountain, but due to the road conditions and storm activity we aborted this tactic and decided we would spend the night on the mountain and have someone get us the next day.Help left Price and tied in with us around 9:00 the next day. I contacted a tow company from Price, UT and advised them that we needed two wreckers to come and retrieve our vehicle and what was wrong with them. We agreed that it would be best if they came the next day (Aug 5th) to get the vehicles. They left on the 5th at 8:00 am to drive to our location. Due to how the vehicles were positioned on the mountain and the road conditions to our location I advised them to come from the Morland road then drive across the Gentry Mountain road to Star Point and tie in with us where we were disabled. They drove up to our location via this route and we met them at Star Point where they could only bring one tow truck in to that point.  We drove them down to where the vehicles were located and they informed us at that point that they could only get one tow truck down there at a time due to the road conditions and trees that were overhanging the road. We told them we could remove the obstructions in order to get the vehicles out, and they said that would be great. They advised us that they wouldn’t be able to pull the fire truck out due to the weight and if it. They thought it would be better to drive it down Star Point road to the pavement where they would be able to tow it. The Engine was operational at reduced power and was able to be driven down the Star Point road via Wattis Mine road to be parked at the Cold Springs Shooting Range turn off about 6-9 miles from the accident site. I drove the vehicle down to the turn off and arranged a ride back to Price. I asked them to call me to meet them when they were ready to tow the vehicle out. The crew proceeded to work with the tow company to get the disabled Ford off the mountain and remove any obstructions that would prevent them from getting the truck off the mountain. At approximately 15:00 our supervisor called me and had me drive out to meet the tow company at the engine. The driver for the tow company, met me at the engine and hooked up to the engine to tow it back to town. He attached the engine to his wrecker and I asked him if he was going to remove the rear driveline so it wouldn’t cause any problems with the automatic transmission. He said “we don’t need to remove the driveline if the engine is still running. We can put it in neutral and have it idle back to town,” and “by doing that the tranny still pumps fluid through the system and we won’t have any problems.” I advised him that we typically remove the driveline on all vehicles we have towed and he said “that’s a waste of time, it would take me 45 minutes to remove the driveline when we don’t need to.’ I told him “you’re the expert that’s why we called you so we wouldn’t have any problems with the vehicle. Your also taking responsibility if something does happen to the tranny.” He assured me that nothing would happen to the vehicle and started the Engine and placed it in neutral. He loaded the truck and drove off down the road. I followed him down the road until we came to mile marker 8 where the Engine's undercarriage began emitting smoke. I started flashing my lights and honking my horn to try to get his attention to stop. He stopped shortly after mile marker 8 when he noticed the smoke coming from the engine. He said after he stopped that he had not had this problem before and that they would be responsible for any damage that may have occurred due to not removing the driveline. We looked under the engine and noticed a red liquid that appeared to be transmission fluid leaking from the transmission, and I saw smoke billowing out from where it was leaking fluid. There was also the appearance of spatter marks from leaking fluid located throughout the under carriage of the engine. The driver said “I guess I should have taken the driveline off.’ He then retrieved his tools and proceeded to remove the driveline from the Engine.Heremoved the driveline and towed the vehicle to the Chevrolet dealership where I previously scheduled to have them take a look at it without further incident. After arrival I requested one of the service technicians to come look at the engine before it was released from the tow vehicle and to write me a report of what he observed and heard. The service tech came out to look at the vehicle and advised me he would write up a report of his findings on the invoice after he found out what the problem was. The tech looked under the Engine and observed the leaking transmission and fluid that was present. He also touched his hand on the transmission and said “oh yeah it’s fried.” He told me that it wa overheated and looked like it had blown a seal. He said “the driveline should have been removed and that wouldn’t have happened.” He then started the engine while it was still hooked up to the tow truck and placed it in reverse, which did not work. He then placed it in drive, where it gave the impression of forward movement. The tow company replaced the driveline on the engine and removed the engine from the towing apparatus. Todd then tried the engine in reverse, which again didn’t work and then was able to drive it forward to the back yard where he moved it to be parked. I had the tow truck driver write me a statement of his actions and responsibility for the vehicles transmission being broken, which he did on the invoice for the tow. I then paid for the tow and went back to the office.","Corrective actions

The best corrective action would be to not place yourself in the path of lightning in the first place; however being that the area we work in is associated with weather events, the best corrective action we could take in the future is to recognize the situation and turn all vehicles off including the radios and wait out the storm the way we did.","08/17/2011 00:00"

There was no communication between the lighter and any other fire personnel.

The following is a detailed account, including approximate times of this incident.

7-31-2011

1616 Winds increased and light showers started. OPS pulled people from line and back to the road because of wind and snag hazards.

1845 Spots below the road began picking up possibly due to wind. It soon became apparent that fire was being introduced and someone was lighting a line of fire to the southwest quartering downhill. Crews were alerted, vehicles and buggies were moved, OPS completed a roll call of overhead and module leaders to find the source of the lighting. Everyone was accounted for.

1945 The IC3 and SOF2 suspected the source of the ignition, they then walked a spur road, he was thought to have taken. At the truck they were joined by a hotshot Sup. and an IA module leader. The lighter then walked out of the timber with line gear on and a drip torch, headed back to his truck.

When asked if he lit the spots he responded, 'yes' admitting 'I screwed up, I shouldn't have done that,” and apologized.

Members of the group informed the lighter of the ramifications of his actions. When asked if he realized this was not an acceptable action or procedure before he started, he again responded 'yes'.

The IC3 stayed with the lighter and called the District Ranger, Forest FMO and Forest AFMO informing them of the situation. All resources were pulled back to camp and later the IC3, SOF2, and IHC Sups. returned to camp.

Due to poor burning conditions and relocation of the vehicles and crews, personnel were never endangered.

2030 The IC3 and SOF2 spoke with IHC Sups. and overhead from each crew and module. All were very disturbed by the action as it related to their safety, professionalism, basic communication, chain of command and protocols for managing fire for resource benefit/objectives.

The IC3 gave everyone the option of being demobed if they felt uncomfortable with the situation. One IHC crew requested demob at 2215. All others decided to stay.

2130 The Lighter met with remaining overhead and module/crew leaders and apologized for his actions while listening to their concerns. The IC3 again offered to demob anyone not comfortable with this situation -still no takers.

8-1-2011

0600 After discussion and crew vote, the second IHC crew requested to demob and were released from the fire. All other personnel stayed.

Conclusion:

-Safety Principles Compromised

-Failure to communicate intent of firing

-Fire was introduced downhill/downwind of personnel without the approval or knowledge of the IC3 or anyone else assigned to the fire.

-Professionalism

-Example set for young, beginning crewmembers

-Protocols for fire managed for resource benefit / management objectives.

-Not adhering to chain of command. IC had delegation to manage fire and actions should go through him.

-No realization of ramification of this action.

-Safety concerns of crews

-Disregard for standards, policies and principals of management","1.Group discussions were held imediately after this incident with IHC sups.and all overhead and crew / module leaders. Briefing and discussions again at 8-1-2011 morning brief.

Okanogan Division Radios

The Okanogan Division of the Okanogan Wenatchee National Forest has been experiencing trouble communicating with the Central Washington Interagency Communications Center (CWICC). This problem began to become more noticeable in May 2011. With the arrival of fire season, and many wilderness/trails people being in the backcountry this has become an urgent safety issue.

The Methow Valley Ranger District, the Tonasket Ranger District, the North Cascades Smokejumper Base (NCSB) and CWICC are all affected. CWICC is only able to communicate intermittently with these resources including the smokejumper aircraft and other operation aircraft working on the Division.

Last night the Methow Valley Ranger District fire resources (1 – 12 person hand crew and 2 engines) responded to a fire that was reported around 1730. Other resources that responded were Okanogan County Fire District 6, engines from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) South Okanogan Unit and a (DNR) type 2 helicopter with helitack crew. The last resources to leave the fire arrived at their home unit at 0115 this morning. This problem (line noise) began at 2034 effectively cutting off communications from dispatch to the fire.

At the local level, the Eastern Washington communications staff and CWICC have worked their hardest to solve the problem, communications have not yet improved. This problem needs to be elevated to the next level to help solve the problem of this impending safety issue.

The issue seems to be centered around phone lines that connect dispatch in Wenatchee, WA to Okanogan County, WA. The local telephone technicians have not been able to isolate the problem to a specific location just a general area. From what we understand the fix could be to move the line to a clean circuit.","Filing this safenet","07/24/2011 00:00"

At this time all personnel spotted and observed a military helicopter approaching from the southwest and perform a low level reconnaissance over the fire. The helicopter was dark green with a red or pink stripe near the tail of the aircraft and may have been a Blackhawk. No radio contact was made with the IC.

During the low level recon, the fire was fully staffed in an area of mixed conifer with multiple snags and steep terrain. The rotor wash and lack of communication with personnel posed a real hazard for firefighters on the ground. This unexpected arrival of the helicopter was also a hazard because of earlier air operations conducted in the area by air attack Bravo 6. Again, there was never any communications with ground personnel.

After the low level flight, the crew finished with mop up for the day, headed down the hill and arrived at forest road 439 at approximately 1830. At this time the crew was preparing to leave in the trucks and head back to the district office when the same helicopter was spotted approaching from the east towards the fire with what appeared to be a full bucket with a short lead. The crew could not see the fire from our position on the road but the helicopter heading in that direction and in a couple of minutes was seen leaving the fire area with what appeared to be an empty bucket heading to the northeast. At no time during this incident was contact made with the IC or was an order placed for a helicopter on this fire.

It is unknown whether or not the helicopter landed and removed bucket or traveled back to station still attached.

Points of Concern

•	No communication with ground forces putting firefighters in danger

•	 Aircraft did not get a briefing

•	Aircraft was not familiar with strategies and tactics

•	Dipping out of an unapproved dip site

•	No ability to flight follow locally

•	Unfamiliar with local aerial hazards

Potential Hazards

•	Dumping water on firefighters

•	Low level drop causing fire to flare up

•	Resource damage

•	Landing in an unapproved landing zone

•	Aircraft malfunction without ability to warn ground resources

•	Mid-air collision with other aircraft

•	Bucket drop breaking limbs from weakened trees onto firefighters","Reported to Forest Fire Staff, Forest Aviation Officer, State of New Mexico Fire Management Officer, Regional Assistant Director of Fire Operations.","07/21/2011 00:00"

During initial attack on the first day a smoke jumper found a small rattlesnake that had been burned and was dead. The snake was seen on the edge of the burned oak brush beneath the rock face on the top side of the fire. My concerns were that there were probably more snakes in the area due to the rocky terrain and the hazards they will pose with mop-up procedures that will follow later on. I contacted all the supervisors on the fire to brief their personnel, on the hazards of rattlesnakes in the area. The supervisors copied the transmission. No other snakes were seen on the fire the rest of that day. The next day in briefing mop-up assignments were given to the supervisors. I failed to discuss the rattlesnake hazard in the briefing due to the same personnel and same mop-up tactics from the previous day. The assignment was to cold trail a chain in off the line. Half of the 20 person crew was to work on the timbered flank and the other half was to work along the oak brush flank and tie into the jumpers. At 0930 the jumpers had tied into the grass that had been cold trailed the day before. The module working in the oak brush had about a chain left before tying in with the jumpers. At 0938 one of the crew members in the module shouted rattlesnake, during this time I was at the heel of the fire doing some paper work and planning for demob. A jumper turned to look towards the shout and saw the victim pick up the 10 inch rattlesnake by the tail. Before the jumper could say anything the rattlesnake struck the firefighters thumb and the victim was shaking his hand trying to get it to release. The snake then released and escaped into a deep rock crevice. The jumper hurried over and assessed the situation. The victim had one puncture wound on his thumb that was bleeding. The smoke jumper yelled to me that there is a medical situation with a rattlesnake bite and that we need a medivac. At 0939 I called dispatch on the repeater and requested a flight for life helicopter and the victim to be taken to a hospital with anti-venom. Personnel involved moved him to the medivac site 30 yards away keeping the victim calm and had him keep his hand down below the heart. Once at the medivac site a quick medical history was taken and we kept checking his pulse every 5 minutes. There were no EMTs on scene, so I had dispatch contact the hospital and asked for any further instructions on rattlesnake bites. The victims thumb went numb at 0942 and was swelling. At 0955 I requested to dispatch to get air-attack up over the fire to have communications with flight for life on victor. 0959 dispatch called back with doctors instructions. We had done everything that the doctor had suggested to do. At 1009 the patients arm from the elbow down was numb and he was getting nauseous. Flight for life was on scene at 1020 and the medics started treatment at 1025. The patient information was passed on to the medics during treatment. The patient was loaded into the air-craft at 1044 and lifted off the medivac site enroute to the hospital at 1047. When the fire was called controlled, all personnel hiked off the fire and an AAR was conducted with all fire personnel in the meadow below the fire before being released. Points covered in the AAR with the rattlesnake incident were: don’t mess with any snake and vacate the area if possible, when cold trailing use a tool to make noise in places where one can’t see, make sure to pay close attention on where one’s hand is being placed, and express the hazard to all personnel in the area.","","07/25/2011 00:00"

The aerial ignition would begin mid slope and end 100 yards above (upslope) from Rd 266. Unburned fuels east of the structure on Road 266T were to be hand ignited. The unburned fuel between Road 266 and the aerial ignition were to be ignited by hand and progress east toward the previously established black along road 266. This would close the remaining segment of line on the incident. Night shift was to transition in and assist with holding and lighting as the operation progressed. The operation was in Division Quebec (Div Q) with Division Tango (Div T) being the adjacent Division (west) ignited the previous night shift. Div T was in holding and mop up status at this time.

1733 Operational briefing at La Jare Medivac helispot in Div Q.

The Operation Section Chief Trainee (OSC) met with the Branch Director, DIVS Quebec, DIVS Tango, and 5 IHC Superintendants to brief on the evening’s operation. Transition of night resources was not timely - some night shift resources were late and not present at this briefing. They were subsequently briefed by Branch and DIVS Q upon their arrival on line and incorporated into the operation as initially intended.

Concluding the primary briefing the OSC informed the assembled personnel he would then:

•	Return to helibase to retrieve the PSD.

•	Would return to Div Q and perform an orientation orbit of the ignition area with the pilot and PSD operator.

•	After completing the orientation orbit the ignition operation would go live on the next pass.

Upon Liftoff from helibase the OSC used Air to Ground to inform Air Attack and the Branch Director they were airborne and returning to Div Q.

Upon completion of the recon/orientation orbit the OSC announced over Air to Ground the orientation was complete and was ready to start ignition.

There was no confirmation or acknowledgement of either of these two radio transmissions by ground resources.

1849 – Aerial ignition begins. Crew assigned to structure protection was in place along cabin road, and positioned in unburned to accomplish hand ignition burnout around cabin. Unassigned IHC personnel were also in the area scouting. Significant reburn potential existed in the area ignited the previous day.

1943 – Aerial ignition completed.

Issue: Commencing of aerial ignition using PSD without acknowledging confirmation from ground forces of their being aware of commencement of operations and are clear of the area. Reports varied stating spheres were dropped within 30 to 50 feet of their location. Temperatures, RH’s, and low fuel moistures yielded rapid development of fire line from spheres which rapidly transitioned to a very active flame front with some torching/crowning and reigniting of the black ignited the previous day. Personnel immediately left the area and avoided injury.","SOF1-T assembled this report using input provided by the OSC/Burn Boss, Branch Director, DIVS Q, DIVS T, 3 IHC Superintendants, IHC Squad Boss, and Div T SOF.    A line meeting was arranged to discuss and facilitate resolution of the issue. Present were the OSC-T, Branch Director, SOF1-Trainee, DIVS Q, DIVS T, SOF2 for DIV T, DIV T Trainee, 3 IHC Superintendants, and IHC Squad Boss.

•	The Burn Boss will confirm communication with ground forces that personnel have vacated the burn area and the aerial ignition operation is clear to proceed. Supervisors of Ground forces share the responsibility to insure this communication loop is concluded. Firing operations will have standard protocol ensuring all forces are informed when firing operations are to begin. Firing and line operations supervisors will ensure all personnel have been informed and take appropriate measures to ensure all personnel are in safe locations and that the communications feedback has taken place.

•	Ensure transition of personnel from day to night is complete and personnel are briefed and in place prior to the beginning of firing operation.

Units in the field were unable to contact dispatchers for assistance during a severe thunderstorm and lightning event. Numerous lightning fires were occuring around the forest, fire personnel were actively suppressing these fires and in a couple locations were unaware that they no longer had contact with dispatch.

Aircraft in the air was not able to contact dispatch through either local or national radio channels.

It was determined that the UPS system currently installed had been done so incorrectly and that all of the electric needs of the entire SO and District office had been directed at that UPS system, which caused undo draw on the system which led to the 2 hour power backup that had been experienced and in fact should have lasted many more hours.

There were multiple thunderstorms impacting field units throughout the duration of this event, torrential rainfall and strong gusty winds.

The Regional Forester advised them to stage near the highway until his arrival. We arrived at 1330 hrs (2.5 hr. drive) and debriefed with BIA personnel. An attempt was made to contact the IC with no results. No VFD equipment or personnel were present at the incident. The Regional Forester contacted an Emergency Management Service office (EMS) who had taken over the fire the previous day and then had given the fire back to the VFD later that night (7/7/2011). Understanding this, a second attempt was made to contact the VFD IC who answered his cell phone stating he was not aware of having the fire given back to him. He was currently out of town at the time and a VFD engine should be on scene. We informed him it was not present. At this time the Regional Forester asked him if he wanted BIA resources to assume command of the fire and he answered yes. The fire had burned onto trust land consuming 20 acres. A BIA person assumed command of the fire at that time and organized his resources to respond to the north end to see where the fire was. A major freeway and highway were utilized by VFD personnel to burn from ending along private property further north. Observations indicated their firing had stopped due to the inability to ignite the grass. The VFD personnel had fired west along Highway 9 to a private road and proceeded north alongside the road. The land owner also helped in fighting this fire. Their firing ended with no tie in point. The fire was observed moving through the hardwood litter below. Upon scouting ahead the fire was moving freely down to the turn pike. The decision was made to go direct and tie into the bottom black. The SOFR deemed this as appropriate and personnel conducted line construction thereafter.","As the SOFR upon hearing what was said by the engine boss and seeing moderate fire activity agreeded with the decision to pull back to a safe area until other BIA personnel arrived. The IC conducted a briefing outlining strategy and tactics stressing powerlines, gas wells in the area and freeway traffic. Their suppression actions and safety were satisfactory as they proceeded to start line constructio.

Since the fire had burned onto BIA trust lands the regional office sent personnel back to the fire the following day. I asked questions about the firing operations from the previous day and was told this was normal for a volunteer fire department to do things this way all the time when fighting any fire. The regional office has been dealing with this for years and stresses firefighter safety at all times. The only time they engage in fighting fies is when trust lands burn.","07/11/2011 00:00"

It is not directed to any person or organization only a heads up. Fire Operations (LLAK9F5200) radio allotment consists of approximately sixty radios. Attached is a spreadsheet with the radio number, date it was returned for repair, and the issue the radio had. To date, 7/8/2011, twenty three radios have been returned. Only two have had damage from use, for example one broken screen and one broken antenna. There is an alarming number of radios that are experiencing receiving and transmitting issues.

I cannot speak for all of the radio RX/TX issues as I did not check all of them prior to return for repair. However, my radio was one that would not transmit or receive. I was ICT3(t) on Little Creek Fire #246. I programmed in the Command Channel verified the settings and internal programming compared to the ICT3's radio, everything matched. I could not key the repeater or receive even when attached to a larson antenna. I rechecked all of the programming and internal settings. Everything was identical even compared when several different radios.

If the spreadsheet did not attach properly you can contact me and I will fax or mail it.","I have kept a spreadsheet with the problems that we have experienced and kept my supervisor up to date with the issues.","07/08/2011 00:00"

Had division briefing at 0700. The TFLD notified me that the Crew Boss from the crew (type II-IA) left to get his tire repaired. I asked the TFLD if the crew had a qualified CRWB. He was not sure. I got in contact with the CRWB (T) and asked if he had a qualified CRWB to work with and he said no.

The crew at that time was called back and held in spike camp until the CRWB returned.

310-1 on page 5109.14 of the Standards for Fire and FIre Aviation Operations was reviewed with the CRWB upon his return. This portion of the red book states the crew must have a qualified CRWB.

The crew was assigned to sharpen and refurbish their tools and chainsaw and help in camp until the CRWB returned.","This issue was covered during the IMT planning meeting with no mention of the specific crew. The crew agency rep was then given the details in private.","07/09/2011 00:00"

The crew yelled, “ROCKS” repeatedly to warn everyone of the danger. The crew members directly below the rocks could hear the warning yells and over their radio crew net but their vision of the rocks was obscured by oak brush.

The first large rock, the size of a “Volkswagen Beetle”, was successfully avoided but another rock, 2 feet by 2 feet, hit a crew member pinning him to the ground. The first crew member to the patient moved the rock off the patient.

The first EMT was with the patient within one minute and three additional EMT’s from the crew were on scene within five minutes of the accident.

The crew net channel was cleared for the medical emergency. The four EMT’s began their assessment of the patient. The Command Channel was cleared by the Division Supervisor.

Patient vital signs were stable.

The initial request was for an ambulance to respond but this was upgraded to a helicopter short haul mission by the DIVS due to the mechanism of injury.

A satellite phone was brought into the mix to aid in communications with Incident Communications and medical personnel at the ICP.

By 14:18 a cervical collar was in place, the patient’s legs were splinted, the patient secured to a backboard and placed in a SKED. The patient was then moved away from the rock-slide area.

At 14:25 the incident short haul capable helicopter was performing their size up from the air.

At 14:55 the patient was packaged for transport by short haul personnel.

At 15:23 the patient was short hauled to the landing zone where the helicopter could be re-configured to transport the patient to the hospital.

At 15:32 the helicopter left the landing zone with the patient en-route to the trauma center hospital in Santa Fe, New Mexico.","The crews on scene did an excellent job in handling the patient and in patient packaging, which decreased the scene time for the short haul personnel. The crews had the EMT’s, c-collar, backboard and SKED with them.

The crews involved conducted an After Action Review immediately after the incident and obtained witness statements from those involved.

The IMT’s two SOF-1 and an SOF1 (T) met with the personnel involved at 18:45 at their spike camp and conducted an AAR and investigation.

Crew personnel took photos of the accident site and a NIFC photographer also took photos of the extraction.

Communications followed the ICS 206 Block 8 for obtaining initial information from the Point of Contact.

The IMT followed the team’s Incident Emergency Plan    Initial AAR and Lessons Learned:

The IMT needs to make sure the ICS 206 shows the capability of the medical resources available. On this incident the ICS 206 did not show that the medevac helicopter was also short haul capable. This may have delayed the initial request for a short haul.

The IMT needs to continue to train and drill with incident communication personnel. This can be a challenge as RADO’s are not assigned to the team and those assigned have a variety of experience and backgrounds. (Although on this incident the RADO’s performed well)

The crews involved felt that understanding the short haul process was important. The crews who had short haul experience felt less stress than the crew that did not understand the short haul process. (Initial recon and size-up, landing to re-configure for short haul, insertion of short haul personnel, recovery of short haul personnel and patient, landing to re-configure for patient transport inside the ship)

The AAR with the crew also expressed that the agencies are not supporting the crew medic concept with medical control, IV capability, etc.

The IMT will continue to assign line medics to divisions based on access, division assignment and medic availability.

An AAR with Incident Communications was also conducted. Lessons learned:

Best practice is to turn communications over to ICP medical personnel when talking with medical personnel with the patient.

The communications room needs to be cleared of non-essential personnel with no side conversations in the room.

The IMT must ensure that whenever air transport is requested that secondary ground transport is also provided as a backup plan. This was done initially but then that ambulance was diverted to the helibase before the patient had been transported to the hospital.

The use of a satellite phone aided in communication.

Additional fire priority traffic can be considered by Communications depending on the situation. During this incident ATGS called to advise of a weather alert of a large thunderstorm approaching the fire. ATGS was denied air time for this alert. The AAR with Communications determined that depending on the situation and status of the initial emergency that other critical information could be disseminated over the Command Frequency.

An AAR with the Helitac Crew was also conducted. Lessons learned:

The presence of a helitac crew managing the dip site below the accident site expedited the constructed of the helispot and control of the helispot.

The emergency was not communicated to ATGS in a timely manner.","07/04/2011 00:00"

I was completing the process of check-in at 2200 on that day and personally observed rapid rates of spread and 4-8 ft flame lengths in and around structures in Hondo, NM and in Alamo Canyon. On 6/30/11 this dozer was assigned to me as a part of the operational plan for the day. When introduced to the Dozer operator, I noticed dressings on his left hand and right ear. Upon query, he stated that he had recieved burn injuries the night before when he was 'burned over.' When asked if he had been to medical or had reported the incident, he stated that he had not and seemed concerned that he would loose his assignment if he did so.

I immediately sent him to the medical unit and notivied DIVS and Safety. Later that evening, the Type III team that had been managing the fire transitioned to a Type II team. I notified the Type II team safety, and he interviewed the dozer operator. At no time was the dozer operator taken off of duty or taken to a hospital. Closer inspection of the burn injuries showed burns to the middle, ring, and pinkie fingers of the left hand and also to the tip of the right ear, with blistering and peeling of skin and raw, bloody discharge. The Dozer operator continued to self-treat the injuries with burn cream for the duration of the incident (11 more shifts).

Over the course of the remaining shifts, I was able to personally interview several of the parties involved and to see the entrapment/burnover site. Several of the personnel questioned stated that 'I could see that the Dozer was in a bad place, but couldn't get through to him on TAC (because there was too much traffic).' The Dozer operator stated that he was working alone, and had been directed to push line about 80' in front of an active edge that was burning downhill towards the houses. A wind switch then caused the fire to 'burn as though someone had poured gasoline on it.' The dozer operator stated that he knew that he was not going to be able to outrun the fire, so he turned the dozer towards the fire and punched his way through the flame front. It was at this time, he stated, that he recieved the burn injuries.

I believe that the Dozer operator did become entrapped and was truly burned over. Upon arrival at home unit after DMOB, I was surprised to discover that this incident had not been reported or investigated.","I am filing a SAFENET to ensure that this incident has been reported in some fashion. Since I was not directly present for the accident but instead viewed only the aftermath, I do not feel comfortable making judgements regarding the how/why/when of the burnover incident.","07/19/2011 00:00"

After some work on the phone lines, they thought they had resolved all issues with incoming calls and the phones worked for two days then started to work intermittently. On June 29, 2011 the phone lines had gone down completely and no calls could be received in dispatch during a Red Flag Warning and lightning in the area.

Because of this, the 911 Dispatch had a helicopter respond along with Durango Fire Dispatch. A safecom will be filed on the two helicopters to the same fire without them knowing about each other. Communication issues need to be fixed in the dispatch center so we have contact with outside resources and the public via phone.

While Engine 2423 was driving south on Hwy 395 north of Burns, OR, the Engine Captain felt a jolt and a sudden shift of weight. The Driver’s-side rear wheels separated from the Engine and traveled across the roadway striking the right front of a passenger vehicle heading north on Hwy 395. The Engine stopped a short direction pass the vehicle staying within their lane resting on the left rear hub. The engine and passenger vehicle were towed to Burns for repair.

The initial investigation indicated that the lug nuts had loosened, causing the wheels to separate from the engine. The engine crew had removed the wheels for maintenance and had put them back on the vehicle using a ¾ inch impact gun on the morning of June 29th. The engine crew went directly to a tire center to for re-torque of the lug nuts before going to the field per SOPs. The tire center did not have a torque wrench large enough to fit the lug nuts. The tire center offered to put the tire center’s impact gun on the lug nuts. The crew stated that they had used an impact gun to put the lug nuts back on just prior to visiting the tire center. They refused the offer and then proceed to the field.","The Engine Captains within the Fire Zone are come up a detail process to change tire in the field.

I am at the home unit and cannot expand on the problems since I do not have first-hand info but these concerns are legitimate. Please contact any of the R-5 Hotshot Crews assigned or Div X-Ray  for corrective actions taken, and actions needed in the future.

My request is for Region 5 Risk Management to contact the HS crews assigned and the DIVS and share lessons learned through a FLA.

Due to the long drive it was recommanded that the camp crew spend the night at the mob center in Alb. NM. After spending the night the crew started travel to the Horse Shoe 2 incident (June 8th) and started their shift after check-in at the incident.

From the Osha incident to the Horse Shoe 2 Incident (June 2 to June 23, 2011)the Crew worked a total of 22 days straight without R & R.

The Camp Crew Boss indicated that the crew was coming off another incident during check-in at the Horse Shoe 2 fire, but was told that it will be ok. According to the crew performance evaluation by the FACL it stated that 'Horse Shoe 2 Inprocessing gave the crew an incorrect opion on the length of time they would be able to work before time out.

A SAFECOM was also written on this subject, but I felt that since ground forces were involved in both of these incidents, it should also be considered for SAFENET publication as well.

Both of these incidents had commonality in that ground forces had requested directly to the helicopter to change to a different target area. Not necessarily to a different target, as that is common practice. These both were the movement to an entirely different area of the fire that meant that the helicopters flew into areas that had been restricted by horizontal means (fences, IP’s etc.), or vertically restricted (ceilings or hard decks). Most importantly where other aircraft were operating. In these cases fixed wing retardant drops were being done in the area. This was a fairly complex airspace, and when that is the case there are many clearances and restrictions that are required by aerial supervision in order to ensure safety. It is also done to make the operation as efficient as possible. In the incident I was involved in, I was unable to ascertain whether or not the ground firefighter was in a position to physically see that we were conducting retardant ops.

This is not an attempt to place blame; the reason I did not list, aircraft tail numbers, or radio call signs of ground personnel involved. All we really have in the air is “radio” communication, and in a complex airspace it is not only difficult at times, but crucial. In one case there were assumptions made by at least two parties (including myself). It must be pointed out that the helicopter did ask me before they moved, but the request was simply for higher altitude. I actually cleared him, but with the assumption that it was different targets in the area he had been working in. In fact he would have been cleared there as well, it would simply require a bit more coordination. This is, in fact, how we continued to operate for the rest of the shift.","I asked that air attack call the individual on the ground, and request that they not move aircraft out of the immediate target area; that they make that request through aerial supervision. I reiterated to the helicopter crew that they not move until we are all clear on where this new area is. I also suggested that it be brought up at the helibase briefing the next morning. Whether that happened or not, I don’t know as I was not in attendance.

Long term: While I’m not sure if this is a building trend, it is nothing new, and I do think that it might be worth a bullet statement in the IRPG. I will suggest to the Interagency Aerial Supervision Steering Committee take on that task, and report to the OWDC. I would also make a recommendation that the IASSC push a recommendation to NIACC that formal training be done with all helicopter contracts. This would be akin to NAFA but at a regional and/or state level.","06/25/2011 00:00"

Three Public Information Officer (PIO) trainees working on their taskbooks had yet to complete S130/190 or deploy a practice fire shelter. The PIOF (t) communicated this concern to the lead PIO2 (t) who acted on a valuable opportunity by setting up a local training session to meet training needs. The SOF2(t) working with the Southern Area Incident Management Team led the training, hitting on PPE, situational awareness, and protocols for deploying a fire shelter, placing special emphasis on prevention measures.

During the training, the SOF2(t) discovered the strapping on his line gear had slipped over his shelter, preventing him access to quickly pull his shelter if ever needed. This teachable moment showed all the importance of checking the condition of line gear and shelters on a regular basis.

During our debriefing, we discussed several points to consider in the event of a deployment. This includes psychological and physical conditions being in a shelter might present as well as the importance of routinely checking line gear. The PIO2(t) also discussed PIO conduct and responsibilities for media escorts while on the line. In the end, three information officers and one FFT2(t) were timed during practice shelter deployments to complete training requirements.

Fire shelter training is essential for PIOs because they are responsible for escorting media personnel on fire lines. It is important they be prepared to adequately brief media on PPE, fire shelter use, watch out situations, and proper conduct while escorting media. Mental and physical preparedness is essential. Information Officers have a responsibility to protect the welfare of themselves, the media, and the other people they supervise. Opportunities such as these are excellent reminders to PIOs of their obligations.

As of June 1st, 2011 all PIOF trainees are required to have taken basic fire school training. Additionally all Public Information Officers will need to take fire training refresher annually, which will include fire shelter training. Prior to becoming a PIO2, Information Officers must first be qualified as a PIOF, as listed in the Wildland Fire Qualifications System Guide DMS-310-1.","N/A","06/24/2011 00:00"

While prepping a house one of the crew members suffered from a possible cyanide exposure. The crew member complained of a headache and stomach problems shortly after coming into contact with suspected cyanide. Information was passed up the chain of command and the crew reported to the Medical Unit at base camp in Reserve New Mexico. Some of the Medical personnel thought that the crew member was suffering from heat exhaustion. A phone call was placed to the poison control center and they advised me to watch over crew member through the night. The Safety Officer Trainee was present during the conversation with the Medical Unit personnel. I was told to watch over my crewmember through the night and that in the case of her condition getting worse that I was to wake up Medical Unit personnel. There was no game plan as far what we were to do with our sick crew member the next morning and the crew member was never treated that night for heat exhaustion and the OWCP Specialist informed us that there was no paperwork or documentation to be filled out since there was no nature of injury or illness. The morning of 6/19/2011 the crew member still had a headache and had not slept much the night before. I took the crew member with me along with the rest of the engine crew back to Luna New Mexico and tied in with our strike team leader and Structure Division Group Leader. I informed the Division of my crew member’s health and he instructed me just to keep monitoring her we also talked about in the case of her symptoms becoming stronger that we would take her to the Luna Fire Dept. where an EMT and ambulance where staffed. After the briefing with Division we headed out to the line with instruction not to commit crew into suppression efforts and just to monitor for spots along road way. About an hour after leaving Luna the crew member stated that she was having difficulty breathing and that her headache had worsened along with stomach pains and nausea. At this time I took the crew member back to Luna Fire Dept. and to the EMT who called the Poison Control Center again. I also called the Safety Officer and informed him that we were taking the crew member to the Luna Fire Dept. to have her checked out by the EMT and he said that he was sending over a Safety Line Officer to help out. The Poison Control Center advised the EMT to bring the crew member to the GILA Hospital in Silver City, New Mexico. I had passed this information up the chain of command to my strike team leader and division on two different occasions once when the crew member’s symptoms worsened and again when the poison control center asked for the crew member to be transported to Silver City. The Division Leader met with me face to face at the Fire Dept. and was good with her getting the proper treatment he also said that he would tie in with the Safety Line Officer when he arrived and inform him of the decision to send the crew member to the hospital. I rode with my crew member to the hospital upon arrival they performed a blood test which came back negative for cyanide. I called the Safety Line Officer Trainee and informed him of the news and that we would need a ride back to base camp as the crew member was going to be released that evening. The Safety Officer asked me if he was to commit the funds and send somebody from ground support would we actually be there. I asked him to clarify his question because it confused me. The Safety Officer than asked if this was a training exercise for him. I responded that it was not a training exercise and that we needed a ride back to camp and that I needed to meet with him that night. Ground Support was sent and we headed back to Base Camp where the driver informed me that he had specific instructions to take me directly to the Medical Unit along with sick crew member. At the Medical Unit I was asked who authorized the ambulance to take the crew member to Silver City. I stated that I had passed that information up the chain of command and asked them if they thought I was operating outside of the scope of my duty as a supervisor. They responded yes and that they had copies of the Radio Logs from the day’s events and that there was never any authorization to send the crew member to the hospital therefor the crew member would be responsible for the cost incurred from the ambulance. I informed them that I would error on the side of caution every time and that ultimately I am responsible for my crew’s safety and that it would not be them who would have to answer to the crew members parents and family if the worst possible scenario had played out. I left the medical unit and found my strike team leader and Division Leader and the three of us went and had a conversation with the Safety Officer Trainee. The safety officer informed us that it was him who had printed out the radio log sheets because he had thought that the entire scenario was a training assignment. He apologized and assured me that everything would be taken care of. The Safety Officer also stated to my Division Leader that he was unaware that the Safety Line Officer he had sent to meet us at the Luna Fire Dept. had been informed of the situation and that he was good with us sending the crew member to the hospital via the ambulance. The morning of 6/20/2011 I called my home district OWCP Specialist and informed her of the past day’s events. I informed her that I had left in the ambulance without taking the proper documentation (CA-1, CA-16) with me. She instructed me to find the Finance Section Chief and get the CA-1 and CA-16 documented. She also said that she had passed the information along to the State of Idaho BLM personnel and that they felt that I had done what I needed to do in order to provide proper care for crew member and that they were supporting my decisions 150%. The reason why I have documented this situation on SAFENET is for the fact that in our business of firefighting we travel away from our home districts, forests and parks all the time. We can be lulled into the mindset that fire leadership and support services are always looking out for our best interests and for the most part they are. What we need not to forget is that the human element is present at all times. My crew member came into contact with cyanide which was confirmed by a homeland security officer and the medical unit wanted to treat her for heat exhaustion the two illnesses share the same symptoms and they were failing to error on the side of caution. The situation was made only more complex by a Safety Officer thinking that the whole event was a training exercise. At the time I felt like I had no support from anyone on the IMT except for my Strike Team Leader and Division Leader. I had to press the issue in order to provide for the well-being of my crew and when I did I was told that my actions were being reviewed by the IMT. I have no problem with this my only concern was that of my crew. I sat down with the medical unit leaders and had an after action review in which we discussed how my crew member was sent back with me the first night so that I could watch over her. Looking back that was my first mistake I should have insisted that she be taken to the hospital immediately for further care instead she was sent with me I have no medical background besides first responder. I communicated to the medical unit that only compounded the situation and ultimately led to her being transported by ambulance the next day. The medical unit informed me that they had planned on taking the crew member in the next day if symptoms had persisted. That game plan was never communicated to me I was never told to report back to the medical unit in the morning only told that they thought she was suffering from heat exhaustion which she was never treated for. The ball had been thrown back into my court when they had sent the crew member with me so that I could watch over her and I took action the next morning. Ultimately we as firefighters are responsible for our own safety we should never be afraid to press an issue regarding this. Never forget to step outside of a situation and act upon your own instinct especially when faced with safety of crew.","I sat down with the medical unit leaders and had an after action review in which we discussed how my crew member was sent back with me the first night so that I could watch over her.

At 0200 ground support called communications on the logistics net to report an 'incident within an incident': a structure fire in the ICP and two drivers reported smoke inhalation. Operations Section Chief was contacted by telephone to coordinate a response to the fire, however communications was unable to contact the medical unit. The Medical Unit Leader was called by telephone, but did not answer his cell phone, and no phone number was provided to communications for the medical unit. No one in medical responded to calls on the logistics net. Additionally, neither of the incident safety officers responded to calls placed to their cell phones. Personnel from the communications unit had to leave the unit and wake the medics and safety officer in their tents to deal with the situation.

This situation could have resulted in serious medical consequences to the two drivers with smoke inhalation.","Approximately five days prior to this incident, Communications unit staff had met with the Medical Unit Leader to express concerns about lack of nighttime communications with medical personnel.

This fire was 20 mi north of Venetie, AK on the Chandelar River. The fire was 60 acres in mixed black spruce, white spruce, willow, birch, and aspen. The fire burned deep causing all trees in the fire area to up-root and fall, creating a “jack-straw” mess. As a result, creating much saw work.

Through the fire duration, we had a total of 28 chain saws on this fire and experienced many saw issues. One out every two saws we had ceased to run after minimal use. This was a safety hazard on many fronts. Having dependable chain-saws plays a key role in safety throughout the initial and extended attack phase. Wasted time spent working on a broken saw is pivotal in catching and securing a fire. For every minute a saw is down, the fire is generating more work equalling longer duration of time spent on the incident. Every broken saw that can not be remedied in the field, a replacement saw must be flown in via helicopter or para-cargo. This creates more exposure time, flight hours of getting more saws delivered, and more saw work carving out additional heli-spots and/or saw work to retrieve the para-cargo.

Saws also play a key role in creating a safe work environment eliminating hazard trees from work and camp areas. Not having reliable saws can lead to a lax attitude in elimination of over-head hazards. Chainsaws also are essential in a rapid assembly of an emergency heli-spot. In many realms, a saw with issues not only jeopardizes production but more importantly, SAFETY is jeopardized.","As saws went down, more were ordered from the AFS warehouse.","06/22/2011 00:00"

The fire made several large downhill runs down into the flats. This incident being reported occurred in the flats which was a grass and mesquite component burning. Fire behavior was extreme for multiple days. Two days prior of this incident being reported, the fire was burning in a heavy brush component, burned through a small community and destroyed nearly every structure with an estimated 47 structures lost during its downhill run.

This event being reported took place on June 16th after it once again made another large downhill run and once again burned structures down. This fire was extreme this day which also resulted in a large downhill run and jumped 5+ lanes of highway and jump into the flats and started to run through residential areas.

2 Task Forces of engines responded down 3 Canyons Road in attempt to locate an anchor point after the fire jumped the highway. The fire was burning in a north east direction through grass and mesquite. Once units got to the eastern flank of the fire we then noticed another fire further east about 500 to 1000' feet east of the main body of fire. This fire was located on the south side of 3 Canyons Road. I then noticed an AZ CNF pickup truck with a white camper shell parked on the south side of 3 Canyons Road and someone one geared up burning on the south side of the fire with a fussee. This fire was being lit with no direction from the team, the local task force, and was never communicated with anyone in the area, they had no anchor point, and no location on where the fire was going to be taken to. There were houses off to the south and east a short distance and this action just brought fire closer to these residences. This individual was not red carded at the arduous level at the time. This person was carded at the moderate level and should not have been working in the field outside their carded level.

Later resources got together to try to figure out the benefit of that back firing operations would have accomplished. Nothing could be determined on how the lighting of fire in this location would have been beneficial.

Items of concern were this individual was not red carded for this job at hand, had no anchor point, resulted in a more fire moving closer to values at risk and fire ground personnel, the person was working alone, did not communicate with nearby resources and when questioned did not have an answer of what the intentions where.

A couple days later there was another start (garden fire), this same individual was seen lighting fires around a wind generator that was surrounded by dirt in the same fuel type. The wind generator was at no risk from the fire in the fuel types around it. Once again no communications with ground resources, no direction on what the outcome of the firing operation was to be, the backfire location was on the upwind side that generated a head fire later after retardant was dropped on it to slow it down. This head fire later moved towards crews that were burning in front of the main fire trying to put black in front of the head fire. This fire had potential to reach a critical corner that crews were out front trying to secure to stop the advancing fire. This fire that was lit was heading towards a direction that had numerous high value structures around the east and south ends.","Actions taken by me and other task force leaders were to put out the spot fire and continue on with our planned attack after informing the person on what was going on.

Specifically, field units who use Thorp Repeater as exclusive communications repeater in the upper west 1/3 of our ranger district are not capable of transmitting clear communication to the ranger station.

The repeater seems to be functioning properly, and at adequate strength, between field units. The problem arises when a field going unit attempts to make communication with the two base station radio sets in the main office of the ranger station. The ranger station base sets pick up mostly only loud static and incomprehensible voice. The safety concern here is that we are in violation of our communications protocol with regard to field units checking in for multiday backcountry/wilderness travel. We could potentially not be able to respond to an injury or incident in the wilderness/backcountry. Field units (i.e. wilderness rangers and trail crews) are required to check in 2x daily and confirm location according to established itineraries. The ranger station has not been able to keep satisfactory track of the location and duties of these units. The problem also seems to affect communication between dispatch (CWICC) in Wenatchee and field units at times. If an emergency (USFS or public) were to arise then communications could not be received in a clear and timely manner. This has been the case for weeks. The problem also seems to affect communication between dispatch (CWICC) in Wenatchee and field units at times.

A clearer, definitive, and well communicated contingency must be established and understood by all at the ranger district until the radio technicians can solve the issue. It really is not acceptable to just sit back and wait and say,” I think that was so and so checking in for the evening, or informing of a late return to the compound. I have no idea what they said but sounds like they are fine to me!”

I am aware that the problem may simply take weeks to solve. Perhaps all the district departments could pitch in some money and fund daily staffing of the Thorp Mountain Lookout until the problem is corrected. If the original base stations (that were replaced around the time the problem started) were returned and plugged back in maybe we'd find that they are not affected by whatever interference/static is creating the problem.

Update 9/26/2011: Repeater is completely non-functional due to batteries failing to recharge. This has also happened at times this summer.","We are attempting to mitigate this in a variety of ways: using the Fire Lookout at Thorp Mountain LO as a human repeater (not effective when she is on her off tour)or walking out onto the compound to use a hand held or rig radio for clearer communication with a field unit. These are not real mitigations, however, and one doesn’t have to think hard to see serious flaws in these options should an incident arise in the wilderness/backcountry requiring detailed elaborate communications.","09/26/2011 00:00"

The crews on the line had little or no direct interface with T2 team members. 2. This lack of communications went on for nearly 10 days, including but not limited lack of face-to-face briefing and written Incident action plans (IAPs). 3. Briefings that were conducted over the radio were chaos, and all the support from this team was confusing and not specific which did not focus on the NUMBER 1 priority (fire fighter safety). 4. The team focused on higher priorities in the north end of the fire and really left the Tribe and Agency hanging to make strategy and tactics without Incident management direction. 5. As mentioned, the Tribe and Agency did a commendable job taking care of strategy and tactics, the biggest concern was the lack of ALL logistical support, food, water, vehicle fuel, spike camps facilities, traffic plans. 6. Crews were commuting 3 hours every day to and from ICP to the fire (6 hours per day). 7. T2 team was overwhelmed and in a complete state of confusion which lead to chaos and mostly compromised our Number 1 priority, FIREFIGHTER SAFETY. 8. This continued through the T2 teams tour of 14 days.......WHY?...

Upon reaching and circling fire, we estimated the fire to be 15-20 acres. The fire was burning in Black Spruce and was 25% active burning mainly at the heel. The wind was 4-6 mph out of the NNW( as shown by the streamers). A jump spot was chosen approximately 200 yards to the south of the fire.

Two round jumpers were first and second on the load but due to the proximity of the duck and the need to get folks on the ground quickly, the 6 ram air jumpers were sent at approxiamtely 1515 with myself in the position of IC and JIC.

The 6 jumpers landed safely and began gathering our jump gear as the duck dropped on the active part of the fire. Jump 07 held off dropping cargo until the duck was clear of the airspace. After the duck was clear the cargo was kicked into the jump spot. The jump spot consisted of sporaqtic black spruce and most of the cargo as well as the jumpers' parachutes were hung up. At approximately 1530 I called Tanana dispatch on a sat phone and relayed that all jumpers were down and safe and that a sizeup would be forthcoming.

At approximately 1545 the fire began making runs at our jump spot. We gathered ou jump gear first and shuttled it to the black, which was a 10 minute walk away. During this time we were in contact with Jump 07 who acted as a lookout. Between 1545 and 1630 we made several attemps to retrieve the reamaining cargo in.

Three major safety issues. 1) there is no suppression agreement between NM & CO. our assignment was NM; we could not cross state line into CO to fight this fire saafely and logically. Dozer line stopped at state line with no anchor to tie to. Two organizations doing suppression on both sides of almost invisible line. NM had adequate resources. In CO, jurisdiction is county sheriff in a very large county, sparse population, limited funds that result in relying on mutal aid and volunteers lacking in experience and quals. This is evident on 29th with safety issue #2. We had planned to burn out on NM side but scratched operation do to high gust winds up to 40-50 mph coming off mesa rim. we limited use of helicopter as winds increased mid day. CO resources had finally got resouces to NE corner of fire (rough terrain, limited access) with type 2 crew, dozer,3 type 6 engines. Objective was to build line with dozer and hand crew to tie in at state line. At about 1300 at peak burning period N OPS started burnout opertion without notificcation along uncompleted line. We noticed the increased fire behavior and our lookout alerted us to what looked like a burn out along dozer line. As soon as burnout reached corner jog in dozer line, burnout aligned with wind and blewout (fire went from 100 acres to over 2000 in couple hrs) momentarily trapping several firefighters. 3 suffered burns as they moved uphill on dozer line to safety zone. N OPS had all CO resouces go to safe zone. Injuries were tended to by parmedic on CO resouces and reported as minor. Then N OPS started requesting 3 heavies for airdrops. When N OPS was finally informed by someone that winds were to high to safely fly, N OPS started requesting type 1 helio. We had have diffulty finding enough water  for bucket drops. With all resouces sitting in safey zone, it did not seem logical to use these expensive resouces even if they would have been readilly available. After N OPS request for air support was turned down, N OPS requested need for helio to medevac he 3 burn injuries. We were able to make successful evac in high gusty wind conditions. In discussion later we Notd that safety zone was only about 1/3 mile from CO spike camp, and vehicles that had been secured by dozer. Within few minutes of completing evac, N OPS had all CO resouces leave safety zone to spike camp,break it down and leave fire. In hindsight, better Risk Assessment by N OPS would have opted for ground evac and not expose helio, crew, and burn victims to a air evac, so safety issue #3.

On 30th, we had conditions more favorable for burnout and we did our burnout on NM side. same fellow who had been N OPS day before (he had been replaced by more experienced OPS) was acting as DIVS for same area got on our tac and informed us that we did not know what we were doing using unethical language.

The SOFR confronted the crew supervisor after morning briefing and was told they were good to go.

5/22/2011 SOFR observed another crewmember with fiber tape wrapped around the instep and heels of both boots. At the end of shift the Crew Supervisor was asked to bring all crewmembers forward who had tape around their boots. The SOFR inspected all 3 individuals and found the outside stitching seperated on the first boots. The second pair had a hole in the tongue near the toe box. The third pair had seperation of the entire front and heel of both boots. All 3 pairs of boots had excessive wear. The boots started to fall apart at the Horseshoe 2 incident in NM according to the crewmembers. The Crew was involved in direct suppression and mop-up operations upon arrival to this incident. The fire produced extreme behavior burning in salt cedar, arrow weed and brush in and around the Colorado River bottom which was sandy and decadent ground fuels present.

Concerns: Crewmembers allowed to work on the fireline with inadequate footware.

Potential Issues: With the soles of the one pair of boots ready to drop off would have resulted in possible blisters on the bottom of both feet if the firefighter had stepped in hot material and/or impalment by a sharp foregin object amoung the ground debris.

Safety Issue: Crew supervisors need to ensure their firefighters have adequate and proper footwear at all times. The crew could have stopped and bought new boots while traveling from NM to this incident in AZ and/or arrangements could have been made to send them into town to purchase new boots as well. The bottom line is 'accidents are preventable' all firefighters know this and should speak up and say something instead of remaining silent. The Crew was demobbed on 5/22/2011.","The SOFR inspected the 3 individuals boots and determined the one pair needed to be replaced as soon as possible. A photo was taken of the boots and the crew supervisor has told that individual would not be allowed on the fireline due to inagequate footwear. It was also stressed with the 3 firefighters and crew overhead that it could have resulted in injuries and loss time if something happened.

All 3 did say they would buy new boots once they arrived back home.

When Dispatch pulled the copy of Rx Plan, it was noticed the 2011 frequencies were incorrecly identified as well as outdated contact information. I contacted the identified RXB2 to notify him of the incorrect frequencies and asked if there would be an amendment completed. He stated that he would send an IAP the afternoon of 5/04 or 5/05 to supplement the Rx plan with the correct frequencies, locations and an organization chart. 

The burn was planned and postponed several successive days due to weather or other factors.  Requests for an updated IAP to be sent to Dispatch occured each planned ignition day bringing the proposed date of ignition to 5/13/11  As of 165 on 5/12/11 no IAP had been received and Dispatch again left a message with the RXB2 requesting an updated IAP.

RXB2 stated they would try to burn the Anderson unit on 5/13 for 503 acres. He would send over the IAP and Rx Notification report to CRC thru the dispatch email, craig.dispatch@yahoo.com. 

ON 5/13/11 @ 0709 -  Dispatcher goes in service for CRC and checked dispatch email account and found no IAP or Rx Notification report. At 0746 received a call from RTF resources (dispatched through CRC) stating that they were enroute to help with the Rx on the Arapahoe (without resource orders) and were unsure what positions they would be filling when they arrived. I asked them to please call CRC when on scene to let us know their positions so CRC could fill them on resource orders. At 0752, CRC Dispatcher left another message for RXB2 still needing IAP and notification report and stated the CRC was not aware of RTF resources assisting with the Rx. At 0900 CRC Dispatcher received a call from RXB2 stating that he would resend the notification report and confirmed the dispatch email account. At 0904 CRC Dispatcher received a radio call from another RTF resource stating he was enroute to assist with the Rx and was not sure what position he would be filling.

That morning, I met with the Medical Unit Leader, Ground Support and Finance to arrange transport and pay for the medical expenses. The Medical Unit Leader and I also had the opportunity to discuss the absence of agency or incident personnel to help the crewmember. The need for a representative to escort sick or injured firefighters was emphasized and agreed upon in the future.

It should be the expectation that employees have an agency representative or local point of contact until they are either admitted for treatment or released from an emergency room to facilitate follow-up care and to maintain accountability for our employees.

I informed the FMO prior to the 21st day of their assignment that this decision was not in compliance with Assignment Extension guidance in the Mob Guide (page 20-7), the Interagency Incident Business Management Handbook (Ch 12.7-2, pages 24 and 24), and the Interagency Standards for Fire and Fire Aviation Operations (page 07-04). The Interagency Incident Business Management Handbook states that for extensions of single resource/kind extensions (Ch 12.7-2 page 24): 'The Section Chief or Incident Commander will identify the need for assignment extension and will obtain the affected resource’s concurrence. The Section Chief and affected resource will acquire and document the home unit supervisor’s approval.' In addition, at the time the assignment extension was informally agreed upon, R-3 was beginning to initiate a no extension policy for safety reasons.  Beyond the fact that the CRWB and the FMO agreed that the crew could remain assigned to the Incident for 23 days with one Admin Day, without documented justification, they agreed that the Crew's travel day home would not count as being in pay status.

More than the violation of important work/rest safety guidance, is the issue of avoidance when an important issue has been identified.

Actions by STEN violated state forestry policy and safety guidelines. After incident turned out to be false alarm, STEN directed strike team to turn around on busy 4 lane highway rather than at nearby intersection. In the process of the U-turn the water tender went off the road onto the shoulder and almost overturned. STEN actions were patently unsafe and a violation of state policy.

At 14:00 on May 13, 2011 my crew was on standby at the Lovington fire department with a state forestry RMP strike team. A task force member ran in said we had a call. We proceed to the engines and drove off without any briefing and struggling to keep up. The strike team arrived at a hospital ribbon-cutting ceremony. We had not been briefed and thought we were enroute to a fire.

At or around 17:00 we responded to another fire. The STEN was in the last vehicle and directed the strike team to “pick it up” over the radio. The strike team was driving well in excess of the speed limit through the town of Lovington toward Hobbs. About 5 minutes outside of Hobbs, the team was held up because the fire was a false alarm. The STEN then directed the team to perform a u-turn on the 4 lane highway. The lead engine (E-42) responded that they we not supposed to do that. The STEN then blocked traffic with overhead lights on. In the process of the strike performing a u-turn, with heavy traffic, on the highway the water tender almost tipped over.

The tender came around the u-turn fast enough to cause driver side rear tires to come off the ground as the tender turned. The tender was close to tipping over. My engine was behind him and we had an unobstructed view of the turn. The strike team then proceeded back to Lovington.","On May 14 my engine returned and I reported the incident to the FMO.

We were driving down a FS road and the cable that holds and lowers the spare broke, causing the bracket to fall on the road. We performed a modification last year, installing a secondary safety chain system to hold the tire in place in the event that this happened. Fortunateley the chains successfully held the tire in place.

This could have had near catastrophic consequences if we would have been driving on the highway with a passenger car or motorcyle behind us. The bracket alone could have caused damage, and even worse if the whole tire was to fall off. The chains successfully averted this.

Here are pictures of the broken cable, which is somewhat of a thin guage in my opinion for holding the heavy weight of the tire.","The chain system was already in place, all we did last year was tighten it up to hold it tightly in place in the event the cable broke.

We also threaded the chains through a piece of fire hose to avoid rubbing and damaging the spare.    Luckily we chose to put extra support under the spare tire last season upon getting the new crew carriers, knowing that the cable that was originally installed under the spare tire was thin and a weak gauge. If we had not added the extra support to hold the spare tire up, in the event that the cable broke which actually happened this could have caused a huge accident with innocent drivers or even our other crew vehicles.

The corrective actions were that we recognized a poor manufacture design, and added extra support ourselves.

We took our crew carrier to a nearby International dealer and had a new stronger/thicker gauge cable installed. As well as leaving our extra support chains on that we had decided was needed incase of this situation occurring.","05/26/2011 00:00"

The atv was equipped with an atv mounted ignition device and was being used to complete final ignition within the unit. The FIRB atv operator is a current carded ATVO and is a well experienced FIRB with many hours of fire experience operating this type of firing equipment on high, moderate, and low complexity RX burns.

The FIRB (on the ATV) was finishing out interior ignition within the burn unit and was moving along the southern portion of a water slough (water source) at a slow speed due to rough terrain (pocket gopher mounds). It is protocol, during these types of atv interior ignition activities, that the FIRB calls out the current locations of the interior firing to the Rx Burn Boss due to safety considerations within the burn unit. The FIRB was reporting, during the entire interior ignition activities, to the RXB2 and reporting the location of the firing operations as it occurred with the atv mounted firing device.

The ATV front left wheel ran over a large pocket gopher mound and slowly tipped over on its right side. The FIRB was able to step off the atv when it tipped over and no injuries were sustained due to incident. However the atv mounted firing device continued to run and the FIRB shut off the device immediately. The resulting backing fire behind the atv (the atv was now on its right side and immobile) became the main concern and protection of the equipment the first priority.

The FIRB called the RXB2 for assistance (on the radio) and reported the location of the atv incident. The FIRB continued to protect the atv from the backing fire by surpressing the low intensity flames in grass fuels (FM 1) by utilizing the water from the slough and the 15 gallon water tank mounted on the front of the atv. The RXB2 and two other firefighters responded and the atv was uprighted and moved to a safe burned out area in the burn unit.

After a quick inspection of the atv, no damage had occurred to the vehicle. On the 15 gallon water tank located on the front of the atv the spray wand was damaged due to the atv rolling on its side. The atv started after uprighting and no repairs were needed except for the replacement of the spray wand.","#1 Issue: Due to the manner that the atv was equipped with a 15 gallon water tank on the front rack.....it became apparent that during low visibility conditions (e.g. after dark) that glare from the top front light of the atv into the water tank was a contributing factor for this incident. This glare of light resulted in the lack of visibility for the FIRB/ATVO while operating the atv. Therefore the operator was not aware of the location of the large pocket gopher mound that caused the atv to tip over on its right side.

Mitigation: Turn off or blacken out the top front light on the atv which causes the glare and visibility problems for the atv operator. The two front head lights on the atv is more than enough light to still safely operate the atv. Turning off this front top light will require an atv mechanic to perform since manual shut off from the ATVO is not possible on this vehicle.

#2 Issue: The 15 gallon water tank spray wand was damaged and broken when the atv tipped over on its right side. This resulted in limited use of the spray wand (using water) to suppress and protect the atv from flame impingement of the backing fire.

Mitigation: Installing a spray wand holder (e.g. hollow pvc pipe located on front fender of the atv) would enhance protection of the spray wand so that it won`t be damaged during this type of incident.","05/24/2011 00:00"

The walls were composed of three stacked, 8' x 8' treated lumber boards that were recessed in a raised gravel berm that in turn was covered with an organic mat for erosion control. The grass thatch on this particular target berm was burned during the previous shift (Saturday, 4/30). After quickly burning off the thatch, a smoldering fire became established in the underlying, desiccated peat mat but remained undetected. Overnight, fire spread from the organic mat to the treated lumber walls. The walls burned close enough to several electronic panels to damage them and melt through several wires that went into the ground and were connected to the wider area electric grid.

The Burn Boss (RXB2) discovered the damage to the military target at approximately 1430 on Sunday, 5/1. At that time, he communicated the situation up the chain to Alaska Fire Service (AFS) Military Zone Fire Management and contacted DTA Range Control to address the possibility of electrical fire in the buried wires. AFS personnel are not trained in electrical fire suppression, so the RXB2 did not take action beyond communicating the potentially ongoing problem and keeping his subordinates away from the area. The Military Zone Duty Officer contacted the Fort Greely Fire Department to respond to the possible electrical fire.

An engine from FGFD arrived at approximately 1645 and was escorted to the scene by AFS personnel. By that time, Range Control had made several attempts to contact Doyon Utilities, LLC, the corporation that maintains the electrical grid in this remote part of the DTA, to have the power to the damaged target shut off if necessary. Range Control left messages after being unable to make direct contact with a representative of Doyon at the established emergency phone number. At approximately 1715, FGFD Dispatch made contact with a Doyon representative who stated that the electrical grid in question was not maintained by Doyon. Fortunately, the Range Control employee on scene confidently knew otherwise, overheard the conversation between the FGFD on-scene chief and FGFD Dispatch, and corrected the mistake before response was further delayed. A Doyon employee arrived on scene at approximately 1745 to verify that the damaged military target electronics had successfully tripped a circuit breaker and did not pose an immediate threat to emergency responders, who by that time had extinguished the fire.

Given the three-hour lag between the AFS employee’s identification of a possible electrical fire and the Doyon employee’s arrival on scene to verify whether or not and how power would be shut off to the damaged target, there remains a need to identify possible shortcomings in the emergency contact protocols for Doyon Utilities in the Donnelly Training Area East.","We ensured that DTA Range Control, the FGFD, and Doyon Utilities ultimately coordinated with each other to prevent the damaged target wiring from posing a continued risk to workers in the area or to the buried wires and associated electrical grid.","05/21/2011 00:00"

As expected, communications with Dispatch on the Shingle Fire were severely limited as a result of Rat Lake being non-functional. On the truck mounted mobile radios I was able to utilize Long Lake repeater to reach Dispatch, however on a portable I was unable to hit either adjacent repeater (Long Lake or Archibald) and was unable to communicate with Dispatch. Cell phone communication at the fire location was hit or miss and is not a reliable substitute for adequate radio coverage. Prior to the loss of Rat Lake repeater this location had excellent portable radio coverage and was easily within range.","In this particular situation the lack of communication with Dispatch via portable radio was mitigated by simply hiking back a short distance to the road where the truck was parked and using the mobile radio. However, on a larger and/or more complex incident this solution would’ve likely been inadequate.

CIO is aware of our Rat Lake repeater issue and is working on a solution, however this incident clearly illustrates the need for a temporary or replacement repeater to be established as soon as possible.","04/25/2011 00:00"

The TFLD then decided he was uncomfortable remaining in this location as the flame front approached and made the decision to move his units to a different location further from the flame front into an different safety zone. As these units left the area, the T2IA crew working under direct supervision of the DIVS made the decision to stay in the original safety zone near the structures in a stay and defend action. This decision was made between the CRWB, DIVS, and squad bosses. As the task force and strike team were leaving the safety zone, the safety officer approached a squad boss and the CRWB and advised them to leave the area and proceed to the safety zone with the other resourced that had just left the area. The crew abided by this order and loaded up their equipment and began to move towards the new safety zone. As this was occurring, fire behavior was extreme and was working towards the escape route all of the resources were using. When the strike team, task force, and crew arrived at a road junction, movement stopped and vehicles bottle necked. At this point, the fire was moving directly towards the resources as they were now directly in front of the head of the fire. The fire proceeded to move towards the resources as they were still stopped. The fire quickly crested a ridge and covered the gound between the stopped resources and the flame front. The fire was burning in a continous area of 3' tall grass. Resources began to move very quickly as visbility decreased. The units in the back of the line of apparatus were forced to wait until the line moved. The fire came very close to burning over the line of vehicles. Units were able to escape the burnover prior to it occurring but had to do so in a shower of embers and low visibilty and heat. This escape route could have easily been cut off and resources would have been trapped due to the number of apparatus and narrow farm roads in the area.","","04/14/2011 00:00"

Instructions were to prepare assigned structures for fire before it moved into the area. Our resource was assigned to a large ranch site which sat on about 10-12 acres. The area was flat and well maintained prior to crews arrival and with grazed cattle areas around the east and south sides with drainage areas with less fuels on the west. Site was sitting on the north flank of the fire and was determined to more than likely be hit with flanking fire rather than major head of the fire.

Based on the site size and expected flame lengths of 10 to 20', this site was deemed an appropriate sized safety zone for prepare and defend tactics if so instructed. This plan was proposed to the DIVS twice and concurred. According to the IRPG, this site would be a sufficiently sized safety zone for flame lengths of 50 to 75'.

The site was prepped by the type 2 IA crew including fuel reduction, and structure preparation. The structure protection plan was implemented. Several dozer transports and a task force of federal engines and strike team of Texas type 6 engines were also pulled into the site.

Later as the flame front approached, the safety officer who arrived at the site stated he didn't want any resources to stay at the site and instructed the DIVS to send the resources out down a two lane dirt road to a highway to the east about 1 mile away. This was a pre-identified escape route. However, our resource felt this was now unsafe as the route led out to the front of the head of the fire (later we learned the fire ran 15 miles in a day with a 5 mile front). It was stated we preferred to stay at the site and let the flame front pass. The safety officer again instructed all resources to leave. As the engines and overhead departed, the type 2 IA crew was left trying to quickly pack up all tools and personnel onto crew buggies. They were delayed approximately 5 to 10 minutes due to the length of time to load.

All resources then ran into a traffic jam at the head of the fire, as a small 'T' intersection became jammed with volunteer fire apparatus which were in the area unknown to our division, and heavy equipment ahead of the engines and crew all trying to negotiate the turn to depart the area.

The task force of engines was stopped, the type 2 IA crew then came into line at the back of the group awaiting opening of the intersection. At that time, a lookout noted and transmitted that the head of the fire had topped out on the flats and began to move towards the resources at the traffic jam. A call was made over the radio to the DIVS of the approaching flame front and the need to get vehicles moving. A federal engine captain then transmitted that the resources needed to move 'immediately'. As the head of the fire approached, the resources were able to move and head out to the identified safety zone. All federal resources made the safety zone with no problem and there were no injuries or damages. The division resources were never re-engaged the rest of the operational period during the blow up.

Concerns:

1. Why did we leave designated safety zones to the head of the fire to go to another safety zone?

2. Trust your own best judgement. If necessary, refuse to leave the safety zone for another area. By leaving, you put your resource(s) in possible danger.

3. It was stated many times our objective was to assist Texas State and the volunteers, but working in our own system separate of the volunteers. As federal resources, why do we allow them to 'run the show'? We then allow poor communications, separate command teams, poor tactics, loss of control of forces, span of control compromised or non-existent, etc. All are watchout situations. Do agency administrators and incident commanders at the assignment areas assume liability by allowing so many normal procedures to be brken or ignored?

4. There were never enough resources on this fire. Later, the IC declared there was a 'Division Ops' who was the operations chief for this incident as this fire was considered a 'division' of West Texas IA. Concern about making up ICS positions.

5. We never had a map during the firs few days of the incident.

6. After being pulled off the fire, all resources staged and were never re-engaged that day as structures we lost.","Expressed preference and plan to stay at site.

Unable to get stopped, E-2811 continued down the drivers side of WT-2844 with less than a foot of clearance between the two vehicles, pinning me to the drivers side door, barely missing me.

Our engine is based out of Bernalillo, New Mexico. We were dispatched out of Bernalillo to a fire that was burning along the river in Chimayo. The fire was located in Santa Fe County. Upon arrival at the fire, I was able to make contact with the IC and get a briefing. After clarifying that LCES was in place I asked the IC what he would like our engine to do. He told me at that time that there was some saw work needing a C-faller and that later on, he would like to turn the fire over to me and that I should tie in with the firefighter who was running operations, and that Ops could give me a better operational briefing.

I started to walk the fire with Ops and we talked about what I would like to see done before I felt comfortable taking over the fire as IC4. Some of the local firefighters were having trouble with some large cottonwood snags that were on fire. As it was starting to get dark, both Ops and I agreed that getting burning snags on the ground was important to do before it was completely dark. I also wanted to locate 2 spot fires that the IC had told me about. As well, I wanted to walk the line before it got dark. I needed to create a good picture for myself of what type of fire I was dealing with, before it became dark and I was in unfamiliar terrain.

At this point, I asked my b-faller to prepare the saw and take a look at the trees that were on fire while I continued my walk around and talked tactics with Ops. It was obvious at this time that although the local resources were doiong a good job of getting line around the fire and generally getting a hand on the fire, they had minimal wildland experience and they were eager for me to tell them that what they were doing was adequate.

At this point, Ops and I had tied in with the b-faller and my other crew member and we started to size up 3 or 4 trees that were still on fire and appeared to be a containment issue. At this point, after recognizing that these were C level trees, I asked the faller if he was comfortable dropping them. He said he was comfortable. I let him know that they were C-trees and that I would have to supervise him put the trees on the ground.

I needed to continue working with Ops before we lost all light, and at this point Ops was having a hard time verbalizing to me exactly where the spot fires were located. I also needed to know what type of pumps and hose we had running. The idea being that we would get some water on the downed snags before the local resources were released and took their pumps and hose with them.

I could not create a plan with Ops and drop the C trees at the same time. I needed to find some way to mitigate this problem. In order to keep my crew safe and not have people doing jobs that they are not red carded to do, I decided to do the following: I would supervise the faller to drop the snags, while at the same time continue to work with Ops on a plan that would allow us to finish up with water and start releasing local resources. The locals had voiced their opinion that they felt uncomfortable working under the cottonwoods at night. I was able to accomplish my objectives, keep within IWCG guidelines, keep all resources safe, and not have my crew members work in positions they were not qualified for. Had I run the saw, I would not have been able to accomplish all that I wished. When the IC signed our CTRs, I asked him to make a note that the faller and I had both worked as fallers. He was more than happy to do this. I had also asked him to fill out a State Fire report.

After I had turned in our CTRs and Fire Report in Bernalillo, I received 3 calls from my fire manager to my cell phone. The first call was pleasant and he asked me about our times and why the faller and I had both worked as fallers. I explained what had happened, and told him that there was documentation on the CTRs. He told me, 'That will work.' Later he called again, wanting to let me know that in the future I needed to be running the saw and he didn't want anyone to be a faller trainee, that was 'not how the State ran things.' Approximately a week after the second call, I was called a third time and told that our times had been changed and there was no way I could physically not have a saw in hand and be a C-faller.

The problem that I really have is a safety issue. Decisions that were made and documented in the field by the IC, OPs and I are being second-guessed and changed for financial reasons. I receive a higher pay rate as a C-faller than I do as an incident commander or engine boss. Safety in the field cannot be compromised for political expediency. If changes were to be made, those changes would need to be initiated by the IC, the commander in the field. This chain of command is explained in detail to all firefighters in S-130, S-190. State Forestry cannot direct field operations from 10 miles away, 10 days later.

By changing job titles in an effort to cut costs, I am forced to have asked my workers to fill positions not on their red cards, as well as generally not having control of my resources. This is poor, unsafe firefighting and I don't want to be part of an unsafe act.","","05/06/2011 00:00"

This incident occured within the southeast zone 2 fire management unit, Doniphan/Eleven Point district of the Mark twain NF. I was able to relay information through a human repeater placed in a local fire tower, but this was only sporadic at best, and is not normal procedure. Good communications were established on the incident tactical channels to maintain safety mitigation measures. The two local repeaters are High Hill and Sinking Creek,in which one of them was only 10 miles away from the incident. I was able at one point to access the Williamsville repeater which was more than 50 miles away from the incident, but from a location that was not in proximity to the primary operations area of the fire.Once I moved from this location I was unable to access any of the repeaters clearly enough to transmit information. At the time of this incident, many fires were occuring throughout Missouri , with all state and federal agencies engaged in fire suppresion.Relative humidities were in the lower teens and winds were sustained from 20 to 28 mph, with gusts to 40 mph. The Pine fire had immediate structures threatened upon my arrival at the scene, and thus became the priority. Communications from the forest dispatch to other resources while driving to this fire was un-readable and very garbled. Also, there was no or limited cell phone service on this incident. I feel that if an incident within an incident had happened on this fire the outcome may have been negative. The local VFDs had very poor communications adding to the complexity and overall safety factor.

I feel in no way should we assume that this can somehow grow to be the expected way of conducting Initial Attack fire communications, or during related projects conducted on the forest. This has been, and is, an on-going issue here on the forest and is a topic of every fire refresher, leadership team meeting, after action review, and coffee table discussions. There have been many tickets generated about this problem, and through the effort that has been made, the problem has not been resolved.This is the case not only within this zone, but throughout the entire Mark Twain forest.This is simply not acceptable, not what we teach, or have been instructed throughout our careers in resource management, especially relating to wildfire response. This was also not 'one of those days that the radios had a mind of their own' type of situation. I am writing this for the lives it may save if this issue is addressed at the level it should be. Submitting another ticket is not the answer.Thank You!

The duty officer dispatched an Engine  (T6) with 2 Firefighters + 4 additional Firefighters. Upon leaving the Wilderness Station, these resources attempted communication with dispatch to go 'enroute to fire', but were unable to make that communication. While enroute and once on scene, communications were never established with Silver City Dispatch. During this time and for the duration of the incident the Duty Officer was in radio contact with responding resources via a line of sight frequency and by using the Mimbres repeater which only covers aproximately a 15 mile radius of the Mimbres River Canyon. The Duty Officer was also in contact with Silver City Dispatch via land line and acted as relay between the fire and dispatch. The dispatcher on duty has stated that she first alerted the Wilderness District by phone because she was aware of the radio problems and that the Signal Peak repeater was not operating correctly, which had been the case for at least a couple of days.

Is it not one of the duties as an Engineer to drive the engine especially to a fire? If it still is then why do we still have Captains

driving engines to fires, especially I.A. In an engine that is a standard transmission, and the Captain is on the phone, taking

on the radio while trying to shift gears.

Does this not warrant safety issues, of a distracted driver? Is it not the duties of the Captain to be in the captain’s seat,

talking to disp, and other resources while en route etc; While his Engineer drives and pays attention to the road to get the

crew to the fire or where ever safely.

I witness this time and time again year after year, when I did ask why; I was told by a Captain “I don’t like anybody driving

but me.” Though not every engine crew does this, but yet I have and still see engine crews do this. If engine crews have a

fully qualified Engineer there should be NO reason why safety risks are still occurring.","","02/17/2011 00:00"

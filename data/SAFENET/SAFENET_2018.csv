OVCC's ability to use the radio has been consistently non-functional in the morning hours and the functionality returns intermittently in the early afternoon.  Due to the lack of consistent communication, the Inyo National Forest Service Law Enforcement Captain has made the decision to pull his LEO's from the field.  The Bishop BLM Field Staff L.E Ranger has made the decision not to go into the field unless there is radio communication with OVCC.  This outage has significantly effected OVCC's ability to safely serve its field going resources.  The ongoing Government Shutdown paired with the lack of consistent communication is setting up the Inyo National Forest and Bishop BLM for a serious safety problem if/when a Fire/Natural Disaster or significant Law Enforcement event were to occur.","The outage was reported to the Inyo National Forest Radio Technician (who is currently furloughed due to the ongoing Government Shutdown) along with Forest Service Management and Law Enforcement.

At this time BV SWIFT will no longer be available as a Crew for Fires.  Rifle and Canon will continue to be available for Resource Orders as a Crew for Fires but will only pull 15 Offenders.  It will now require 3 Crew Bosses to deploy to a Fire.  In the event that Rifle or Canon receive a RO each will report to the Incident the evening of the first operational period and will provide supervision of the Offenders while in camp for the duration of the Incident.  The Crews original Crew Bosses will assume responsibility for Offender supervision after the morning briefing and will be responsible for supervision until returning to camp.  Upon returning to camp the Crew Boss from BV will assume responsibility for supervision.  This would mean that the two Crew Bosses from the original facility of the Crew will be On Duty at the start of the Morning Briefing through the Operational period and will go Off Duty upon returning the Offenders to Camp.  The evening supervision Crew Bosses will go On Duty when the Offenders return to camp and go Off Duty when the Crew Bosses return from Morning Briefing.  All Off Duty Crew Bosses are expected to be Off Duty and not performing any Duty Tasks.  The camp supervision is expected to be alert at all times'. <br/><br/><br/>The main safety concern is that if the SWIFT crews, by this new internal policy,  are only allowed to only 'Pull 15 offenders' then the total crew number (with two CRWB) is 17, not the 18-20 crew members required by NWCG standards. From the CRWB perspective it takes 20 committed team members to accomplish the tasks assigned on wildland fire. I have personally worked the fireline with the minimum of 18 members and the loss of personnel was very noticeable. I feel that the loss of 3 crew members will reduce our effectiveness, work capacity and manpower, putting the entire team in unnecessary danger","No actions taken.<br/><br/>I feel it is my responsibility to bring this attempted violation of NWGC policy to the attention of personnel outside of the Colorado Dept of Corrections; with the hope that this policy will be reviewed and if needed challenged.","10/16/2018 11:08"

Bald Mountain had been combined with the Pole Creek Fire (UT-UWF-000971) and both incidents were under the command of IMT X Team #X, Incident Commander XXXXX <br/><br/>Travel on 17/18 Sept from Clark, WY to Payson, UT was 547 miles.  No one in Finance would sign a travel shift ticket (OF-297), so ENGB XXXX submitted the shift ticket to Ops Chief-planning (t) XXXXX for signature. The shift ticket showed Demob/Travel on 10/2 and Travel on 10/3. <br/><br/>Ops approved both days, as 547 miles divided by 45 mph average is 12.2 hours (VIPR contract Section D.6.5.2) of drive time and a driver is limited to a maximum of 10 hours of drive time per day. (VIPR Contract Section D.6.6, Section D.21.8.1.2 (a) and (b); Interagency Business Management Handbook (4/18 edition) chapter 10 page 10-14 lines 1-3; CFR 49.B.III part 395.3 and 395.5.)<br/><br/>When the shift ticket was presented at Finance it was initially accepted until it reached XXXXX (she did not give her position title, but it appeared she was a supervisor).  XXXXX refused to accept the shift ticket for two days of travel because her calculation from Spanish Fork, UT to Clark, WY was 507 miles or 11.3 hours of drive time and she will not pay for two days of travel.  XXXXX claimed that her interpretation of VIPR contract Section D.3.1 (3) requires ALL personnel on an Engine to have a CDL and be capable of driving the Engine.<br/><br/>ENGB XXXXX left finance and came and got me.  I am the driver/operator of the Engine, ENGB, and owner/president of the company.  <br/><br/>Upon entering the Finance yurt I encountered several individuals we had worked with that informed me that my employee and company had been the topic of conversation between the time ENGB XXXXX left and returned with me.  XXXXX had made it clear to everyone that she was not paying two days travel for 500 miles.<br/><br/>When I approached XXXXX she produced a copy of page 37 of my VIPR agreement including the following section:<br/><br/>“D.3.1 -- TRAINING/EXPERIENCE.<br/>.<br/>(a) Each person employed by the Contractor under this Agreement shall meet the following minimum requirements, and be able to provide evidence that employees meet the requirements upon request:<br/>(1) RT-130 Annual Fireline Refresher including fire shelter<br/>(2) All Tactical Water Tender and Engine personnel shall be trained in accordance with NWCG Wildland Fire Qualifications System Guide PMS 310-1 and qualifications carded in accordance with Exhibit N and Exhibit O, Training and Positions Qualifications Requirements. This does not apply to Support Water Tender personnel.<br/>(3) Commercial Drivers License, when required.<br/>(4) All operators shall be able to operate the equipment safely up to the manufacturers limitations.”  (Bold language was highlighted on her copy)<br/><br/>XXXXX claimed that her interpretation was that all personnel on the Engine must have a Commercial Drivers License (CDL) because “what if the driver got hurt, who would drive the truck?”<br/><br/>After a discussion, I stated that in twelve years we have never been required to have everyone on the Engine have a CDL.  No where in the VIPR agreement, Interagency Handbook, or NWCG 310 does it require a CDL for everyone on an Engine.  Finance XXXXX was asked to show the requirement for everyone to have a CDL.  She could only reference D.3.1 (3), omitting the phrase “when required”.<br/><br/>When I showed her VIPR Contract Section D.6.5.2 -- The Government will estimate the travel time to and from the incident. Travel time via ground transportation shall be calculated by dividing distance (from point of hire to incident, or incident to incident or incident to point of hire) by average travel speed of 45 mph, plus applicable rest time. And D.21.8.1.2 -- Driver Hour Limitation - The following Driver Hour limitations, as referenced at D.6.6, shall apply to this agreement:<br/>(a) No driver will drive more than 10 hours (behind the wheel/actual driving time) within any dutyday (operational period, see Exhibit A).<br/><br/>XXXXX stated that she was not paying a crew just to drive 450 miles in a day.  She stated that we are only 507 miles from home and can easily drive that in a day.  That is why she said that everyone is required to have a CDL so that after the first driver drives 10 hours the second one can drive 10 hours and so on.<br/><br/>I informed her that even if everyone on the truck had a CDL the most they could drive would be 14 hours and then everyone would have to have 10 hours off under CFR 49.<br/><br/>XXXXX stated that there was a Contracting Officer present and brought XXXXX (PROC) into the discussion.  XXXXX immediately agreed with XXXXX that all personnel on an Engine need to have a CDL and be able to drive the truck.<br/><br/>XXXXX then had XXXXX email my Regional Contracting Officer, XXXXX to see if she was available.  XXXXX then called and put XXXXX on speaker phone.  XXXXX then read “D.3.1 <br/>(a) Each person employed by the Contractor under this Agreement shall meet the following minimum requirements,<br/>(3) Commercial Drivers License.”<br/><br/>XXXXX agreed that required everyone on the Engine to have a CDL.  <br/><br/>I made myself known to XXXXX that I was hearing the call (XXXXX then advised her that we were on speaker phone) and that we have never had to have everyone on the Engine able to drive, to do so now would constitute a material change in the contract.<br/><br/>XXXXX then accused me of arguing with them so that they would have to pay for a second day.  She stated that since we had been on the clock since 0700 and it was now almost 0900 and we have 11.3 hours of driving we are at 13.3 hours of work, so we are trying to delay and argue until we have more than 14 hours.<br/><br/>At that time I said I would sign the invoice in protest and dispute it later.  <br/><br/>I then signed the invoice, cleared through Demob, and we left.<br/><br/>All of this took place very publically and loudly so that every person, engine, or crew that was out processing at that time was made aware that XXXXX, XXXXX, and later XXXXX felt that driving for only 10 hours or 450 miles (after working a 13 day assignment) was not enough.  <br/><br/>XXXXX and XXXXX passion in arguing that only driving 10 hours is unacceptable to them indicated that this is not the first time they have based decisions of personal basis.<br/><br/>Instead of following the requirements of the VIPR contracts, Interagency Business Handbook, and Code of Federal Regulation they use coercion, intimidation, public shaming, defamation, and withholding of approved funds to push their personal agendas. <br/><br/>It does no good for the Incident Commander, Ops Chief, and team Safety to preach safety, especially when traveling home if the last people that departing resources encounter demand that they travel longer, faster, and with fewer breaks to save a few dollars.<br/><br/>The willful violation of travel rules and regulations by these individuals jeopardizes the health and safety of everyone and can lead to injury or death of firefighters and the general public.","I took personal action to follow the travel time and broke it up into two days, regardless of pay. <br/><br/>I recommend that all personnel involved in finance and demob on any incident receive training on the travel time requirement of VIPR contracts, Interagency Business Handbook, and Code of Federal Regulation.<br/><br/>I recommend a review of all post demob accidents (especially those involving injury or death) to see if any contact or actions of those involved in this incident played a part.","10/16/2018 13:26"

These contractors traveled hundreds of miles each day on Forest Service roads delivering personnel and supplies to Drop Points, Helibases, Staging Areas, etc.  They were originally allowed to check out command radios.  They were instructed in the use of command radios so that they could communicate with divisions.  Communication by radio with divisions is necessary so that Ground Support drivers can interface with operations and operational ground traffic in way of avoiding potential accidents and mishaps with other operational ground traffic.<br/><br/>On or about 9/19/18, the logistics section chief (LSC) with told the aforementioned 11 Ground Support Drivers that they were to 'return all command radios to the Communication Unit because Boise wanted the radios back'.  The Ground Support Unit Leader explained to the LSC that the use of command radios by Ground Support drivers is an essential safety protocol and that the use of command radios by Ground Support allows Ground Support drivers communication with operational ground resources in way of avoiding conflicts, accidents, mishaps and collisions.  <br/><br/>Nevertheless she (the LSC) demanded that the command radios be returned to the Communication Unit, and they were returned according to her instructions.<br/><br/>My feeling is that the need to return the radios to Boise in no way outweighed the need for the radios on the incident.  I feel that the LSC's demand to have the radios removed increased exposure to risk to the Ground Support drivers and to the operational personnel and equipment they encountered after the radios were removed.  I think it was a bad decision, and that decision increased exposure to risk for a number of incident personnel for several operational periods.","Ground support overhead (EQPMs) immediately expressed concerned to the Ground Support Unit Leader (GSUL).  He (the GSUL) expressed concerns to the LSC, but she persisted in demanding that the command radios be turned in by the Ground Support drivers.  I think also that the GSUL brought the concern to the SOFR.<br/><br/>Later in the incident (on or about 9/29/18), in way of trying to mitigate the poor decision made by the LSC, the Ground Support Unit Leader checked out three command radios for use by Ground Support drivers; however, because of the limited number of radios available (three radios for about 11 ground support drivers) there were still instances when Ground Support drivers were required to go to operational destinations without proper means of communicating with operational personnel.","10/01/2018 15:53"

We were traveling from dinner back to the hotel. The restaurant that we eat at is located on a one way street which we had traveled to reach the fire line the previous day as well as the day of the incident. I believe that this was pretty well known the road is a one way street since we had driven down the road numerous times as well as traveling the road to arrive at dinner. The road is divided by a median that has frequent breaks for turning around to go the direction you want to travel. He asked the passenger before they pulled out onto the road if he was clear to turn. The passenger responded yes thinking that the driver was wondering if there was a curb or ditch on the passenger side of the vehicle. The individual driving a state assigned vehicle then pulled out of the parking lot and took a hard left turn which put them traveling the wrong direction on the one way street. There was a vehicle traveling in the correct direction down the street when this took place. The driver did manage to stay mostly onto the shoulder with a small amount of the vehicle being in the lane. This is a two lane road and the vehicle traveling in the correct direction was in the far lane from the shoulder. This did happen when it was dark outside which could have contributed to the driver not seeing the median. I believe that the driver had plenty of rest leading into this incident because the two days we worked this fire we were getting lots of breaks and had an easy assignment. The concern/potential issue with this incident is that it could have easily resulted into a head on collision with the potential for serious injuries. The safety issue I see after watching this incident is when getting thrown onto a engine or hand crew where you are meeting up with other people who you may or may not know and know how many fires they have been on. Then you get into a vehicle with them not knowing how tired someone is as well as any previous driving history the person has. This not only could be putting themselves at risk but the passengers as well.","When we arrived back at the hotel there was a discussion with the driver of the vehicle where the question was asked about being able to see and drive at night with the answer being yes I can see fine at night. The discussion with the individual will hopefully mitigate this from happening again in the future there was not a whole lot to mitigate during the incident itself aside from what the driver did after making the decision to turn the wrong way down a one way road.","09/18/2018 10:24"

We relieved the T3 Team-and attended an in-briefing where we learned that we were the 5th team to take over this complex.<br/><br/>Conversations during mobilization to the incident with the Fire Staff Officer had revealed that the financial package was in complete disarray, and that would likely be the focus of our task during our tenure on the incident, as the fire was large (~50,000 acres), but had relatively remained in its footprint for several days.<br/><br/>My team officially took command of the fire on 9/8/18 at 0600 hrs.  That morning at the 0600 operational briefing, I gave my normal 1st day leader's intent speech regarding zero tolerance for drugs/alcohol/and harassment of any kind, all personnel deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, trash, speeding in camp and local community, and lastly, all folks checked in to the fire will live, work, and sleep here.  Industrial logging traffic was back in swing, and unnecessary exposure on roads in night hours would be eliminated.  Later that evening I spoke with one of the Agency Representatives(AREP), and she said that the DFMO was very much against my request to keep folks in camp overnight, but she stated she would support my decision regardless, and we scheduled a meeting for the next day after my C&G meeting.  The next day I had gone to the spike camp for the 0730 ops briefing to deliver the same message.  <br/>During my absence, the DFMO and AREP approached the IC trainee after the ops briefing at ICP, and attempted to have the conversation regarding fire personnel staying in camp.  The trainee deferred the conversation to myself, and we ended up on a call with the AREP and DFMO at 1110 that morning. <br/><br/>The AREP led the call, as the DFMO whispered to her.  There had been a 180 degree change from the AREP, and she now agreed with the DFMO that the District personnel should be exempt from staying in camp.  I told her I did not feel comfortable with folks driving the winding road system, especially after the district had just briefed us on the dangerous logging haul trucks associated with our main access road system for the fire.  The forest AREP decided they would provide a list of district personnel, we would establish a check-in/check-out procedure for locals, and this would be added to and documented in the “letter of intent” provided by the AA in addition to the Delegation of Authority (DOA).  Accountability and liability for local folks would be held by the District and the NF.  This would serve as the exemption of the IC’s intent for fire personnel to “sleep in camp” for local District employees.   All others would follow the IC’s discretion. <br/><br/>On the morning of 9/12/18 before the 0600 ops briefing, myself and the team safety officer commented on the enormous number of vehicles coming into camp.  I asked the ops group and the entire C&G group to follow up with their folks to ensure only exempt district personnel were traveling to and from the fire.  That evening it was confirmed that as many as 50-60 additional contractors from ICP and spike camp were in fact travelling both ways to and from the fire, and a handful were travelling as much as 2 hours each way, and in the dark.  These actions by both district and contract personnel consequently resulted in individuals showing up either late or minutes before briefing, and eating breakfast after briefing.  This was further seen as a non-cost effective affect to taxpayer dollars, when contractors are paid a daily rate.   On 9/13/18, at the morning ops briefing I once again took the opportunity to clarify that personnel checked-in to the Incident would not drive to and from their residence or hotels, etc., all personnel will overnight in camp.  I also explained that there was a shower and national caterer onsite.  I further shared the news of the dozer operator that rolled his truck and died while driving back to his 0600 briefing just 2 days prior on 9/11/18.<br/><br/>I could tell that the request and the account of driver fatality had little effect on the crowd.  Following the briefing I spoke with the DFMO, and he was very clear to me, that if I planned on demobing folks for driving home, whether contract or not, I had better get on the phone with the AA for approval first.  This did not make sense, as the AA had framed this very clearly in the “DOA/letter of intent” regarding only the District names that were provided would be exempt.  <br/>I expressed my concerns at the C&G later that morning at 1000, and by 1100, I had a text message from the Deputy Forest Supervisor, stating that he would be at camp at 1315 to discuss some issues of “risk management” with myself and my trainee.  I invited my safety officer and my Human Resources specialist as well since the topic was risk management.<br/>  The Deputy Forest Supervisor showed up on time and had the Forest Fire Staff Officer with him.  We began our discussion and it was clearly related once again to fire personnel staying in camp, only this time, we were also talking about all personnel including contractors.  The Deputy insisted many times that we were running a closed camp, and I disagreed many times.  He made it clear that on the NF that they like people to have choice……….  I listened to the Deputy’s reply, and his complaints of the volume of calls he had received in the last 2 days from union representatives as well as firefighters alike.  He insisted that there must be a compromise, and I reminded him that he was not a signature on my DOA.<br/><br/>The Deputy had a phone call he had to take at 1400, so we agreed to table the talks until after his meeting which should be about 1 hour or so.  At about 1730, I began to look for the Deputy so we could continue our conversation and get back to a resolution.  I found the deputy and Fire Staff officer, but the Deputy made it a point that he just wanted to talk with me, even after I said that I wanted to grab the trainee for this experience.  He told me he was not sure, but the local union agreement might also protect his forest personnel from having to stay in camp, and he was going to check on the language and get back to me.  I told him I was doubtful that the language was to be applied to fire camp situations, but more like work center and government housing situations.  <br/>The Deputy and I continued to respectfully disagree on the same topics as before, and he wanted to know what the hard line “no’s” were for me.  I told him, #1) I did not feel comfortable allowing folks the choice to drive home, #2) these same folks might be  meeting 2:1 work/rest on paper, but I was concerned if that was actually happening with drive times, and #3) I cannot uphold my delegation responsibility for a zero-tolerance fire, when I don’t know what sort of after-hours alcohol and drug consumption was taking place. <br/><br/>He seemed to understand my concerns, and asked if I had a recommended solution.  I told him the support of the DOA from the AA would be sufficient, however separating out their own employees in an exemption to start with was to blame for most of the current dissension.  I told him we simply might not be the team for him, as we will not budge on safety issues, especially knowingly putting folks at potential unnecessary risk.  I also shared with him that a few local contractors and 2 District employees alike had spoken with a couple of my Division Group Supervisors the night before, making them aware that the DFMO had started encouraging local employees and contractors alike to call or visit the union rep, the Forest, political constituents and staffers, etc. about us “illegally running a closed camp”. <br/><br/>I asked if he knew what the intent or end state his DFMO was looking for, but he had no answer.  I told him I felt that these actions were now a transference of my accountability and liability of the DOA, to the hands of others without my consent.  He again asked for a solution.  I told him the only way I felt we could get back on track with the current situation that was quickly emerging, was to have the AA- Forest Supervisor come to the morning Ops briefing and stand with me and support our request, and how it was safety and removing unnecessary variables of driving from a potentially fatal and catastrophic outcome.  The deputy agreed, and said he wanted to support us.  He was to bring this to the AA, and we would make a plan to address the fire personnel. <br/><br/>On 9/14/18, I received an early morning text again from the Deputy Forest Supervisor, asking for my email and that he would like to send some thoughts to consider while he drove to camp that morning.  I provided the email, asked what time we should expect him, and let him know I was planning on heading to the local health clinic after our C&G meeting at 1000, as I was getting the camp crud.  He said we could meet later that afternoon, and again said he was going to send a short write up that we could discuss that afternoon.<br/><br/>I returned at approximately 1740, read through the Deputy’s email that was sent at 1141, and texted the Deputy at 1800 to let him know I was back from the Dr.  He was onsite, and we met again in the Command/Ops/Safety office structure at ICP promptly.  I again had the IC trainee, the team safety officer, and the human resources specialist present.  The operations section chief was also in the room, working on resources changes for the following day.  <br/>The deputy asked if I had read his email, which I had.  I responded to the deputy that these were the exact same things we had spoken about the day prior.  He was once again insistent that if all of my concerns could be met, would I be good with folks driving  home.  I again told him that this was a hard line for me, and it was written and signed this way in the Agency Administrator’s DOA and intent.  I reminded him of our one on one conversation the previous day about AA’s support at briefing to show a united front based on safety, with relation to driving home.  He said they could not do that. <br/><br/> My safety officer began to offer a general response related to the external pressures that were at play, (referring to the union’s heavy presence and obvious pressures) and the deputy uncorked an angry reply, saying “you have no idea what it feels like to be in this chair, this region, this forest, and especially the union pressures”.  <br/>At this point, it was very clear we were not going to have a resolve with relation to my DOA, and my 3 main concerns.  At 1715 I interrupted the meeting before it got more heated and addressed the deputy.  I again told him that this was purely about safety, and something we could prevent potential fatal outcome.  I told him we were at obvious impasse, and I would give the forest until 0600 on 9/17/18 to replace our organization, as this was now a refusal for risk and safety, and I was requesting a de-mob of my IMT.  I told him I take my delegation, “life first principles”, firefighter accountability and liability very seriously.  I also reiterated that the actions by his DFMO, himself, and his staff had been a violation of our DOA, and a transfer of my liability without my consent.<br/><br/>The first thing the deputy responded with was, “I’m just curious of how this story will be told, and how it might be said that the forest did not support you based on safety related issues”?  I didn’t really have words for him at this point.  I told him the truth would be told, plain and simple.  I told him that I had always respected him, and that I really felt like he wanted to support me, but whatever was standing in his way and keeping him from doing the right thing, union or not, must really have him pinned down.  I also told him I expected a reciprocal response on why we were leaving when that story was told by the forest.<br/><br/>On 9/15/18 I spoke to the regional contracting officer supervisor, as well as his lead contracting officer and told them what had gone on, and that we had made a refusal for risk and safety and would be demobing.  The CO’s were very concerned that the forest had been promoting free will and choice for their contractors.  They were very clear that they were the only persons with oversight to contractors, and the language in every contract with regard to “length of assignment” meant the expectation of being on sight, in fire camp, and supported by the IMT’s.  The supervisor asked for both the Forest supervisor and deputy’s phone numbers.  They both applauded our decision for refusal and demob repeatedly, and thanked us over and over for trying to keep their contractors safer.<br/><br/>On 9/16/18 we had an in-briefing with the incoming ad-hoc organization.  In closing I did take the opportunity to communicate that we did not in fact timeout on this incident, but rather a refusal for risk and safety had taken place and why.  I also cautioned the IC moving forward about my conversation with the contracting officers the previous day, and their alignment with our decision, and not the local requests.  The incoming IC and trainee immediately approached myself and my trainee, with a quiver full of questions.  They had not been made aware of the refusal.<br/><br/>On 9/17/18 at 0600 I transferred command of the Complex to the incoming IC.  Our closeout meeting with the AA took place at 1000.  Following the closeout I was approached by both the Deputy forest Supervisor as well as the Forest Supervisor outside the office individually, and asked to exclude and or change some of the things that were written in our team’s executive summary for the fire.  I told them I would consider their requests, however I would be falsifying information if I made the changes, so they should not expect any changes.<br/>This was not a comfortable experience for anyone involved.  I feel that if union pressures have now been allowed so much power and say in what goes on in fire, that forest personnel can’t even support decisions of safety without consulting union agreements, then we have definitely gotten off track.  The deputy never got back to me on whether or not it was union policy about his fed employees not being required to stay in camp.  If it is policy somehow, I suppose it should be changed to support life and safety.  I would be curious to hear the chief’s thoughts on this matter, and whether or not her intent is being met through these actions by senior forest personnel.","As, stated above in the narrative, after reaching impasse, I requested a demob of my IMT, as my DOA liability and accountability had been transferred to others without my consent.","10/25/2018 11:17"

The fire had recently been taken over by the Southern Area Red Team. The crew was assigned to DIV PP. There was a large series of indirect lines that encompassed the fire and it was apparent upon arrival that the main fire was miles away from the indirect portions of DIV PP. The initial plan upon arrival was to wait the fire out to see if it would come close enough to the indirect line to justify a large scale firing operation. The area was heavily scarred from the Biscuit Fire in 2002. A firing plan between all divisions was put in place to burn the 35-40 miles of indirect line if necessary. The crew was spiked out during the first week of the incident and would get briefed from the DIVS when he arrived on scene in the morning. <br/><br/><br/>Incident:<br/>The crew was at Spike Camp the morning of Sept. 5th awaiting the arrival of the DIVS for a briefing on the plan for the day. Another IHC informed the crew that the plan for the shift was to burn a line in DIV PP between two drop points. This was confirmed by the DIVS (t) when he arrived on scene.  There was a timber stringer that ran all the way to the top of the ridge and burning between the two drop points would eliminate the possibility of fire that was down below from making a run up to the ridge. The entire back side of the ridge was an old burn scar that burned extremely hot during the Biscuit fire. The fire had been down in the Collier Creek drainage for multiple days and had showed no signs of wanting to move out of the drainage towards the ridgeline. The line that was to be burned had been scouted by the crew during the previous shift and it was determined that there was at least a shift and a half of prep needed due to heavy snag loading along the line. Work began first thing the morning of 9/5 to eliminate the snags with potential to impact the line.  The crew informed DIV PP (t) this mission would not be completed until the following morning (9/6) and both parties agreed that the crew would conduct firing operations on 9/6. Conditions forecasted for 9/6 were favorable and the fire activity was not forcing a firing operation on 9/5. By mid afternoon, the OPSC began contacting DIV PP (t) on command regarding the status of the firing operation. DIV PP (t) informed OPSC that there was still prep needed along the line prior to initiating any firing. Shortly after, DIV PP (t) met with the crew and stated that the IMT wanted the line to be burned during that operational period. The crew informed DIV PP (t) that they would not put any fire on the ground until the snags along the line had been mitigated due to safety concerns regarding resources holding the line during/after firing operations. The OPSC contacted DIV PP (t) multiple times throughout the following hour regarding whether or not fire had been put on the ground. The OPSC also stated that they had other crews available to complete the mission. OPSC then contacted the Branch Director (who was en route to tie in with the crew and DIV PP) and told him that he should probably bring a drip torch up to the drop point with him. Upon talking with the Branch Director, it was agreed that the crew would conduct a test fire on top of the peak to help alleviate the pressure to fire the line that was being pushed down onto the crew. The crew conducted a test fire at the top of Game Peak and left the line a few hours later. The firing operation was successfully completed the following shift (9/6) after the crew had completed the snagging operation. <br/><br/>Summary:<br/>An enormous amount of pressure was put upon the crew to complete the firing operation when there were no fire line factors forcing the crew to burn the line on 9/5. Multiple comments were made by the OPSC on the command frequency that were extremely unprofessional and put the crew in a very uncomfortable position. The crew didn’t have any opposition with firing the line, the only request made was to wait until the hazards had been mitigated prior to firing. It also became clear that this type of pressure was occurring on other divisions around the fire.<br/> 	It was apparent that the IMT was receiving pressure from the agency to accomplish certain missions around the fire. Instead of absorbing the pressure and allowing the resources on the ground to complete the missions safely, the IMT was pushing that pressure down to the resources on the ground. The crew handled this situation in a very professional manner, which is why the compromise was made with the Branch Director to conduct a test fire on 9/5 and complete the firing operation on 9/6. The concern with what occurred on 9/5 is the possibility of another resource being in that situation and being pressured to conduct firing operations on a line that was unsafe to fire. If the line had been burned during that shift, the chances of a person and/or vehicle being struck by a snag afterwards were high.","Maintained positive communications with the DIVS and Branch Director. Started a test fire on top of the peak to alleviate the pressure being put on the crew to burn the line on 9/5.

They were filling out of the Rogue River at Foster's Bar just east of Agness, OR.  The trash pumps use straight gas and were being filled by 5 gallon Jerry Cans (Manufacture Wavian NATO Part# JC0020RVS).  The gas cans were attached to the trash pump by a chain with lock so the cans would not walk off.  The pumps and gas cans were sitting out in the hot sun. The cans were close to the pumps which were quite hot. <br/><br/>A taskforce leader for the water tenders approached me at approx. 16:00.  He let me know that two of his tender operators had gas cans geyser covering them from head to toe with gas; enough that they needed to return to camp to shower. The tender drivers were very upset.  The geysering took place when the tender driver opened the 5 gallon can to install the separate nozzle.  The can does not release built up pressure.  When the pin in the lid is pulled and the cap released the pressure blows open the cap and sprays a significant amount of gas forward of the can.  The separate nozzle has a built in pressure release valve and eliminates the problem when it is installed.  The issue occurs when the cover is opened for installation of the nozzle.  The fire has approximately 30 of these cans on the fire line.  <br/>The concern is having the gas spray on the fire fighter with the potential to ignite and cause severe burn injuries.","The Task Force Leader was directed to go to Ground Support and replace the cans with standard 5 gallon safety can with a flexible metal nozzle.  The next day 6/4/18 myself and SOF2 (t) visited the site and verified that the cans had been switched out.   On 6/5/18 I visited Ground Support to see the cans that had geysered.  I noticed that the cans were brand new and that it wasn’t just an isolated case.  I notified the IC to appraise him of the situation and he said that it is a known issue.  He said we would have to keep the cans in service since we would not have enough cans to support the incident without them and that the cache would just send us more of the same.  To mitigate the issue I briefed all resources on the geysering and to open the cover while standing behind the cap hinge.  I also recommended they store the cans in the shade before opening to avoid pressure buildup.  In the past 4 days we have not had any new incidents of cans geysering.  This issue was also brought up on the Region 6 daily Safety Conference call.  There are pictures of the cans including a warning sign on the can that says “DANGER Fuel UNDER PRESSURE and may GEYSER”.","09/13/2018 09:34"

Upon receiving a dispatch to a single lightning struck tree approximately 1115 on Aug 23rd, I called dispatch via landline to get further information regarding the incident. At this time I was informed that there was a single patrol unit from the neighboring district on scene but had not checked in with dispatch and could not be reached by radio. Gathering legal location and area description, Engine XXX left the station to the Incident. <br/><br/>Approximately 1215 we heard the broken traffic from the patrol who was incident commander gave a rough size up. Dispatch told the Fire IC that an engine was in route but was not requested. <br/><br/>Engine XXX was at the on scene at the heel of the fire around 1245 we established communication with the Patrol and after a short hike to the fireline, at 1325 and I made face to face contact with the IC.<br/><br/>After a very brief conversation with the IC, I discovered that he was indeed a trainee.

I do not know the circumstances that placed this individual on a fire alone and without a qualified trainer. However I do know the fire was 1000 feet off the road in very steep and rocky terrain in an area that this individual is not familiar with and extremely bad communications and was by himself on scene. In fact he had hiked up once to look at it, then hiked down and back up with a backpack pump. There were several attempts by our local dispatch center to reach him via radio prior to Engine XXX being dispatched. Ultimately my safety concern here, just to make it clear, is that an unqualified individual was sent out to the fireline to check a fire.","I took command of the fire upon being on scene as well as I took command of the medical emergency with due to the steep and rockiness of the terrain involved a short haul and an air ambulance as well as ground transport standing by.","08/30/2018 09:28"

Once we established a command structure, we were able to assign, communicate with, and account for all resources on the incident.","Once it was determined that the incident did not have a clear Incident Commander or leadership structure in place, we immediately established a unified command with the local county fire chief. Our ICT3 team established divisions, assigned division supervisors, relayed a communication plan, and accounted for all resources on the fire. An action plan and tactical assignments were also communicated to all resources on the fire.<br/><br/>After the incident, incident and unit level leadership discussed the complexities of responding to incidents under federal jurisdiction that involve many different cooperators. The importance of establishing a federal agency incident commander, or at a minimum a chief of party or point of contact, was discussed as an essential step to safely managing such complex incidents on federal lands.","08/08/2018 13:36"

He had not returned, and had not told me he would be late, which is very unusual especially as he was nearing 12 hours on one shift. At 1800 I began to worry, not knowing what time Dispatch would be closing so I headed into the office to have them do a radio check.  I saw in the sign out book that he was due back at 1700.  I saw the Forest FMO and asked if anybody had heard from my significant other, as he was past due by an hour and a half according to his check out. I asked if anybody had checked his ETA.  FMO said nobody had done an ETA check, but the employee had done a radio check sometime earlier that day and Dispatch had not heard from him since. FMO said he would try to call him on Dispatch radio.  FMO tried three times with no contact from the employee, using three different repeaters.<br/><br/>The Forest FMO came out of Dispatch and advised me to call him on his cell phone, to which I replied that I had been trying and he was obviously out of cell service, thus the need for a radio check since he was an hour and a half late in his return to station time listed in the check out book. No further attempts were made to contact the missing employee.

The wind was out of the west and the previous nights burn was holding successfully , at around 1400 we were called by our Strike team leader (STEN)to meet with them about a mission for division (DIVS), (in route we heard that division actual was using his drip torch and lighting fire with the dozers that were assigned to the division) we met with our STEN and he told us that our DIVS wanted us to lay hose down hill toward active fire to light off a section of line at the top of the ridge along County line road after discussion with the other engine and the the STEN we concluded that the line was not wide enough to hold and that we did not know what the fire or DIVS were doing below. The fire at this point was flanking toward a drainage to the south as the winds would occasionally surface and increase the fire behavior moving it toward the north closer to the planned operation, the road and dozer line formed a 90 degree angle going north along county line road and to the west along a ridge above the papoose arm of trinity lake. The type 2 crew decided to move closer to the fires edge and construct line indirect in the drainage and wanted us to lay hose after they were done, there was a road below and we told the STEN and DIVS that we would feel a lot safer if we could go direct and lay hose from the bottom, the type 2 crew ended up taking our hose and were approximately 300ft out of 700ft to finish and were chased out of the drainage, that mission was abandoned and we were asked to work with the dozers down below where the DIVS had lit fire.<br/>   I tied in with the dozer boss and tried to figure out what was wanted of us, I found out at that point that the DIVS was attempting to stay ahead of the fire by lighting off of the dozer line as we had heard on the radio earlier, the dozer boss had stated that he had been working with this DIVS for the past few days and that he had not felt safe with the DIVS actions on previous shifts. During the my discussion with the dozer boss the fire had jumped the dozer line 100 yards to the west of my engine the STEN trainee was scouting it while my engine and the other one were getting in position to attack the spot, the engines started laying hose as I tied in with the division trainee and I asked him what the fire below us was doing, he had told me that the fire was not active below and that we had plenty of time to take care of the spot I turned around to meet with my crew and they were approximately 5 packs into there lay 500ft when DIVS trainee called to abandon the hose lay that it had crossed there trigger point below us, I had found out later that there were no resources below us holding the line along the ridge line that extended to Trinity lake approximately two miles of line. We pulled out of that portion of line back to County line road as the DIVS trainee got accountability for the resources, while the DIVS trainee was  finishing up the accountability the DIVS actual was planning to fire from trinity mountain road up toward county line road within a plantation, as I was sitting with DIVS trainee I was able to discuss that I thought that was a bad idea and thankfully the type 2 crew he was asking to perform the burn talked him out of it as this would cause head fire and would create a lot of holding concerns.","For the initial down hill hose lay we had brought up that we would work from the lower road up toward county line road going direct, that plan was rejected and the type 2 crew started laying hose as we went to the bottom to go pump the hose lay, that was abandoned and we were sent to work with the dozers.<br/>   With the work along the dozer line I was keeping the crew closer to the engine as I was already uncomfortable with the decisions being made, we were slower to action as I was trying to figure out what the fire was doing on our section of line. I had the STEN actual as our lookout looking from our location back to the east and down the next drainage to the north. I was told by DIVS trainee that the had eyes down below toward the lake and that the fire wasn't doing much as we laid hose on the spot. We left the hose lay in place as we were told to abandon that mission and we loaded up and returned to County line road and told DIVS trainee in person that he had accountability for my engine.","08/24/2018 13:50"

The hillside was North Facing and the Fuel type was grass, sage, and bitterbrush. The air attack consisted of 2 VLATs, 6 additional Tankers, and 7 Rotor wing aircraft on a 1000 acre and growing fire. Structures had already been lost and more were threatened. The flank where the incident occurred was of relatively low to moderate priority to the fires suppression.<br/>  <br/>A Forest Service Helitack crew along with multiple modules made up from four different agencies were assigned to construct direct hand line on an underslung flank of the emerging incident. The combined handvcrew began line construction at around 1600 hours. At that time multiple rotor wing aircraft had been holding the flank with bucket drops and fire activity was relatively low. After about 1.5 hours of line construction the lead saw team (myself + 1) reached a hotter section of the underslung line.  At this point we decided to hold progression until the line dig was closer to our position.  Simultaneously the 10 Person BLM hand crew arrived to the front of the progression. At this point it was decided that we would quickly control hot section of line together , before a bump was made. Flame lengths were 3-5' at this time.<br/><br/> Shortly after beginning work on the section I was alerted by my swamper who spotted a Type 3 Helicopter making a low drop directly in front of us. According to the swamper as well as other members of the crew the aircraft had come in and entered a hover before making the drop. I however was only able to see a rotorwash- driven flare up pushing towards myself and the crew. The crew scrambled and scattered down the hillside leaving behind tools, water bottles and dolmars. The large flare up lasted no longer than 1 minute, but due to the flashy fuel type and the close proximity to the fire it made for a hazardous situation.<br/><br/>The helicopters drop was unexpected and presumably not requested (by ground resources) The aircraft that made the drop was in fact my crews helicopter and the manager (on scene) attempted to make contact with the pilot but was unable to reach. The pilot later stated that he was unable to respond or acknowledge the radio call because he was focused on making the drop and holding his position. I recall glancing down and seeing the helicopter dip out of the river just below us and then returning to work, not expecting that it was coming to my location. <br/><br/>In debriefing with the pilot it was revealed that he had just returned from a fuel cycle, and had been directed (by AIR-ATTACK)to stay lower on the slope due to Fixed Wing Activity coming over the ridge line. In essence the helicopter was 'sandwiched' between the upper 3rd of the slope and the lower third which did not require further bucket work. The pilot was aware that a crew was near the drop but did not know which crew it was. The pilot acknowledges that he failed to make contact for that reason.","The lessons that myself, the pilot, and members of the crew can take away from this are as follows.<br/><br/>1) Make contact with ALL aircraft working in your area as soon as possible<br/><br/>2) If a pilot is uncertain of a radio message or unable to answer a call, they should consider aborting a drop and pulling away so communication can be established. <br/><br/>3) On an incident involving complex air operations it is important for ground resources and air resources to be cognizant of the associated increase in difficulty, and to allow a larger margin for safety around aircraft. The best way to achieve this margin is through thorough and frequent communication with air resources.","08/06/2018 15:24"

The trailer had been unhooked from the Semi, and dropped off the day previous.<br/><br/>At that point the cache removed a pallet of pumps with a forklift and the crew walked back to the front of the trailer.  At that point, the trailer tipped forward at a fairly slow speed, ending with the nose of the trailer on the ground ,and the back wheels about 6 feet up in the air. The 3 crewmembers slid to the front, uninjured.","The first thing done was to extricate the 3 camp personnel from the trailer.  Next SOFR requested facilities to flag and stake around the trailer to keep interested onlookers away from the trailer while a solution was discussed.<br/><br/>The local Cache was called to consult on a solution.

The Trailer was held in place with the forklift while the 5 pallets in the front end were shifted to the back with a pallet jack to balance the load.<br/><br/>Recommendation made to Supply, was that in the future, if a trailer (especially a short one) is left in camp, a load jack needs to be supplied by the trucking company.

The fuels truck was almost brand new, with roughly 3,000 miles on it, and this was the first time the vehicle had been driven on unpaved roads. While the fuels truck was driving uphill on a dirt road, the driver heard a loud hiss coming from the rear of the vehicle. The driver immediately stopped the vehicle, applied the parking break, and inspected the vehicle. Upon further investigation, it was found that the inside rear dual tire on the passenger side was melted, to the point where a hole had formed and air was rapidly escaping. Fearing that the weakened, melted tire could potentially blow out, the driver and passenger kept a safe distance from the damaged tire, and placed a radio call to back to the district office notifying them of the issue. <br/>Once the tire had depressurized, the driver and passenger investigated the problem and found that the rivets on the bump stop had failed, and it had fallen between the axle and the tire. The heat generated by the friction between the bump stop and the inside dual tire melted the rubber near the rim, and caused the tire to fail. This information was relayed to the District AFMO and Engine Captain, who drove out to the scene to help the crew. After a brief inspection and discussion, they decided to drive back to the district. Upon returning to the district, the tire was replaced and the bump stop was bolted back to the frame.","Before the bump stop and tire were replaced, pictures were taken of damaged areas and failed rivets.

These ICS 206 WFs were published in the Incident Action Plans (IAPs) for the Lake Christine Fire on 7/21/18.<br/>The MIRs in those ICS 206 WFs were modified from that which is found in the current IRPG by substituting “Contact Med Unit/Communications” in lieu of “CONTACT COMMUNICATIONS/DISPATCH” in line 1 of the 8 Line.  Additionally, in the example for line 1, “Ex: Med Unit Lead” was substituted in lieu of “Ex: Communications,”.  In line 2’s example, “Ex: Med Unit Lead” was substituted in lieu of “Ex: Communications,”.<br/>These modifications are inconsistent with the instructions at the top of the page which state:  “FOR A MEDICAL EMERGENCY:  IDENTIFY ON SCENE INCIDENT COMMANDER BY NAME AND ANNOUNCE ‘MEDICAL EMERGENCY’ TO INITIATE RESPONSE FROM IMT COMMUNICATIONS/DISPATCH.”; and “Use the following items to communicate situation to communications/dispatch.”  This inconsistency, in and of itself, can be a source of confusion. <br/>Of greater concern is the deviation itself.  Has this deviation from professional discipline been properly authorized?<br/>Failure to follow an established standard, procedure, or requirement is a common factor that has emerged from accident investigations.  Oftentimes, such violations occur when an established procedure is considered inconvenient or unnecessary; or the violator believes he or she has the authority or status to violate the guidance.  When a procedure or requirement is circumvented in the interest of completing work more efficiently, the result can be counterproductive or even lethal. <br/>Starting on or about July 20, 2018, Division/Group Assignment Lists (ICS 204 WFs) were prepared and reviewed for Divisions N, S, W, and the Swing Group (Division) which included the following in the special instruction block of the ICS 204 WF:  “Contact MEDL direct for medical emergency.”  The special instruction blocks in the ICS 204 WF for Divisions A/Z did not have this instruction.  These ICS 204 WFs were published in the Incident Action Plans (IAPs) for the Lake Christine Fire on 7/21/18.<br/>Starting July 21, 2018, an ICS 204 WF was prepared and reviewed for the Aviation Mobile Water Support Group which included the following in the special instruction block of the ICS 204 WF:  “Contact MEDL direct for medical emergency.”   This ICS 204 WF was published in the Incident Action Plans (IAPs) for the Lake Christine Fire on 7/21/18.<br/>Starting July 22, 2018, an ICS 204 WF was prepared and reviewed for Division U which did not have a special instruction for contact in a medical emergency.  This ICS 204 WF was published in the Incident Action Plans (IAPs) for the Lake Christine Fire on 7/21/18.<br/>Starting July 25, 2018, an ICS 204 WF was prepared and reviewed for Division A/Z/W which did not have a special instruction for contact in a medical emergency; and an ICS 204 WF was prepared and reviewed for the Holding Division which included the following in the special instruction block of the ICS 204 WF:  “Contact MEDL direct for medical emergency.”   These ICS 204 WFs were published in the Incident Action Plans (IAPs) for the Lake Christine Fire on 7/21/18.<br/>Deviating from emergency medical care procedures established in the IRPG by shifting the primary communication responsibilities in a medical emergency from the Communication Unit to the Medical Unit Leader (MEDL) can be a source of confusion.  Unless they are alerted to this change, field resources may be more likely to follow the familiar procedure in the IRGP rather than following the deviation in the IAP.  Medical emergencies reported to the Communications unit on this IMT would at some point transition to the MEDL.  Adequacy and consistency in documentation of an incident within an incident (IWI) under such conditions is an additional concern.<br/>By directing communications to the MEDL instead of the Communications Unit, the MEDL assumes the role and responsibility of the Communications Unit.  The Communication Unit’s role becomes passive and is limited to recording the emergency medical traffic heard over the radio or which takes place in the Communication Center, and assisting the IWI team as directed.<br/>A deterioration in the proficiency of communication resources may be an ancillary impact.  By reducing the role of communication personnel in medical emergencies, they cannot fully exercise their knowledge, skills and abilities, and are essentially deprived of potential opportunities to maintain or improve their proficiency.  This, in turn, does little in the way of preparing them to handle an IWI on their next assignment.<br/>In a memorandum to the NWCG Executive Board dated January 27, 2014, the NWCG Executive Board Chair announced an update of the IRPG which added a new reference for a MIR.  The intent of the IRPG is to provide a wildland fire job aid and training reference for operational personnel from Firefighter Type 2 through Division Supervisor and initial attack/extended attack Incident Commanders.  <br/>The Rocky Mountain IMT2 Black Team’s deviation fails to meet the NMCG’s intent.  Has this deviation been managed strategically?  Is the justification for this variance based on actual metrics and sound analysis?<br/>Not all firefighters will have an Incident Action Plan but nearly all do have an IRPG.  Our firefighters are training using the Medical Incident Report found in the IRPG and in a high stress situation they will likely revert back to that training making it imperative the Communications Unit, Medical Unit, and others are using the same initial report format.  Use of the standard reporting format is just as necessary for initial and extended attack incidents, particularly when the fire is being staffed by interagency or off unit resources.  The NMAC correspondence encourages wildland fire resources, IMTs, and local unit coordination centers to train using the standard MIR.  <br/>The development and maintenance of personal, professional and organizational habits of excellence is a key to success in any organization.  When individual resources are helped to improve their performance, the result is higher quality results and happier people.  Does this deviance serve this purpose?  Or will it prove to be an error producing condition? <br/>If this deviation has been properly authorized and has been found to be organizationally valuable, the deviation should become the new standard in the IRPG; and communication responsibilities in medical emergencies should be transferred to the Medical Unit, rather than permitting inconsistency in how communications are handled during medical emergencies on incidents.","Received clarification of the deviant emergency medical communication protocol; discussed concerns with the Incident Communication Center Manager and the Communications Unit Leaders (COMLs).  The COMLs discussed their concerns with the MEDL.  The COML documented the benefits of continued use of the standard protocol for emergency medical communications.  The MEDL documented the benefits of the deviant protocol for emergency medical communications.  This documentation was submitted for consideration to the Team’s Incident Commander.  Starting July 28, 2018, the MIR published in the IAP was the same as in the current IRPG; however, some of the ICS 204 WFs still continued to have the following special instruction:  “Contact MEDL direct for medical emergency.”  Afterwards, the MIR published in subsequent IAPs again deviated from what is found in the current IRPG.","08/22/2018 08:39"

The can was an NFES item (0606) recently received from the SOPS cache.<br/><br/>This condition presented a potential significant safety hazard from leaking fuel particularly if the can were to be tipped on its side,  a definite possibility when being flown in a net.  Needless to say, a fuel leak during transportation, aviation or fire line operations presents a danger to personnel and equipment on the fire.","I used a hammer to pry the linkage back into a functional alignment prior to delivery to the helibase.

I didn't inform anyone that was the direction given and left it up to them to decide for themselves.

Shortly after the cloning took place however, none of the radios would transmit. We took the radio’s to the Forest Radio Tech to diagnose the problem. Radio Tech: “DMH Radios “appeared” to clone fine however, once cloned all 4 radios would not key up {TX}. I tried to key it up with various microphones but that had no effect, so it isn’t a microphone issue. I suspected possible issues with cloning cable or a bad clone. I reprogrammed the radios with a known good code plug, the radios still would not key up. I cloned a group from one of my DPHs and same results. I had the DPH radio and Cloning cable that were used to clone the DMH radios but was reluctant to try and clone another DMH radio as it might also mess one of mine up, so I tried cloning an old GMH and had no problems, it cloned and transmitted fine. I put one of the bad DMH’s on the bench and tried to do a TX power adjustment, that worked ok so the XMTR itself is capable of putting out RF power. However the radios will not “ key up/TX” when I attempt to do so with a microphone{s}. Talked to several techs and tech support personnel at BK and it appears that “something” in the cloning process probably damaged a component on the transmitter board{s} and radios will have to be sent back to the factory for repairs. It could have been a faulty DPH or a faulty cloning cable, however they “appeared” to work fine when I tried to duplicate the problem in the shop. One other “possible” cause of the problem the something called the “ Group 99 Virus”, it is a “Virus” that has the potential to “Brick” a cloned radio… that MAY have been what caused the problem with these 4 radios, even though Relm/BK says it is highly unlikely. The DPH handheld radio used to clone the 4 DMH’s has this “group 99 virus”. See Link and explanation below. “During the cloning process, this corruption has the potential of making one out of five radios being cloned totally unusable. This is called “Bricking”—making your radio as useful as a brick. Once a radio “Bricks” it must be sent back to the factory for reconditioning. There is no other way to fix a “Bricked” radio” http://www.bocofire.org/rt130/radios/Bendix%20King%20DPH%20Cloning%20Corruption.pdf <br/>I am sending the 4 DMH radios back to the Santa Fe radio shop so they can send them to BK for repairs, which is what BK techs suggest. “ Just something to be aware of, particularly the virus. We are on borrowed truck radios and the one hand held and will let you know what we find when the radios come back from Bendix King.","'something similar happen a couple of seasons ago. For some reason a DPH that was used to clone multiple DMH radios changed some settings. In the SEC column in the programming software it had change the setting to ENC (Encryption). It should be set to CLR. It also changed the setting in the KEY column to 24. It is normally set to 1. I don’t think that setting matters much but the ENC definitely does. <br/> <br/>Not sure if this is a fix for this issue but it’s something to check.'<br/><br/><br/>We are waiting to hear from Bendix King to see if they have any ideas, but it is something to be aware of.","07/19/2018 14:38"

The mountain tops where the involved repeaters are located are hundreds of miles apart, so bleed over should be impossible.  The radio tech contacted Moducum and determined that a system software issue is causing bleed-over when more than one dispatch pod transmits at a time.  Moducom indicated that a software fix for the problem would take up to a week to write.  <br/><br/>Simul-select:  Dispatchers are not able to select multiple frequencies to tone out fires, read the weather, tone out alerts, or extend staffing.  <br/><br/>As a result, dispatchers are only able to transmit on one frequency at a time.  The dispatch center monitors 10 frequencies for emergency traffic, with a dispatcher at each of 6 pods.  Currently only one dispatcher can transmit at a time.

We were able to talk on a USFS repeater (Loge) with another fire unit, but we could not reach dispatch. There was a spot along the drive in, about 5-10 minute drive down the road where you can hit a BLM repeater, BLM Sunlight, but it is very scratchy and somewhat unreadable, however a simple emergency transmission could probably be relayed. Two firefighters further down the road were able to talk to dispatch via radio/cell phone and let dispatch know that we were hiking on a well-established trail to observe the fire, but not engage.<br/>When we reached the lookout spot along the trail, approximately 1-2 miles away from the smoke report, we were still unable to hit a repeater that could reach dispatch and there was no cellphone service.  We were able to reach the two firefighters, who were not hiking into the fire, on a line-of-sight radio channel.  They had moved to our hike-in spot, the Maroon Bells parking lot, to have better communication with us and to try and locate the fire with binoculars.  Communications between us and the two firefighters were clear, however we had no communications with dispatch.  We were able to take observations of the fuels and location of the smoke report for resource advisors, however, we never saw any active indicators of fire.

No cease and desist for radio traffic was issued due to the emergency<br/>2. No 8-line was used in the assessment of the patient. The blue team operations, communications and medical did not prompt for the 8-line nor was it identified in morning briefing to use that process.<br/>3. No IC was identified<br/>4.

This observation is being made based on the lack of decision making that was implemented and communicated<br/>5. There is a type one helicopter listed in the IAP for medical emergency in country that cannot be easily accessed by such a ship while a type three was available at camp maybe two air miles from the incident<br/>6. The communications coming from the team over the radio was indecisive, the plan changed constantly.  At one point the plan was to fly the patient to the basecamp (approx. two miles from incident) and then transport via the ambulance to town (approximately a 45 mile drive on windy narrow roads).  I get that part of that decision was based off not having a medically equipped ship to respond but they type three, in camp from Grand Canyon (who deal with this all the time) was ready with a paramedic and heart monitor to take off and transport directly to the hospital (about a nine minute flight from incident) and this decision was never approved.  Ship finally took off which from radio traffic the Type 3 crew kept prodding the resources from Blue Team gathered in the comm tent to let them take off and transport the patient directly to the hospital. <br/>7.  finally the type three took off with a paramedic and heart monitor with direction to return the patient to camp and transport after patient assessment via ground transportation<br/>8. ship arrived on scene, made assessment and went directly to the hospital with an unstable patient (kudos to them if they ignored direction to return to camp and it should be noted that from radio traffic it appears the crew on the ship made the call to go directly to the hospital but I admit this is an assumption from piecing together traffic)<br/>9. at 1308 hrs the ship took off to the hospital, two hours after the first call.  an ambulance could have arrived from fort davis in about thirty minutes if dispatched and the ambulance at base camp could probably arrive in the same amount of time.  patient was not on the road based on radio traffic (unit calling in the incident said that they were not near a road)<br/>10. this fire is cold and the team that was calling in the medical was a TIFMAS team, city firefighters who make up a strike team.  Unclear why they appeared to have hiked in on a cold line.  If they did hike in were they really physically fit for the assignment? Not armchair quarterbacking here, just asking the questions we all wondered from the field as we followed radio traffic <br/>11.  several times fredericksburg dispatch who was communicating with scenic loop communications (SLC) to make sure appropriate medical resources were on scene asked SLC if they had an ambulance on scene or did she need to order one for when the ship landed back at base camp, in snarky response the individual communicating with her told her repeatedly they had ground transportation.  She asked twice more to please clarify they had an ambulance and each time was told they had ground transport for the patient.  Ground transport is NOT necessarily an ambulance, they should have confirmed with her they did indeed have an ambulance<br/>12. SLC asked for the patients name on the radio<br/>13.  Asked my resources if they had ever heard it identified in morning briefing that the command channel and way to reach ICP was to call 'scenic loop communications', none had heard it including myself<br/>14. repeaters continue to not work or not be monitored by the team on this fire, they installed a new repeater and gave it to us today.  we tried several times to contact for a radio test on it with no success<br/><br/>This incident raised a lot of concern for my division, we had an AAR on this issue and I would be remiss not to file a safenet as their leader.

We arrived on the fire the morning of June 8 and were assigned to DIV Alpha. <br/><br/>We tied in with our Division Supervisor and the Bonneville Hotshot Crew. The plan was to backfire a small piece of ground that Bonneville had scouted out and prepped. <br/><br/>Adverse winds caused the burn to be shutdown by the current Incident Commander so the crews held the division through the operational period. <br/><br/>The plan between the Operations Section Chief, Division Supervisor, Bonneville Hotshot Superintendent and myself was to reinitiate the firing operation once conditions warranted. <br/><br/>The Bonneville IHC Superintendent had scouted the potential of going direct and with the forecasted weather, excessive snags and fire behavior that they had experienced the shift before, had decided the indirect option was a safer choice.  <br/><br/>After taking all that information into consideration, I concurred with his assessment of the tactics being employed. <br/><br/>In addition, an approaching cold front was going to cause us to hold what ground we had and wait for favorable conditions. <br/><br/>Weather forecasted for the next two operational periods were temps in the high 60's to low 70's, RH's in the teens and high winds (10-15, gusts to 30) from the west/southwest. <br/><br/>Weather observations taken by the crew on 6/9 and 6/10 mirrored the forecasted weather. <br/><br/>On the evening of 6/9 we (Redding IHC and Bonneville IHC) again confirmed with the Division Supervisor and Operations Section Chief that the firing plan was still the plan once conditions allowed.  We were also informed that there was a new ICT3 on the incident.     <br/><br/>On the morning of 6/10, the new Incident Commander Type 3 (ICT3) arrived at Drop Point 15 and met with myself and the Bonneville IHC overhead. <br/><br/>The ICT3 wanted to take a look at the potential of going direct. He was going to scout the line and invited us to join him. <br/><br/>The Redding IHC Captains and Crew Boss Trainee accompanied the Bonneville CRWB trainee and the ICT3 during the scouting mission from the top of the line. I drove around to the bottom of the fire line and scouted towards them. <br/><br/>When we met up, we had a discussion about the tactics we planned on employing. <br/><br/>The ICT3 explained to us that 'normally the Incident Commander doesn't get involved in tactics but in this case he saw a need to intervene and that if he hadn't come up there, we would've continued to do nothing'.<br/><br/>He believed he saw an opportunity to pick the fire up direct and that we had to get the firing option out of our minds. He reiterated over and over that our planned firing operation was not going to happen. <br/><br/>The ICT3 turned to the Bonneville CRWB(t) and told him that if his crew didn't want to take the assignment (direct) that he'd find another hotshot crew to complete the assignment and send them to another, mellower assignment. <br/><br/>The ICT3 turned his attention to me and asked my thoughts on the section of line. I told him that I had major concerns with committing the crew on the piece of ground with all the snags, especially with the windy conditions forecasted. I also had concerns with being able to go direct and actually contain the fire due to the uneven edge, fuel loading and numerous spot fires. He exclaimed that he didn't see any more hazard trees than any other fire we were assigned to. <br/><br/>The ICT3 explained to me that we could use MIST (Minimum Impact Suppression Tactics) in the mixed conifer fuel type.  He questioned our knowledge and experience of tactics we wanted to employ and he wouldn't listen to our concerns. <br/><br/>I explained to him that in my opinion, the direct option in that fuel type wasn't a sound tactic and that the planned firing operation would be the safest and most efficient tactic.  If successful, we'd have a straight and solid containment line with limited exposure to the crews. <br/><br/>He vehemently disagreed with me and told me that there would be no firing operation and that, again, we had to just get that option out of our minds. <br/><br/>The ICT3 then explained to us that he was the leader and we were the subordinates and that we needed to do what we were being told. I disagreed with him and told him that his leadership style was extremely subpar and that the disrespectful way he was trying to bully us into taking an assignment was unprofessional, unwarranted and unappreciated. <br/><br/>I then again informed him that we wouldn't be committing the crew into the drainage due to the fire line conditions and our safety concerns. <br/><br/>We (Redding IHC and Bonneville IHC) requested a meeting with the Operations Section Chief.  We told him of the interaction with the ICT3 and he was surprised as he and the ICT3 had not discussed any changes to the plan of burning the line if conditions gave us the opportunity to do so.","We turned down the assignment and gave the ICT3 another option in regards to meeting the objective.","07/03/2018 13:46"

No effort was made by the supervisor to take a portable generator to the repeater site to run it. On Monday, the repeater was still non-functional.  About mid-day the supervisor was ask why 1 of the Forest generators couldn't/hadn't been taken to the site to run the repeater. The supervisor agreed that might be a good idea. A fire was reported shortly afterwards. Ground units on the fire were only able to communicate with dispatch via relay from the air attack over the fire. An AD communications technician (retired from the Forest) was ordered to set up a portable repeater. He would arrive about 1800. In the mid-afternoon the supervisor and the new radio technician went up to the repeater site with a generator. Another fire was reported in the late afternoon. Ground resources were able to use a secondary repeater however, they were difficult to hear because of the distance from their location to that repeater. The primary repeater covers the area of the fire. The supervisor and technician attached the generator, got it running and the repeater began to work. The ordered communications technician's order was cancelled because the primary repeater was functioning and the portable was no longer needed. Per the supervisor, the generator stopped working. The repeater went off the air again.  They were able to get the generator running again for a few minutes before it stopped working again. They restarted it again and it continued running.  The repeater came back on line.  The supervisor and communications technician left the site. A few minutes later the repeater stopped working again. The supervisor was contacted via phone and said he didn't know what to do about it and they were headed back.  The Forest Fire Staff Officer was advised of the situation. He ordered the AD technician to be ordered again to report the next morning. The supervisor contacted dispatch and requested they order a very large generator for the next morning. Dispatch advised him that the AD technician had been ordered. The supervisor then decided to return to the repeater site. When they arrived, they found the generator still working. They made an attempt to determine the problem and advised dispatch they had texted their findings to the AD technician so he could work on it the next day. The repeater was working at that time but the supervisor did not know how long that would last. One of the fires reported on Monday was staffed overnight.","I was on a day off on Sunday. Dispatch staff immediately advised the Communications Supervisor of the problem and utilized a back up system to regain communications to most of the Zone. A trouble ticket was submitted. On Monday, dispatch staff advised the supervisor of the continued problems and suggested taking a generator to the site. Dispatch ordered the AD communications technician to set up the portable repeater for the first fire to alleviate the communication issue for that fire.","06/06/2018 10:06"

The zone has been in Stage 1 fire restrictions since May 1st and just went into Stage 2 June 1st.  An Eastern Oregon Task Force ordered for severity arrived at the Columbine RD office on the morning of 5/31/2018 for their in briefing and to receive Columbine RD Fire group/zone radio clone.  Because of the amount of WUI and the strong Mutual Aid agreements that are in place with local cooperators, the San Juan NF Fire groups/zones utilize User Code Guard (UCG)/ User TX Tone Picklist functionality in order to have all necessary federal and local channels accessible within a single group/zone.  The Eastern Oregon Task Force mainly consists of BLM and have KNG-P150s handheld radios and KNG-M150 mobile radios.  Upon receiving the clones and the channel plan for Columbine RD Fire, many personnel did not know what user select tones were, nor were their radios setup for to support this functionality.  Columbine’s FMO tried to program picklist tones and/or activate UCG within their radio’s Keypad Programming Menu, but the option to do so had been removed from their radios or were not available due to very old firmware versions the radios were operating on.  All of this is happening during Red Flag conditions, and finally the FMO called the San Juan NF Electronics Technician (ET) for assistance around 1230.  We are in a unique radio model transitional period – currently we are seeing more KNG model radios being used in the fire organizations and after talking to some Task Force members, they mentioned that many of them just received these new types of radios (mainly the KNG-M150) in their engines/trucks and were not formally trained on how to use them.  Most did not know how to clone to them (enter destination clone mode), or how or why the radios were setup the way they were.  There has been and will continue to be instances similar to this, highlighting the NEED for a national standard for configuring KNG model handheld (KNG-P150s, KNG-P150, KNG2-P150) and mobile (KNG-M150, KNG-M150R) radios and picklist tones.  It is just a matter of time before someone is hurt or killed because of this.","The San Juan NF ET arrived at the Columbine RD office at 1530 to assist.  After arriving and taking stock of what was at issue, it was determined that each handheld and mobile radio had to be reprogrammed through Radio Editor Software (RES) in order to enable and build out user picklist tones.  Upon going through this process, the ET realized that just about every single radio was running firmware versions that were 3 + years old and nearly all radios were configured differently.  The ET did not have legacy RES software and was forced to update all radio firmware versions on KNG handhelds and mobile radios in order to reprogram the Task Force’s radios.  This process took several hours as the ET also trained Task Force members how to clone their KNG-M150R (remote head cloning has to be done on the main chassis, not on the remote head – many hard to access) and teach them how to use the picklist to select TX tones.  At 1700, the Task Force left the Columbine RD office to report to their duty location – with an overall 7 hour gap in service during red flag conditions.","06/11/2018 16:10"

This level of exposure persisted two more operational periods when on 5/14 we identified the need for heavy equipment and some miscellaneous metal and barrels that might indicate hazardous materials. The crew passed this up to DIVS and proposed moving the bulk of the crew out with one to two individuals working heat along the perimeter including digging, cold-trailing, and breathing smoke to ensure containment and eventually establishing at the direction of the IC and DIVS; a sprinkler system, which involved a squad of 4-7 individuals. On a daily basis during this period Gannett Glacier communicated concerns with the plan for the pit with proposals for the use of equipment and identifying specific type and history of hazmat. This continued through to the 16th. On the 17th we were informed of the potential for more Hazmat then originally thought and we stopped placing people at the disposal site. We pulled all hose and left sprinklers in place to reduce further exposure. We requested and provided input regarding research into the extent of hazmat and a real plan to deal with what we saw as a significant control issue almost daily from 5/12-5/16. It was not until 5/17 that we received confirmation that there was significant amounts of hazardous materials and that an investigation was being initiated.","An investigation has been initiated by local fire managers and the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, to identify specific type and quantity of hazardous materials. Working with the DIVS and IC /IC(t) we took steps to control the issue with minimal exposure to additional crew-members including a sprinkler system to 'cap' the fire to prevent exterior spotting. All operations involving the crew were ceased at end of shift on 5/16/17.  Exposure documentation as assigned by the State of Alaska has been completed for all crew members to the best of our ability with the information available to the crew at this time. At this time the State of Alaska does not have an exposure specific form for documenting exposure but rather follows one set form for all Workers Compensation cases. As overhead within the crew we noted a need to have better Situational Awareness to the presence of past dump sites (it was hard to identify it as being different from surrounding berms/pits typical of the agricultural area we were working in) and be able to make a plan to address critical holding concerns minimizing exposure and even alternate plans that reduce exposure. More than anything we need to make those adjustments sooner in the future.

This can also result in users walking on one another because they don’t always associate this static noise being a weak signal from a distant repeater on the same Net.  When dispatching resources to a smoke report, or reading daily weather VIA simulcast, users in a large geographic area in both Districts will experience heterodyning. <br/>o	Dispatch interference issues explained:  When users walk on one another dispatcher will hear garbled noise on the console.  Now users on either District could not pass information along to dispatch – resulting in a total loss of communication.<br/>o	Worst case scenario:  Firefighter on one District is in a fire shelter deployment scenario, the Dispatcher locks frequencies across the FS East Net by transmitting over that one repeater (if they do a simulcast users will hear heterodyning over a large geographical area) . Users on the other District did not receive that frequency lockup transmission - are currently only hearing static - and continue to use a different FS East repeater on their district.  Now the Dispatcher has to take their attention away from the crew that needs help to inform other field going personnel utilizing the same Net on their District to lock up that frequency.  They could theoretically have to do this a total of three times due to there being 3 base stations for the FS East Net.  Due to the complexity of this network design, you cannot expect incoming Dispatchers or current Dispatchers to understand how to communicate through this process.  <br/>•	Repeaters are too far apart and when multiple users use the FS East Net at the same time the voter is unable to pass usable audio to dispatchers – signal is garbled and unreadable that results in missed calls and introduces a major safety issue. <br/>•	The use of unreliable 4-wire teleco circuits – there have been 5 telco circuit failures in less than 1.5 years with varying telco company response times, one taking 4 days for rectification (Procedure for opening ticket with MetTel has differed each time).  This also introduces too many points of failure and makes troubleshooting more time consuming and results in longer downtimes.<br/>•	If you have a Base Station that begins developing issues (i.e. bad antenna), or sight noise - voter will not vote properly, because that base station may not see the stronger incoming signal, which will introduce a weak signal to the console. <br/>•	When bringing voter down for maintenance, this crashes the whole FS East Net<br/>•	This Forest has had a high Electronics Technician turn-over and has resulted in a radio network that has been pieced together with very little thought and has not been properly maintained to the point of major system degradation and failures.<br/>Recent Issues:<br/>•	June 3, 2018 the 416 fire was being handed off to the Type 2 team and the Incident was still utilizing the Missionary Repeater as their Command Repeater (FS East Net).  A lightning burst rolled through the east part of the zone and there were multiple single tree IA’s that completely bottle necked the FS East Net.  Crews were walking on one another from opposite Districts/Incidents and Dispatch was unable to effectively communicate with IA personnel on the Pagosa RD.  <br/><br/>Solutions:<br/>It can be expected for the San Juan National Forest and the CO-DRC zone to experience increased fire activity and complexity in the foreseeable future.

Approximate location was 63°55'32.9' N x 145°35'42.1' W (NAD83).  <br/><br/>We ceased ignitions in the vicinity and allowed the fire to burn until it extinguished naturally. I directed personnel to avoid the area, contacted DTA Range Control and requested the presence of a Range Inspector to investigate the scene, and I notified the AFS Military Zone Duty Officer.<br/><br/>No visual indicators of the detonation were witnessed. One worker reported feeling a concussive force in the chest and experienced tinnitus immediately following the detonation. He filed a CA-1 to report the injury. Two weeks later, the individual still complained of persistent discomfort (i.e., itching) in his ears.","We did not positively discover the source of the detonation, but the Range Inspector surmised from witness descriptions (i.e., louder than a .50 caliber blank, detonation within 30 seconds of ignition) that a previously fired, unexploded 40mm training round (“918”) was the most likely culprit. The only military munitions discovered in the area were several unfired, small-caliber (<.50 caliber) rounds and a fired 105mm projectile. Pieces of a small, destroyed beverage container were found in the vicinity.<br/><br/>Lesson learned and actions taken to mitigate risk have thus far included a redoubling of commitment:<br/><br/>- to implement the prescribed fire plan as soon after snowmelt as possible to minimize combustion residence time in vegetative fuels, which should in theory reduce the likelihood of detonation of any undiscovered UXO in proximity,<br/><br/>- to ensure effective UXO briefings for all implementation personnel tailored to each project area,<br/><br/>- to direct personnel to move away from ignited areas as expeditiously as possible, utilizing UTVs for ignition operations to facilitate expeditious departure, and<br/><br/>- to ensure strict adherence to PPE requirements, specifically hearing and eye protection. We added this PPE requirement to the Risk Management Worksheets for prescribed fire operations in the AFS Military Zone.<br/><br/><br/>This report was written by personnel in the Military Zone at Alaska Fire Service.","06/05/2018 10:40"

Incident was an evolving fire.  Fire had increased in size from an initial report of 600 acres when I received the assignment (1130) to a reported 6000 acres during my response (1900).<br/><br/>Weather was reported to me as approximate winds SW 20-25 with Gusts of 30; temp of >65 degrees; RHs of low teens to single digits.  Terrain was reported as broken with open ground, mesa tops, and steep slopes.  Fire Behavior was running, spotting, with single and group tree torching.  I was informed that an ICT5 was in command and that dispatch had no communication with the IC by either radio or cell phone and that communications were sketchy at best in that area.  Resources on scene were reported as various VFDs and a state T2 inmate crew and that there was no communication with those resources.  I was not in communication with the state , all communications were relayed to the state through dispatch.  Direct communication with the state was not established by myself or the state while I was the IC.<br/><br/>I called dispatch at approximately 1600 and requested an update on the fire condition and was told that the fire was approximately 3000 acres and that the fire had reportedly spread into neighboring states.  I requested the availability of a Type 2 team because the fire had spread to two additional GACCs.  At this point I believed that the complexity was exceeding my ability as a single resource without support.  Dispatch informed me that there were no T2 teams available but that a T2 short team might be available.  I discussed with the dispatcher that the fire was now in three GACCs and that coupled with a lack of organization and poor communication that the complexity would require a higher level of supervision and support.  Dispatch then contacted me and informed me that my request for a T2 short team and the T3 team had been denied by the State representative.  I then requested four DIVS, three Strike Teams of Engines, and asked for the availability of Type 1 crews.  My intent was to have resources that would have the ability to move around the fire and have adequate supervision to address LCES.  Also, to have resources that would be available for the next shift, instead of two days later.  I considered this a very basic order based on the updates I was receiving.  I, then, received notification from dispatch that my additional resources had been denied, also.  My next request was for a Airattack platform and Helitack Crew for the next day,  this request was filled by dispatch.  I requested a radio kit with handheld radios and a repeater to mitigate the communication issues.  I requested that dispatch make a log entry stating the condition of the fire, lack of communication, and denial of resource orders.  I believe that a lack of communication with the state representative prevented a clear picture of my intent with these orders.<br/><br/>At approximately 1900 I was informed by dispatch that the fire was approximately 6000 acres and had confirmation that the fire had spread to neighboring states.  Dispatch stated that the ICT5 had made a cell call to dispatch and given an update, but that there was no communication with the IC at the time.  resources on scene in neighboring states were unknown.  Dispatch informed me that my request for a communications kit was denied.  I requested that dispatch make a log entry, reiterating the status of the fire, lack of communications and qualified resources.<br/><br/>I arrived on scene at approximately 2030 at the local VFD station.  Made contact with the IC and returned to local town to meet with his supervisor, the FMO, at approximately 2200.  I had an extended conversation with the FMO about the fire and local resources, and history of the area.  At that meeting it was decided that the FMO would assume IC of the fire and that I would remain as the OSC, because of his local knowledge and relationships with the local departments and civilians.<br/><br/>These issues where on-going through the time I was assigned.  Some were mitigated, communications continued to be a critical problem and was not appropriately addressed or resolved.<br/><br/>Resulting Safety Issues:  Safety issues address concerns occurring while both the IC and OSC were on scene working together (3/9-12/18).  An appropriate level of LCES was never established while I was on the fire.  There was a complete lack of any effective ground based communications equipment on the incident.  Lack of command channel allowing for coordination of safety and resources.  Lack of effective equipment to establish tactical frequencies with resources.  VFDs would not check out radios to established tactical communications.<br/><br/>There was no Delegation of Authority for four days.  Resulting in confusion as to the ability to order support and suppression resources, or equipment.  Delegation of Authority arrived with the wrong name on it.<br/><br/>There was no state liaison assigned to the fire for four days.  Resource orders were consistently denied, without explanation.  No resources were available to assign to the north or east flanks of the fire, which continued to spread.  This created a large amount of unnecessary tension with neighboring states.<br/><br/>Lack of adequate supervision on the fireline for three days equal to incident complexity.  Complexity analysis were completed but not addressed by the hosting agency.<br/><br/>No IAPs were issued for four days because of a lack of support positions, printers, no established unified command with local resources, lack of a communications plan, and remoteness of that area.<br/><br/>State did not meet with local VFD chiefs to unify command.  Lack of red carded personnel within the VFDs was cited.  However that did not affect their daily engagement on the fire.  Lack of Red Cards is not a acceptable excuse for not engaging with small local resources in their areas of operations.","Determined that FMO would be IC to advance situational awareness.<br/><br/>Command channel was established through Airattack to communicate with dispatch and for emergency communications.<br/><br/>Retained state suppression resources on division Z working together to establish communications within those resources.<br/><br/>Recon flights to establish location of fire and resources threatened.<br/><br/>Ordered additional air resources for suppression operations of East and North flanks.","04/09/2018 11:14"

The potential of the incident was getting burned/fire weakened tree strike. The concern was that the two overhead personnel were not wearing all the proper PPE (hardhats, fire shelters, or full nomex).The prescribed burn was in timber under story with oak leaf litter and pine needle cast with heavy fuels scattered about. Total acres for the units was 90. The weather was cool, terrain was flat on ridge top, fire area had burning stump holes, fire weakened trees, 100 and 1000 hour fuels still smolding. The objective for the day was for fire crews to achieve 25 feet mop up of cold black up to 50 foot. The line where the overhead walked, the crews were still working mop up from the line to 25 foot. <br/> My concern was the burn area had fire weakened trees. The day before, it was reported on the radio that a couple of fire weakened trees had fallen to the ground and everybody needed to keep up situational awareness. Also, there were numerous stump holes still very hot and burning and the potential was high to step in one.","The actions I took to correct the problem was that I drove down to where they came out from the fire to there vehicle and I talked to both overhead personnel about wearing full PPE while on the fire line and walking through the fire. I talked about trees falling on them (green or fire weakened) and how the burn has been successful so far with no injuries or escape and I didn't want to deal with a medical incident/injury at this point of the prescribed fire.","02/27/2018 07:34"

Over recent years a trend has been emerging where it is becoming more common for resources to use blind transmissions in communicating to dispatch or other resources. A blind transmission, in telecommunications, is a transmission made without obtaining a receipt, or acknowledgment of reception, from the intended receiving station.   Example 'dispatch, engine 123 back in station and out of service'.  The resource then goes  home assuming the dispatch copied their transmission and put them out of service. The resource should have called dispatch and waited for acknowledgement that the transmission is ready to be received before stating they are back in station and out of service.<br/><br/>This has resulted in numerous occasions dispatch having to search for resources that have gone out of service for the day or not located where they were last acknowledged to be which can be crucial in an emergency.  <br/><br/>Blind transmissions are now being used by non-fire personnel who think it is okay to use as fire personnel are using this procedure.","It has been mentioned many times to Duty Officers and resources in the field both in person and on conference calls to use proper radio protocol however the culture that has been created is difficult to correct. <br/><br/>Leadership needs to acknowledge the lack of communication and inform their resources of proper communication protocol and what it is expected.","05/17/2018 14:42"

Testing has been taken during all weather conditions including high temperatures and humidity. It has been observed that course monitors are not following participants during test looking for distress in participants.The Florida Park Service is requiring this test for everyone that is involved in fire. Florida Park Service most of the time have inadequate training for these positions and are now being offered money to participate in each prescribed burn.

I have gathered this information from several other State Park employees, Volunteers, and other Agency employees. It is also my personal view. The problem is that the Florida Park Service is trying to correct actions from the past overnight. The Pack Test is an absolute necessary program for crew safety.

This prescribe fire was conducted in questionable management conditions. Unsafe conditions persisted throughout these two days of operations, primarily the second day. Examples of unsafe conditions were; resource availability, poor decision making from overhead, fire behavior conditions, and disregard for firefighter safety and well being. In the end, the prescribe fire resulted in going out of weather prescription while the ignition continued and finally, resulting in multiple spots ranging from a 1/10 acre to 3 acres. Firefighter safety as well as land resource benefits were compromised. I witnessed this prescribe fire project within a short period, and can not judge all the firefighting personnel on the Carson National Forest, but I have concluded that operational conditions are unsafe due to poor leadership skills. The poor leadership skills that is in question was exhibited is by the “Madera South Rx” Burn Boss, the Safety Officer, the Forest Fire Management to let the safety officer and burn boss be qualified and present, and the accountability of the Training Officer to ensure qualified fire staff are utilized. The questionable trained qualified fire staff reverts back to the Madera South Rx burn boss and safety officer who occupied these positions on this certain incident. The definition of a Safety Officer, according to the “Fireline Handbook, “The Safety Officer, a member of the Command Staff, is responsible for monitoring and assessing hazardous and unsafe situations and developing measures for assuring personnel safety. The Safety Officer will correct unsafe acts or conditions through the regular line of authority, although they (Safety Officer) may exercise emergency authority, to stop or prevent unsafe acts when immediate action is required.” This is what others and I observed. The morning of 11/07/2007, the burn boss conducted the morning briefing to all prescribe fire resources. Certain portions were not clear and understood by the fire personnel and overhead during the portion of the ignition procedures. This included the ignition specialists and holding boss, which seemed confused or unaware of certain tactics. Later on, it was determined, the day prior; a different procedure was discussed and agreed upon by all overhead for the second burn day. This did not follow through, resulting in fire personnel being displaced and used in other functions (i.e. holders to lighters). Originally, two firing teams were going to be utilized only, but a third team consisting of the Burn Boss, the Safety Officer and two other fire personnel on ATV’s were developed by the burn boss and the safety officer. During the burning operation, one burning team was to concentrate on burning out a portion of the prescribe burn from a ridge down to a constructed handline that was located off a preexisting road. The team never completed the task due to the firing operations that had commenced simultaneous down slope from team three. The third team made up of the Burn Boss, Safety Officer, and the two other firefighter personnel on ATV’s began to burn out the interior without the consent of the ignition specialist trainee or the team above them on the ridge. The third team’s fire started to torch out individual trees and began to make an up slope push creating a visibility problem (smoke) for the team above. After the ignition of the third team, the ignition specialist trainee requested that all firing would cease until all personnel from above can get to a safe location near the preexisting road near a drop point. This information was relayed over the radio numerous times to the third team, but went unheard or unwilling. At one time, the safety officer acknowledged the ignition specialist trainee by commeting, “stand-by”, and continued to fire his handheld firing devices. This was heard by numerous fire personnel and thought this was an act of insubordination to the ignition specialist trainee’s position. At the end of the day, an “AAR” was completed with all fire personnel with the exception of the Burn Boss and Safety Officer, whereabouts, unknown.","I view a safety officer as a highly recognized position that concentrates on recognizing safety issues and mitigating hazards. I saw, on this particular day, a safety officer's own agenda which included having some fun while exercising the title only. This Safety Officer should have been exercising his duty that is stated in the Fireline Handbook. The burn boss is also at fault for participating along with the safety officer and not following through with his obligations to the prescribe burn, his personnel, and his forest.

With so many, escape fires and firefighter injuries, lessons should be learned and not disregarded, such as this incident. As a firefighter community, we rely on safety officers to keep us out of harms way and stop unnecessary risks. On this day, everyone was a safety officer except the one that should have been! A thorough investigation needs to be done on these individual to remove them from their current qualification or at least have them reinitiate all their safety training needs to become a fully qualified Firefighter or Overhead Supervisor.    Having a After Action Review on this certain day to mitigate the problems was conducted. It went on to be inaffective due to non-participation of the Burn Boss and Safety Officer.","11/12/2007 00:00"

Contributing Factors Affecting Leadership, Decision Making

And Risk Assessment

RXB2 and SOF3 trainee, ineffectively or otherwise void of communicating with trainees or project personnel on critical tactical changes, (not discussed at formal briefings) and off-handedly and unexpectedly implemented those tactical changes during the execution phase of project.

Ignition Team 3 (included RXB2 and SOF3t)- Ignition patterns were greatly altered or added (of impulsive nature) outside the scope of objectives, discussions or not previously declared during any previous planning. Team 3’s unannounced, unplanned mass firing operation along entire western bottom third of burn unit, forced a FUTA ignition team to abort their planned firing operation, and eventually lead to a situation where a burnout/holding operation between DP 3 and DP 4 was required to hold fire within project boundaries.

The impression was given by RXB2 and SOF3 trainee to expedite the entirety of operations, specifically the firing operations. The SOF3t openly exhibited what can best be described as ‘target fixation behavior’ by which the expectation that all resources would progress beyond an operational safe margin.

RXB2 and SOF3 trainee on 3 known occasions sequestered other pre-assigned (subordinate agency personnel) to participate in ignition operations without going through chain of command or obtaining prior authorizations. Holding personnel at AAR’s in all instances expressed a sense of being pressured or felt compelled to accept those orders as all were members of the same agency and was at the request from host agency upper management personnel.

SOF3 trainee (member of Ignition Team 3) focused all efforts too closely aligned with the firing operations rather than the health and safety issues a Safety Officer is required and was observed by many conducting unsafe, illegal or unauthorized actions.

Examples include:

•	Doubling up with more than one person on ATVs

•	Using unapproved ATV mounted drip torches

•	Directly disobeying orders to “cease firing operations”

•	Reckless use of hand pistol firing devices

•	Absent during AARs

•	Initiate new and unplanned ignitions (firing patterns) without prior knowledge or consent from Ignition, Holding, or Burn Bosses.

Overall poor and failing performance from RXB2 and SOF3 trainee. Commonly shared concerns expressed by burn personnel during AAR’s include but not limited to:

•	Leave project site early - during active burning period 	Lack of adequate planning and prudent preparation

•	Not present or represented at daily AARs

•	No open communications or sharing of alternative planning

•	Poorly prepared for briefings

•	Deliberate disregard and negligent in following the order to cease firing.","It is of the general consensus, the RXB2 and SOF3t lack those skills and abilities necessary to conduct a safe and professional prescribed fire program. It shall not be tolerated by myself nor expected of anyone else to subject ourselves to such incompetence and as subordinates exposed to an unacceptable level of risk.

It is believed strongly that the situation these individuals have created should be investigated by their supervisor. It has been suggested the post project AAR lacked real problem-solving opportunities and an apparent complete and utter lack of any ownership by management in these wrong-doings by these parties has resulted in further deterioration of managements credibility to function as a safe and effective fire management organization.

Prior to this incident, both individuals were reportedly fully qualified RXB2s, any sense of the phrase 'corrective action' shall include at a minimum, the revocation of 'qualified' and demoted to trainee, and should remain so until which time 'they' come to terms with their deficiencies in prescribed fire program management and have demonstrated the capacity to carry out a safe and professional prescribed fire project as RXB2 trainees.

The RXB2 conducting this prescribed fire was reportedly using this project to maintain his position currency. The SOF3, was found not a qualified trainee, and was under the direction of the RXB2 during 'this' false representation of the highest degree.","01/13/2008 00:00"

We dispatched three engines with a total of 14 personnel. On October 23, late afternoon one of the engines (E-11) showed up in ROSS as pending and the personnel as demobed. When checking the documentation the E-11 had been unfilled by a person at OSC, instead of being reassigned. I contacted the dispatch office in California to try and figure out what had happened. I was advised that the engine had been reassigned to the Santiago Incident and that they were physically there.

I called dispatch on the Santiago Incident and was informed that Engine 11 was not there; according to ROSS the order was still pending. When I informed them that the engine was in fact at their incident, I was advised that it needed to be straightened out.

Later on October 23, I received the original order for a second time to be refilled for Engine 11 for the OSC October Support to fill in ROSS. E-11 was not straightened out and listed on the right incident until late on October 23.

On October 24, I received in ROSS Orders for the personnel on Engine 22. In checking the history on the Engine, the order had been unfilled by dispatch at OSC. I filled the orders for the personnel, but now if you check on the personnel in ROSS it does not show the personnel and equipment together. We can track the personnel on this one but not the equipment. If you look in ROSS at the original order it shows cancelled, as though the engine never went to California on OSC October Support.

In contacting the OSC October Support Incident office personnel (the personnel at Santiago Incident dispatch did understand and were concerned) and ROSS help desk I did not get any help. They did not seem to understand the importance of being able to track resources.

To me this is a serious safety issue. We could not track our personnel, and they were at an incident that was not aware they were even there. Had there been an emergency from their family or an incident involving them on the fire line in California, it would have caused un-necessary delays in tracking them.","One of the biggest issues that I noticed was attitudes. The people I talked to were very defensive and not open to listening to the concerns and solving the problems.

The Incident attitudes were that they knew what they were doing and weren’t interested in listening to the concerns.

The ROSS help desk’s attitude needs to be more open to really listen and try to understand the concerns, instead of saying “that can’t happen” or “they can’t change your order”, and “that’s not possible”, when it had already occurred.    The OSC October Support Incident, Santiago Incident, ROSS Help Desk and Northwest Coordination Center were all called and notified of the issues.

Consistent southern winds exposed the holding forces on the north (leeward) side of the unit to heavy smoke for the duration of the burn (nearly 10 hours). The wind and fire behavior produced numerous spot fires during the majority of the peak burn period. This resulted in a demanding workload for the holding forces that did not allow for crews to readily rotate out of the smoke. Contributing to the situation was a late start in beginning the burn that resulted in the more critical edges of the unit to be burned during the peak of the burn period. Windrows of fuel stacked on the green side of the line were also a significant factor. The slower pace due to the conditions also increased the duration of the operation to longer than anticipated.","The burn was most likely conducted within prescription--though perhaps near the upper limit of the wind component. The resulting problems in holding due to the fuel and weather conditions should prompt caution when a heavy reliance on computer models for fire behavior predictions overshadows sound fire-ground sense.

Concerns for smoke exposure, or provisions for mitigation, were not mentioned during the briefing for this incident. Target fixation on accomplishing the desired objective perhaps partly contributed to hazard of smoke exposure being overlooked. On this instance the Safety Officer’s concerns were too closely aligned to operational concerns rather than the potential health and safety issues. The major reason for having a designated safety officer in the ICS system is to maintain a perspective that can offer contrast if a situation of “group think” arises within the operational personnel.

The fact that the issue for smoke exposure failed to be mentioned also stems from a much larger cultural perspective of the industry as a whole that seldom places smoke exposure as a concern. The effects of smoke on both short and long term health has often been downgraded or neglected in wildfires in general. Long term exposures to smoke come to light however during fire seasons such as this year where, as with the large complexes in Idaho, where crews were camped for weeks under inversion conditions.

Smoke exposure is often a necessary condition during wildfires, and yet it is the only safety issue specifically mentioned in the Interagency “Red Book” under the prescribed fire chapter. This highlights the disjuncture between written policy and how operations are conducted on the ground day to day. With reference to prescribe fire specifically, it raises the question that if a difference exists in how we operate on prescribed fires where we control when we put the torch to the ground and the conditions under which we do such, as compared to wildfire emergency where values are threatened. Are budget concerns, research, and fuels objectives so important that there attainment is allowed to cloud sound judgment? Prescribed fire should be the instance where we demonstrate the best of our knowledge and implement the most prudent and efficient actions. If we can't get it right on the prescribed line how are we expected to perform on the fireline. Waiting for more favorable conditions, reducing fuel loadings, starting earlier, black-lining ahead of time, ensuring adequate personnel are present to allow for rotations out of the smoke are all tactics that could have greatly altered the aforementioned situation for the positive.

But it speaks to issues of leadership when it is relegated to the line firefighters at the lowest levels to point out concerns. In this situation many people had raised eyebrows about the conditions, but a can-do attitude is contagious. Machismo became a substitute for adequate planning and prudent preparation. Concerns for smoke were dismissed as something that comes as part of the job –the attitude that real firefighters eat smoke and chase spots. This incident is not an issue of negligence but rather it is an issue of the surrounding culture in which we operate.

Its the mark of leadership to know when to inspire sacrifice and towards what end goals; It is a demonstration of respect when concern for one's subordinates triumph the achievement of goals that are not critical.","10/20/2007 00:00"

A medical emergency was declared due to the nature of the report and the difficult terrain from which the individual would need to be extracted.

Line EMT’s and the STCR responded as did an adjacent EMT and Squad from a Hotshot Crew. While accessing the injured individual, the EMT’s came upon the remaining 2/3rds of the crew walking out of the division. The EMT instructed the crew, including at least one squad boss, to return to the line to assist in the location and evacuation of the injured individual. The crewmembers and squad boss failed to heed that request and continued to walk out.

The crew next came upon the STCR who also told them to return to the line to assist. After some hesitation some crewmembers did return with the STCR to assist.

The location and evacuation proceeded with the injured individual with the assistance of the present crewmembers and the squad of Hotshots. The individual was transported and treated at a nearby facility and released.

During an AAR on the situation it was discussed that the crewmembers and squad boss did not understand their role in the medivac of their crewboss. Also, that they did not initially heed the instructions of the responding EMTs. The overall assessment was that the medivac could have been compromised or delayed without the assistance of the squad from the Hotshot Crew.","The affected crew needs to ensure members fully understand the performance expectations of all crewmembers in all fireline situations.

The outward appearance is that in the absence of the crewboss (the injured individual) the remaining crew leadership (squad bosses) failed to heed the request of the EMT’s because they did not understand their role in the medivac.

Additionally, the crewmembers do not understand the requirements of a ground evacuation and did not recognize that the EMT was in charge of that operation.

The assigned EMT’s had been a part of morning briefing throughout the operation and medical protocols had been reviewed previously during operational briefings.    This situation and the initiation of a safenet was discussed with the Crewboss and the Crewboss / Representative of the affiliated crew. It was made clear that the intent of the discussion was to review what had occurred and what corrective actions would need to be addressed to prevent further occurrences. The Crewboss and Representative agreed that the actions of the crew were inappropriate, they also agreed that such breakdowns could have serious implications during fireline or emergency operations.

It was discussed that squad bosses must have the leadership capability and empowerment to direct crewmembers in the absence of a crewboss during emergency operations. Also squad bosses and crewmembers need to better understand the chain of command for emergencies (medivac operations).

It was recommended to the crewboss and representative that their crews train to understand the expectations for all fireline operations to the extent of their ability.

Also it is recommended that squad bosses and crew bosses obtain leadership training and work to more fully develop their leadership competencies and capabilities. These leadership skills will also be essential to reinforce crew cohesiveness and accountability.","09/17/2007 00:00"

The line was somewhat active still and that was a concern to me, so we continued down the line to get to the beginning of the hose lay and 2 CAL FIRE engines were running the lay. I observed the Forest Service firefighter going up the hill to get more hose and the engine guys and girls from CAL FIRE weren't going up. There was a concern that the CAL FIRE folks did not know how to run the lay, it had taken about 2 hrs, to put in the lay down hill and it was a simple gassner hose lay. The folks from Forest Service were going up and down for more hose , that made me concerned , so I asked the CAL FIRE folks what was going on,their response was 'Were running the lay, I need more hose'. I asked the nozzle guy what he was doing and he gave me an insubordinant attitude and the 6 or 7 folks with him had no idea what they were doing. The nozzle guy didn't want to let the nozzle go and he was burning time , I told him to let someone else take the nozzle and he said no I'm running the lay.

These companies have radios that have “passed” inspection by both the contract officer level and vehicle inspections. These radios are being “passed” because the individuals tasked with ensuring the contractor has radios and with inspecting the radios do not know what to look for or how to check the radios for narrowband compliance. To compound the problem, numerous Communications Unit Leaders (COML) and Incident Communications Technicians (COMT) have failed to recognize that the radios are not compliant with Federal requirements.

Northern Rockies did try to run inspections out of the Missoula area with a knowledgable technician checking for compliant radios.

One COML from NR actually seized the non-compliant radios to prevent them from being used. I do not know if this is a good or legal tactic.

The operator was operating a T250 Bobcat Skidsteer with rubber tracks and a Fecon head mastication attachment. He was moving from one area to another when he noticed flames over his left shoulder coming from the rear of the Bobcat in the area of the engine compartment. He lowered the Fecon head and attempted to remove it but the engine stalled. The operator radio'd for help, got out of the machine went around to the rear of the machine and attempted to open the engine compartment door. Difficulty was experienced opening the engine compartment door due to excessive heat and smoke in the area. Once the door had been successfully opened both operators attempted to throw dirt on the fully engulfed engine. Within a few seconds parts on the Bobcat started to explode and the operators gave up on the Bobcat due safety concerns and diverted their attention and energies on suppressing the brush fire. Dispatch was then notified of the situation and additional suppression forces where ordered. Within a few hours the brush fire was controlled. The following morning Intermountain Bobcat and the fleet manager were notified of the incident. The following day the fleet manager, the district fuels AFMO, a Bobcat technician and sales manager did an investigation of the fire. The equipment was so severly damaged that no conclusive evidence to the cause of the fire was found. Bobcat did make some recommendations which where implemented before work resumed.

The resulting safety issue is operator entrapment if the Fecon head was in such a position as to inhibit the operator from openning the Bobcat door. Bobcat was questioned as to whether the door can be kicked open and the answer was yes due to the weak hinges of the Bobcat door.","It was found that several loose wires to the immediate left of the battery could have worn through causing an arc which in turn could set debris located in the engine compartment on fire.

The local radio tech has made several trips to the remote repeaters with the most troublesome radio site being a four hour drive, one-way.

The radio tech 'makes adjustments' and orders new parts that take many days to arrive. In the meantime our fire communications suffer greatly. Our options are to place a human repeater in the local field office or as the tech suggests to “just use the admin frequencies until the parts arrive.' The admin option is a poor one because it’s already getting heavy use and it has fewer repeaters, less coverage and is not loaded as a fire frequency on cooperating agencies radios.

The quality of the radio system seems to vary according to the time of day with the middle of the day the best despite there being no solar panels in the system.

The radio tech is largely disengaged from the fire effort having alienated most of the fire managers and dispatchers. For example, after trips to repeater sites he has not passed along results of repairs or status of radio systems to FMO’s or dispatchers. They are let to discover for themselves the operational status of the radio systems.

We realize that the main contributing factor in this situation is a personnel/performance challenge however its creating a growing safety problem which unresolved will result in a communication related accident.

In the morning briefing, the Comm Unit Leader took a stern tone strictly forbidding crews from using their own internel 'crew net' frequncies for communication on the line. He went so far as to threaten legal action against those who continued to use crew nets.

This is a clear violation of the first thing we teach the newest new guys, LCES, and creates potential violations of Fire Orders 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9, all of which depend on timely communications.

With 20 people on a hand crew spread out over a long section of line, an internal crew net becomes critical for timely warnings, especially when the fire is making a run and we need to get our people out of there. Imagine a division with a dozer boss, a dozer, a strike team of engines, an STL, a TFL, and a few hand crews, and perhaps a safety officer, an EMT, and a FOBS- actually less people than on a typical day on the line on any given division. There may be more than 30 people using the tac channel for the division. On this very fire, I had to wait several minutes every time I needed to make contact with my crew because of the traffic on tac.

Imagine this: A spot fire has crossed the line below my crew and wind, slope, and rh have aligned to create potentially extreme fire behavior conditions. I need to warn them. Meanwhile, 2 miles away, the dozer boss is guiding the dozer on tac, the DIVS is waiting to pass a message to his STL, an engine crewman needs more pressure at the end of the hoselay, and a member of another hand crew needs the EMT right away for an injury.

The Comm Unit Leader on the WSA Complex required us to use the tac channel exclusively (Unless we are to ask for more water pressure on Air to Ground, and guide the dozer on Command...) I would not have been able to warn my crew, or to account for them properly if I could warn them, had this hypothetical spot fire occurred.

I was shocked that he forbade us from using our crew nets, and decided to go ahead and do so anyway for the safety of my crew, in order to maintain LCES at all times. But when we cloned at the Comm Unit, he had locked out an empty channel, simply to prevent us from using our own frequency. Thus, he not only required a violation of LCES, but he ENFORCED it with his actions.

Had there been a fatality on this fire, I would have made damn sure that the investigation needed to focus on the lack of Comms due to the Comm Unit Leader's need to micromanage. It is entirely possible that any incident on this fire could be traced directly back to his actions, and also possible that it culd have been prevented by a simple, timely warning on a crew net channel not crowded with traffic from 30 other people.","First of all, this Comm Unit Leader needs to be put in his place.

Next, not simply allowing, but requiring each crew to have it's own crew channel.

Giving this Comm Unit Leader a course in LCES and finding a way to get him out of the office once in awhile to see the reality of comms on the line. Reminding him that we depend of good comms out there, and crew nets are often an absolute necessity, and he is lucky that his actions have not landed him in front of an investigation team.    I was afraid to say anything on the fire becuase there is a deeply ingrained culture of discrimination against private contractors throughout the fire world, from the FFT2 at the local unit to Type I IMT's. Our ideas are not taken seriously and we are sometimes punished for speaking up. This could be a subject for another whole safenet; suffice to say that private sector firefighters are increasingly well-trained, politically savvy, and experienced, and the continued minimization of our input will hurt in the long run. Many of us have agency experience, excellent training, deeply believe in the mission, and work hard on our own leadership skills.

Due to the proximity to private lands there were numerous private citizens engaged in suppression actions on this incident.

When we arrived on the fire, we were unable to contact the IC, so we contacted the Safety Officer to let him know we were on scene and to get a fire assignment. We were sent to a portion of the fire that was burning actively in junipers near a structure. We were told that there were already a few rural engines and a liaison at the structure. When we tied into the personnel at the structure, we were asked to assist in a small burn out operation. We were going to burn off of a 2-track road that tied into some old black form a previous fire on one side and the black from the new fire that was not actively burning on the other side. The fuel was mostly grass and sage brush with a few scattered junipers. The wind was around 5-6 mph blowing towards the main fire. Other than an un-crossable wash in the middle of the 2-track, this appeared to be a text-book burn out operation with everything in our favor.

Because of the large wash, we separated the two engines on both sides of the wash and began burning in opposite directions form each other. After burning for a few minutes the wind shifted direction and was momentarily pushing the flames from our burnout, towards the 2-track road that we were burning off of. At this time I stopped burning to make sure the engine could hold it at the 2-track road. The wind then shifted back in the same direction that it had been blowing when we started, so we continued our burn for a short distance.

We noticed that the intensity of the main fire had had grown to extreme measures in just a few minutes and was burning in our direction. The extreme fire growth was due to the passing of a thunderstorm on the opposite side of the fire. Because the main fire was putting up an extreme amount of dark black smoke we were unable to see the thunderstorm coming. There was no announcement of this weather pattern on the radio.

A few seconds later we received a huge wind shift of approximately 30-40 mph winds pushing the main fire and our burn towards us. At this time I stopped burning and turned towards the engine to retreat from the heat and flames. After a couple of steps, a large fire whirl appeared right next to me and crossed the 2-track road where I was situated. The strong wind of the fire whirl blew the hard hat off of my head and forced me to turn around and run away from the engine. During my retreat from the fire whirl and the flames that were now on both sides of the 2-track, I lost my hand-held radio and was unable to attempt retrieval.

I was now separated from my engine by a wall of flame and was unable to contact them because my radio had been lost in the flames. I proceeded down the 2-track road with flames on both sides of me for approximately 150-200 yards before making it to a good dirt road and then the good black that we were going to tie our burn into. I had to wait for 15- 20 minutes before the smoke started to clear and the flame front had passed before I could try to find my engine to let them know I was okay.

I received a minor burn on my ear and one of my crew members received two burns on one of his arms that required some medical attention.","As far as a suggested corrective action, I think that the only thing that could have prevented this from happening is better communication. If we would have known about the passing thunder storm we wouldn't have been burning. This lack of communication isn't the fault of one or two people, any one on the fire that saw the storm coming should have made an announcement over the radio and as the burning crew we could have asked around on the radio to see if there were any thunder storms heading for the fire.    I have and will be giving a lessons learned talk to my co-workers to let them know that even if things look great and you task should be easy, conditions can change in just a matter of seconds and that you always need to be prepared for anything.","09/03/2007 00:00"

Garbled communications and lack of contact between units resulted. On the fire grounds, communications continued to be an issue with portable units unable to communicate with dispatch either through the direct channel or repeater. Distance between units during the incident was 1-4.5 miles. These have been ongoing issues at the refuge. During daily activity, it is an annoyance, but during a fire incident, it becomes critical. Efforts to solve these problems have been ongoing, however progress has been very slow and sporadic.

Development of the refuge radio system incorporates the use of multiple remotes that requires the use of older telephone lines to tie the system together. Four different sites on the refuge utilize a central antennae, which seems to make a complex system with lots of potential for problems.

Failure of the system to function properly causes frustration on the users part, insecurity of the user to trust the system, and creates risks and hazards for operations in the field. For an issue as important as this, progress in resolving the problem has been too slow and needs to be accelerated.

Communication is essential to the fire crew and the public's safety and well being. Not being able to communicate effectively jeopardizes the refuge and the resources it protects.","Since the refuge converted to the narrow-band radio system, several years ago, the radio system users experience frequent issues with communications with headquarters dispatch. Some problems are easily explained like loose cable connections, lack of adequate personnel available to man the dispatch, and user error, but other issues are more complex with the system going off line regularly, garbled conversations, two users within close proximity-(sight range) not able to communicate with hand-held units. The refuge has a staff person, who installed the majority of the system, but due to other duties is not always available to trouble shoot problems. There are also larger design issues with the system that even Motorola has had problems addressing.

The refuge is currently having a 3rd party radio contracor review the system and recommend solutions. Ultimately the refuge strives to have a maintaince agreement with a certified contractor, which will be responsible to address communication issues in the future.    Refuge staff has attempted to resolve the issues as time permits, however progress has been slow and at times seems to stall due to inadequate time and funds to address the problems. The 3rd party review will identify solutions and the refuge staff can budget and plan fixes for the problems. The maintaince agreement will ensure regular evaluation and maintaince of the radio system.

This SafeNet will emphasis the problem and the importance of resolving the issues in a prompt and timely manner.","08/28/2007 00:00"

We traveled from Monticello UT to Twin Falls ID that day. All of this travel was on state highways and freeways. On 08-13-07 we left Twin Falls in route to the Cow creek Fire. About one half of an hour after our travel started, the Engine jerked to the left as we heard a pop. The driver corrected the Engine keeping it in our lane as he said 'tire'. I then looked in the rear view mirror and saw part of the drive line bouncing down the highway behind us followed with a cloud of oil and smoke. We rolled to a stop on the shoulder of the road and shut down the Engine. The failure was in the high velocity joint in the front drive line. It bound up and snapped the drive line in half. It also broke the front pinion, smashed the exhaust and oil filter and cracked the transmission case. If the break were to have been in a different spot along the drive line it could have easily come through the floorboard and caused serious injuries to the crew. Our speed at the time of this breakdown was a maximum of 60 mph. I took the Engine in approximately 9,000 Miles ago and had this part replaced as it was recalled for this same reason. We conduct thorough inspections and document them every day. This part had shown no signs of fatigue or failure. In addition, we were not in four wheel drive at the time of the failure nor had we used it for some time. Some other problems that we have had with this Engine are as follows. The cooling fan came apart and destroyed the radiator. The cooling fan clutch air hose has been sheared off multiple times due to poor routing. I had it routed in a different way and that fixed the problem. The Transmission overheats quickly on hot days when climbing a grade. The Cam position sensor went out leaving us broke down along the highway and out of service for a few days.","This Engine in Particular has not had many problems compared to other Engines with the same Chassis. This last failure, however poses serious safety issues. I would recommend that we should seriously look at other vehicles to use for our heavy engines. I know that Ford, Chevrolet, Freightliner, Unimog and many other manufacturers make a truck that may suit our needs. In addition I think that Eleven years may be too long of a service life for the kind of work that we do with these vehicles.    I had the Engine towed to an International Mechanic for repairs. They have had others come in to work up other bids on the work to be done. They have told me that it will be somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000 dollars. This work, they tell me will take two to three months to complete.","08/23/2007 00:00"

I have read the Stay-In-Place Event Document and while it is acurate it does really paint quite a rosy picture. While the burn-by could have been much worse it also could have been handled much better. I had really never heard about the stay-in-place plan until it was announced over the PA at 1545. If this plan had been developed why were so many items left undone. The meadow as stated in the event document was large enough to safely hold people in place but everything was concentrated at the far western end of the meadow (where the fire was likely to impact from) where the meadow was the narrowest and the tree densities were the thickest. If camp had been moved to the far eastern edge of the meadow it would have allowed for more distance between the flaming front and ICP central. Additionally, if it was expected that ICP would be threatened why were personel allowed to set up camps and park vehicles in the timber that surrounded camp and why were trees not thinned that lined the south, west and north sides on camp. Sprinklers were in place but proved ineffective in most instance with many set to far out from camp to protect camp when the timber stringers that surrounded camp caught on fire.

While grasses in the meadow were beat down fairly heavily that did not stop spot fires from igniting. Anything and everything that could burn inside camp was catching fire from the ember wash. It was a combination of everyones efforts that saved camp from burning down. The caterer and shower facility employees had to work just as hard as firefighters to keep their equipement from burning to the ground.

My biggest concern is for the total disregard for the safety of support personnel in camp. Every incident management team says their number one priority is safety and I believe this team totally ignored that priority after August 13th. On the 14th the inversion did not lift until almost 1700 which left camp socked in for almost 24 hours. Once ICP had its burn by people in camp were forced to endure heavy smoke concentrations for another week until a new team came in and moved camp. Logistics drove the decisions to not move camp instead of safety. If you look at the medical records I'm sure they will show how many people had respiratory problems from being exposed to prolonged smoke. I for one will refuse any assignment with this incident management team in the future. My health is more important to me than any yurt.","Before I left for this assignment I looked it up on the Situation Report and it said that ICP was threatened. That was 10 days before ICP was 'burned by'.    I flled out a team evaluation form on the 14th and asked why camp was not being moved. As far as I know nothing was ever addressed.","08/29/2007 00:00"

It started on highway 24 and was pushed north by an 8MPH south wind. The east flank of the fire was going to run/flank into a gravel road, but direct mobile attack by the engines kept the flame front from reaching the road by 300 feet. The head of the fire was running through grass and heavy old growth sage brush to the north. The north end of the fire where the head was going was a mainline train track. The head of the fire died down as the fire ran out of fuel when it hit the tracks. The west flank of the fire ran into a marsh and died and was not a problem. If the head of the fire would have spotted over the train tracks, the spots would have landed in an irrigated field where the probability of ignition was very small. The problem with this fire was the public. As the head of the fire ran to the train tracks, the wind shifted to blow out of the south west. This pushed the fire into a corner of the road to the east and the train tracks to the north which made some impressive flame lengths before dieing down. Four private citizens in pick up trucks as well as three citizens on 4 wheelers blocked the road where the train tracks crossed the tracks. Although they probably weren't in trouble, when the fire's head hit the corner the citizens had a hard time getting organized to flee the area. This created confusion and near panic that could have led to problems. Every thing turned out OK, but if the fire would have spotted across the corner east and north of the train tracks and the gravelroad, the engines would have had a hard time accessing the new fire due to the citizens trying to turn around and scrambling to get away from the flame front. If a spot would have gotten established in the dry country north and east of the main fire, it would have had many sections of ground to run in. Just the number of citizens congesting the fire ground in that critical area could have caused problems on this fire, however, there were no bad consequences in this case.","Aside from the normal actions that one might take to mitigate the risk associated with citizens being present during critical times of initial attack ( Law Enforcement, road closures, Road Guards )I feel that a national awareness program ( at least for the states most affected by wildland fires ) could help. It seems to have worked for Smokey Bear and the big anti litter campaign of the 1960's and 70's.

Another idea is to get radios that can talk to local law enforcement to the IAIC's. We do not have this capability on our district. Law enforcement was on scene during the aforementioned incident, but they set up shop on the highway at the heel of the fire and had know way to get them without driving to their location or calling their dispatch and trying to get them moved that way.

Also, pre-season mutual aid drills and sand table excercises with the local law enforcement folks could be benneficial.    In this instance, I mentioned to one of the vehicles that this might not be a good place to sit and that they were not helping the cause. When the flames and roiling black smoke started getting close, they left on their own.

Due to the topography of the area, the repeater frequency was also used, when necessary for communications between crewmembers.

Attempts were made by personnel on the Tag Fire and the Long Tom Lookout to contact the crew from the other incident. Attempts were unsuccessful.

C should disengage. On my way out I passed three sets of flallers who wanted to know what to do. I suggested they follow me to a safe area. Falling boss Ferguson agreed and we began to convoy.

At the same time, TFL #2 was investigating the spot fire in the unburned island that engine 181 had reported. 181 had knocked the flames down so TFL #2 went past that spot fire unknowingly and arrived at a different spot fire that he described as fully engilfed. Had not TFL #2 come across this spot fire and called all the other engines, the escape route would have been cut off and all resources behind would have been in great peril. I arrived along the dozer line to find the road obstructed from this suppression activity. TFL #2 asked me for one load of water. I responded, 'Yes, you can have one load, but you must open this road so the fallers can get out.' He agreed.

He opened the road. I directed my EA to lead the fallers out with the dozer vehicles up to drop point 13. As my EA was leaving the fire we were approached by Div Sup. and were told to park his rig up above, get the crew and gear and then tie back in with him. Luckily my EA is not a rookie and understood that a full scale disengagement and evacuation of Div. C was under way. All resources were told to report to the heli-spot 15. After debriefing at H15 all resources were released from the incident to ICP.

Upon arriving at ICP I went immediately to the Incident Commander and explained what happened. He brought in two safety officers and I explained again what happened. I ended my conversation that I had no confidence in Div C except for TFL #2. I requested assignment on another fire or demobilization.","I believe if Div Sup. had set hard targets and had better situational awareness regarding the danger of the fuels along the UI as our escape route.

We had a fire near Mt. Bachelor where we could not communicate with the IC, except by cell phone. If the fire was located 5 miles from where it was, we would not have had cell phone coverage. This is an area we would normally have good radio coverage.

On 7/27, the floor supervisor called in to EUSIC with the problem and was issued ticket #2634562. Follow-up call revealed they had possibly traced the problem to a switch in Eugene. They did not plan to work on the problem until Monday.

The floor supervisor brought this to my attention. I called EUSIC to inform them their proposed timing was not acceptable. They said they would work on it.

On 7/28, it appeared that the problem may have been resolved. However by that afternoon it was apparent it was not. I called them again and was told it was an access problem, they could not get into the building the switch was in (Eugene Dispatch)I told them I could get them access to the building.

On 7/29 0800, they had a technician outside the federal building in Eugene. I called EIC, who let him into the building. They could not get him into the room where the switch was however. EIC arranged to get someone to open the room in the afternoon. They did a temporary fix. The final fix should take place on 7/30.

The safety issue is having communications with the fire(s), being able to pass on weather alerts or other critical information and receive information on fire behavior and critical needs.","The contract organizations need to be more reponsive/cognizant of the severity of radio communications problems to fire organizations.

When the Forest Dispatcher called to check the status of the fix on 7/27/2007 he was informed that it would take 2-4 working days (not weekends) before this is fixed. He told them that this was level one safety concern, and that did not change anything. The reason this is a safety problem is that the Fire Dispatch center is not able to place or receive phone calls. If we have a fire, we are not able to use our phones to make calls to fire personnel and get them responding to fires. We are also not able to receive fire reports or emergency notifications from the public. The dispatch center also is a hub for safety on the Forest, so without phones we are not able to properly serve our users if there is any kind of emergency. If we have a fire or an emergency, we will be hard pressed to provide safe communications. This is not the first time we have had problems with our phones this summer. On 7/3/2007 they went down. This caused numerous problems since they were unfunctionable over the holiday. This took almost a week to fix.

The time of day was approximately 1600. The speed limit for that road into Malta was 55 mph. I noticed my Engine was running hot but not over heating so I decreased my speed to 45 mph to allow for the engine to cool down.

At approximately 1610 I noticed what appeared to be a power line draped across the road right at eye level. I could not see it earlier because the shadows on the mountains in the back ground hid it from me. The first reaction I had was to hit the brakes. The brakes immediately locked up (the older engines are not equipped with anti-lock brakes) causing the engine to skid and drift towards the right shoulder of the road. As the engine continued to slide I held firm on the steering wheel not wanting to over correct because I thought that would cause the engine to tip over. The engine ended up getting pulled onto the shoulder and off the pavement. The next thought I had was to miss the up coming power pole on the right side of the engine. I inched the steering wheel to the left as gently as I could and missed the pole.

Finally the truck came to a rest just missing the power pole and the hanging power line. After gathering my thoughts for a few moments, I blocked the road off and contacted Raft River Electric and notified them off the problem. We remained at the site stopping and directing traffic until Raft River Electric arrived and fixed the line. It turns out the line was just a telephone line and probably would have broke if we had hit it. Had it been a power line (steel cable) I think it would have caused serious injuries or death to my self and my assistant. Speed was a definite factor, had I been traveling any faster I feel I would have rolled, like I said earlier I was traveling around 45mph on a 55mph road.","Factor #1

Staying focused on the task at hand which in this case was driving. Had I been distracted by things like the cell phone, radio, or FM radio I probably would have blown through line and not noticed. But if it had been a steel cable power line I would be lucky to still have my head.

Factor #2

Not over correcting when the engine was drifting on to the shoulder. Your natural reaction when you lose control of a vehicle is to jerk the wheel to correct it. Had I over corrected I feel the engine would have tipped for sure.

Factor #3

If the brakes become locked-up try pumping them to get them released    Pay more attention to power lines that cross the road. Don't assume that all lines are where they are supposed to be.","08/27/2007 00:00"

We were told approval had to come from the Forest since the sign kits are Forest property. Apparently this approval was denied by the Forest Administrative Officer and Safety Officer.

These sign kits were not available thru the cache system to be used on the Incident. This type of signing is available thru commercial sources but time constraints affected their availability and did not meet our needs.

We utilized local agency cautionary signs (slow, trucks) obtained from the Road Maintenance Shop as a means to mitigate the identified hazard. However, these signs do not meet standards for Incident Management Signing on a State Hwy.

Radio over IP still does not work on the whole Forest. At 1239 the dispatcher received a phone call from a Radio Tech assigned to the ISO but is stationed on the Forest, he asked them if they were having problems with the radios on the Forest, the dispatch office confirmed that radio communications were lost accross the Forest. At 1254 Dispatch received a phone call from Networking to discuss the situation with the radios, at 1310 the dispatcher placed a ticket # 2621842 with EUSC, it was placed in a Severity 1 Que. At 1332 the Dispatch received a call asking them to reboot the router, the router was rebooted with no change to the communication loss.

During this timeframe, the Forest was attempting to schedule a fire recon since the Forest has been experiencing lightning over the last 6 days, Jumper aircraft were over the Shoshone NF to the East and were planning to overflight the Forest on their return to West Yellowstone, Dispatch called Cody Dispatch to have them relay to the Jumper aircraft that the Forest did not have Radio communications with aircraft accross the Forest and for them to not complete the overflight of the Forest. Currently we have no ability to communicate with aircraft, so Forest Helicopters are sitting at the base and we are unable to conduct a fire recon. Ground Resources have limited ability to talk between themselves, but the south end is unable to contact TIDC, so a relay using cell phones would have to be established in the event a response to fire or accident is needed.

Although the agency is attempting to improve the performance of the servers, systems etc, the communications for fire, search and rescue and other Forest activities in the field is dependant on the IP equipment operating properly. When the equipment fails or there is other situations that affect the servers or routers and we lose our capabilities, there is a long timeline before communications is restored, even longer if the situation occurs after hours, weekends and holidays.

On 18 July, 2007 I was reassigned from the Black Pine fire near Malta, ID to the Rowland fire further west. I received my resource order and a map from South Central Idaho dispatch at the Black Pine ICP and departed for the Rowland fire just before 0900. The resource order gives the descriptive location as, “2 miles northeast of Rowland” and a Lat/Long of 41 56 56 N by 115 37 18 W. Following the map directions I drove up I 84 to the Hammett exit, through Bruneau on highway 51 and arrived at Grasmere, ID (a single inhabited structure) about 1330. I turned off the hard surface onto the dirt “Rowland Route Road” per map instructions. I drove the 47 miles to Rowland, NV (three unmarked, abandoned ranch structures in the bottom of the Bruneau river canyon) arriving about 1500. I did not see a single inhabited structure or other vehicle on this 1.5 hour drive, only the fire making runs to the north. There was only one trail leading north of Rowland that ended in a locked gate with ‘keep out’ signs. After an hour and a half driving up and down roads in all directions, I arrived on a two-track at the exact Lat/Long location. It was the cold heel of the fire, without another thing around (and it was in fact about 2 miles northeast of Rowland). The last cell coverage I had had was near Hammett (about one hundred road miles from where I sat). I climbed to the top of a hill with the Air-Ground frequency from the resource order punched into my radio, but could get no one to answer. At this point I was not lost (I knew how to get back to Grasmere), but I was totally unfamiliar with the country and roads, and I had no communications with anyone. I had no choice but to re-drive the narrow, winding roads back to Grasmere. Arriving about 1800, I ask the single resident of Grasmere if he had a phone I could use. No phone. Nearest land line was in Riddle, 19 miles south (if I was able to get there before the store closed). He said I was about the tenth one to ask about the fire ICP that day. There had been engines, a dozer on a transport and “the crew from Salem” (type 2 contract crew). On the way to Riddle, I came across an Air Force radar site and was able to get someone from South Central Idaho dispatch to give me directions around the fire through Twin Falls and to the Rowland ICP near Murphy Hot Springs (over 200 additional miles). After I left Grasmere, contract engines from Montana and the R&R type 2 crew arrived and unsuccessfully tried in the dark to negotiate the roads to the Rowland ICP. They ran into open fire on both sides of the road and had to turn back. That night the fire backed down and burned through the Bruneau canyon and around many of the roads I had been traveling.

I know this sounds like a lot of whining about wasted time. But to me it is more about safety, risk, and LCES. Had I disabled my vehicle near the heel of the fire, there is no telling when I might have been found. If any of the crews, dozers or engines had gotten disoriented and lost on unfamiliar roads and been cut off or burned over by a head of the fire, the consequences of a bad resource order location could have been tragic. This was the “C” in LCES: mis-communications that sent resources into desolate and dangerous country. And no-communications once we were there.","Administrative and dispatch personnel should remember the importance of good locations on resource orders.    Before leaving the fire, I discussed my concerns with South Central Idaho dispatch, with overhead at the Rowland ICP, and with the type one safety officer on the Murphy Complex.","08/01/2007 00:00"

At one point and time I heard him come across Madison repeater (Forest freq) tried to raise him on that as well with no luck. A recon/ATGS platform was in the area way south of the fire and advised me of fires to the west that were picking up, I then asked him to try to contact the airtanker and have him come over to primary A/G frequency. He did, and said that Dispatch (Pendleton Interagency Communication Center) had given him a bogus frequency. I quickly got him dropped then asked what the frequency was that they gave him. It turned out to be our secondary A/G. This was never relayed to the ground from Dispatch that the secondary A/G was going to be used. Later in the day we discovered that the secondary A/G is the same frequency as our Madison repeater TX frequency, thus a lot of bleed over on the command channel from A/G was happening. Through out the day our Command,Tactical, and air to ground channels were simply overwhelmed with radio traffic. The neighboring district was heavily involved in IA as well so our one tactical channel was simply no good, we walking all over each other, we switched to a secondary TAC for the Red Hill Fire, but on the Wall fire there was still the over use of channel 3 that really prevented us from effectively using resources.

Director, Fire Operations, R2","Geographic Area Fire Program Manager","1","Mid-Level Fire Program Mgrs.","Wildland;","Readiness/Preparedness;","Non-incident;","Human Factors;","Decision Making;Leadership;Risk Assessment;Fatigue;Performance;Situational Awareness;","","Through my own experience as a Manager for the past two years and through direct interaction with all of the R2 Forest FMOs and many Line Officers, it is my observation that agency imposed, administrative actions are now adversely impacting the workload of mid-level fire program managers. Additionally, organizational issues contribute to distraction of focus and add to the complexity of the fire management operating environment. Outlined below is an extensive list of these distractions.

Current agency initiatives, albeit well intended, continue to add to the complexity of an already complex and high risk operating environment. Individually and, more problematically, in a collective and cumulative sense, these self imposed agency actions represent significant, potential, causal factors leading to an incident-accident-injury-tragedy. These initiatives, adminstrative requirements and organizational transformations present mid-level fire program managers and line officers with additional distractions that are compromising their level of oversight, situational awareness, and ability to apply sound risk management.

Continued, competitive sourcing studies and associated data calls, transformation efforts, substandard support in business operations (and associated burden shift now consuming over 1/3 of FMO's time) distract employees and compromise their ability to safely and efficiently execute mission critical preparedness and suppression functions. Mid-level managers are overextended and their focus has shifted from doing the basics well to doing many things simultaneously and, often, in a substandard fashion.

The litany of initiatives, requirements, and organizational change is overwhelming. What follows is a listing of many, but not all of these potential causal factors:

1. Agency tranformation efforts;

2. Agency doctine;

3. Multiple FAM doctrines;

4. Pushing Fire Management Efficiencies out to the field before they are policy, adequately developed and in the middle of the fire season (LO certification WFDSS, AMR confusion, CPRs and RFRs, severity caps, etc.);

5. Revision of FSM/FSH 5100 fire and aviation management direction;

6. Conversion of standard rules of engagement to principles (e.g., 10/18, LCES in the 2007 Red Book) without engaging the Regional FAM directors...leading to surprise and confusion in the field (Chapter 1, Page 7, Paragraph 3);

7. Lack of understanding and compliance by the agency with OPM's requirmements and direction concerning implementation of IFPM;

8. Continued issues with performance of CHS and interaction with employees and the IMRB;

9. ASC continues to be 'in transition' with customer service deficits in the arena of personnel actions (i.e., hiring) and payments to cooperators/states;

10. Confusion about NIMO teams and their roles (filling out understructure);

11. Implementation of the National Response Plan (All Hazard/All Risk Doctrine) and mixed messages concerning all hazard responsibilities short of a Presidential Declaration;

12. Requirement that NIIMS be FEMA NIMS compliant;

13. Fallout from Thirty Mile (exposure to criminal liability);

14. Competitive sourcing studies (aviation, dispatch, training, others)

15. 2008 Budget Line Item changes ('wildland firefighters') and anticipated reduction in mid-level fire program manager staffing in the face of increasing administrative and oversight requirements and expectations;

16. OIG large fire cost study/recommendations (11/06)and resulting conflicts with State and local partners;

17. Incresasing volume of EEOC complaints and grievances flowing from many of these changes (e.g., Medical Standards, IFPM, etc).

18. The volume of required training getting pushed out through AgLearn during the fire season;

19. The increasing amount of preparatory work to bring on seasonal firefighters (AgLearn, finger printing, security training, IS-700, Medical Standards processing) not to mention time for basic fire training;

20. Threats to cut-off computer access;

21. Computer migration issues;

22. Continuing and incessant data calls;

23. Reviews upon reviews;

24. Doubling up of administrative (parallel and redundant) processes on Service First and other blended units;

25. New '10% Protection Exchange' initiative on Front Range;

26. Managing and reconciling multiple data bases;

27. Procurement capability or, lack thereof, amongst many firefighting modules reducing sustainability while on assignment (travel expenses) or conversely when issued a PCMS card, challenged with meeting monthly reconiliation requirements during an active fire season...at risk of losing their procurement authority;

28. Centralizing and increasing control at NMAC over the utilization of IMTs and crews... conflict between NMAC, GACCs and line officers;

29. Increasing Congressional oversight and inquiries;

30. Inability to satisfactorily maintain a radio system that functions as designed/intended;

31. Lack of qualified fire and other staff to deal with demands.

It is estimated that the administrative workload falling to these mid-level fire program managers is about 35% and rapidly escalating. This is similar to what the assessment by a FAST report in 2006 in R2 (J.Payne, June 2006). Historically, this workload has been less than 25% of their time. This growth is a function of the ever increasing demands (outlined above), loss of local administrative support, and continuing but incomplete transition to ASC. All this occurring in the face of agency transformation and presssure to reduce upper and mid-level fire management positions.

Failure to relieve this workload will/is reducing the level of situational awareness that these managers and line officers need to practice sound risk management. Indirectly, firefighter safety is compromised and at risk. Oversight and monitoring has become the exception rather than common practice. Quality assurance is diminished. The potential for failure to correct errors before they become serious is increasing.","1. 'Stop the presses' on any more initatives, data calls, competitive sourcing studies, additional mid-fire season requirements, etc.;

2. Roll back existing requirements now and defer until after the fire season is over;

3. Take the thirty-one items above and array them on a '215A' and work out some mitigation measures for hazard control... at a high level.

4. Add more capacity by appropriately staffing more administrative support personnel at the Unit level.

5. Add more radio technicians;

6. Streamline and/or eliminate redundant, duplicative, or 'no value added' process requirements.

The perception in the field is that the agency and its leadership have lost their way... pick your metaphor: 'the emperor has no clothes', the 'lemmings are headed for the cliff' at a high rate of speed, 'spinning out of control', lots of 'commotion',.... devise your own...

It appears to many that things are out of control and there is little opportunity to get it back.    Mutiple briefing papers over the past several years, including sharing/raising these issues and concerns with all four levels of the organization.

Advising LOs and FMOs to maintain their focus.

Advising all to focus on what they can control and letting the rest go... The problem with this advice is that there is so much beyond the managers control and yet, what is beyond their control, they have to live with and all of it has an adverse affect on what little over which they do have control.","07/12/2007 00:00"

The aircraft dispatcher attempted to reach her on Apache Greens direct, on Greens repeater off South Mountain and on National Flight Following - no contact. The Sitgreaves IA dispatcher, tried to get her on Sim-Select - Sitgreaves Greens and Apache Greens - no contact. I called Silver City Dispatch (NM-SDC)and talked to the aircraft dispatcher. I asked and he said J-43 was going to Payson to pick up a jumper(s)and returning. The dispatcher said he was tracking her on AFF. I said we had heard her call us a few times and were not able to reach her. The aircraft dispatcher and I then did a radio check on National Flight Following about 1202. Silver City came in loud and clear over our dispatch radios. He said he could only hear me break a squelch when I called him on National.

At approximately 4:25 PM, the USFS Ino Repeater was taken offline by a limb knocking down the powerline that supplies power to the repeater. This repeater is the only repeater that services the north portion of the West Zone fire protection area. With this repeater not working there was no radio communication with Dispatch or any other part of the West Zone. Cell phone coverage is patchy and not 100% reliable in this area.

Just when the repeater went offline there were multiple wildfire incidents ongoing on neighboring juristictions as well as a report of heavy smoke coming from the general area of a 3 day old prescribed burn that was in patrol status on USFS lands.

Communication with Dispatch and other resources were severly hampered and even though mitigation measures were immeadiately put in place this safety concern of repeater communications had a very high potential to contribute to major safety problems of no communication link with other resources beyond point to point radio range. That link to the 'outside world' is paramount when dealing with multiple incidents ongoing as well as more large consequence incidents in the process of developing.

Unfortunatly, this is not the only time this exact problem has happened with this repeater. This exact scenario unfolded less than 10 years prior on a 300 acre plus wildfire with high potential and high concequence. The fire was actually started by the powerline supplying power to the repeater being severed during a similar wind event.","Possible prevention of this problem would possibly be an alternative or back up power supply to the repeater. Also, putting up a second repeater in the Northern portion of the West Zone would give more than one repeater option if one should fail for any reason.    This problem was mitigated by tring to get the word out that the repeater was not working. People were in place at the office to relay via landline any messages from the field. This was effective for operations that could talk to the office on the radio via point to point frequencies. The power company was notified immeadiately; however, due to the large volume of work and other priorities the powerline was not fixed until late the next afternoon.","10/05/2007 00:00"

We're able to hand program our VERTEX hand helds but not mobile or use a programed King radio or be given a radio from the incident ready to use and enough radios for the crew so they are not without commincations.

Keep doing Safenet on this matter till it gets resolved.","08/07/2007 00:00"

Operations occurred during night and resources were very limited due to significant structure protection occurring elsewhere on the fire. Fire behavior was extreme with over 40,000 acres burned within a 12 hour period. I discussed our options with the IC and we decided to attempt direct tactics up to a certain time-set trigger point, at which time we would re-evaluate our success and consider an indirect strategy. The indirect strategy involved backfiring from a main road for several miles to contain the fire.

When I arrived on scene there were two resource advisors and two privately owned and operated tractors with disks, and no other resources. Each resource advisor was assigned to communicate with a single tractor operator. After some time one of the resource advisors became aware of about 12 ranchers working the line with shovels, up to that point no one knew they were out there. We asked them to please leave the line since they had no PPE, were not having any effect on suppression, and were limiting our options for burning out/backfiring. The ranchers refused to leave.

Law enforcement was preoccupied with a highway closure, evacuations and other higher priorities

The ranchers' refusal to leave the area raised two safety issues:

1. It created a potential for an entrapment if we had proceeded with a burnout operation. This could have happened if our resource advisor had not discovered the private citizens out on the line in the middle of the night.

2. It altered our supression strategies by eliminating an indirect option. This limited our options to direct tactics which put engine crews in a more hazardous situation on a fire with extreme fire behavior.","Not allowing private citizens to perform supression actions on public lands when they are not red-carded , have no PPE, and have no communications with overhead.

As fire report was being issued to COIDC I was in the fire warehouse and was recieving no radio transmission, The warehouse is equipped with a mobile/base radio wired to loudspeakers outside of building as well as inside, and is wired to external antenea that is mounted above roof peak. I walked to my truck in parking lot and turned on my handheld which was recieving a broken transmission. I returned to office and turned off Handheld and office radio was silent. Handheld was turned back on and was recieving broken transmissions. Hand held is KING Other Radios are Vertex???????

In the recent past our repeaters were linked, Wolf Mt, Pisgah, Round Mt, and Aldrich. This allowed for communication over a large part of Central/Eastern Oregon. Currently I am getting erratic intermittant reception from Wolf Mt and no reception from transmissions through Round or Aldrich. Transmissions from Pisgah do create squelch but are just noise. Radio test was just completed with me on telephone to other users while scanning these repeaters as they transmitted test calls.

With this type of problem the ability to engage in suppression operations is severly compromised. Response times could be increased, as well as ability to develop and maintain situational awareness in our response area which includes four seperate stations and 1 million plus acres of high frequency fire ground where multiple starts are not uncommon and communication and flexibility between stations is critical to safe operations.

Following the crash of the system we lost our WildCad dispatching system. This system is an integral part in effectively and safely dispatching resources to wildland fires. The program is designed to locate the fire using a mapping system, log resource action, and dispatch the appropriate forces to the fire. Following the crash we experienced a lightning storm which started numerous fires. We were forced to use paper logs to track resources during this time. One of the key features of WildCad is that all dispatchers are able to access the same information. The loss of the program also meant we were missing a key commmunication link within the dispatch system. One of the incidents turned into a Type 2 fire which required multiple resources and multiple dispatchers communicating with each other. The loss of WildCad limited our abilty to effectively dispatch resources to the fire. The loss of WildCad also limited the effciency of our aircraft dispatcher. The lack of WildCad has prevented her from converting latitudes and longitudes, tracking air resources, and has slowed the acquisition and implementation of air resources to our fires. We have dealt with the non functioning system for over a week dealing with multiple fires during this time. The system has been brought up but is extremely slow, ie 5-10 loading the map and crashing numerous time during a operational period. We continue to bring the issue to the IT department with little to no support or answers of when or if the problem will be fixed. Again, if we can't pull up the map we can't pull the resources to respond. Which could also have an affect on our firefighting resources. I believe we are losing Situational Awareness, as we have gone back in time to logging everything on paper and have lost real time communication with the dispatchers. I have been told by our IT lead that she doesn't know what the problem is or how to fix it. To me that is unacceptable. If she cannot solve the problem then we would hope the district would find someone that can. The biggest issue is that no one seems to care or is making it priority to get our system back up and running properly. I am not sure where else to turn to try and get this problem fixed. Concerned in Boise.","Getting someone in to take a look at our computer system and figure out what is wrong, what happened to make our WildCad program run so slow, or shut down all the time with runtime errors.    I have brought the issue up to the AFMO's & FMO who have tried to have our IT department rectify the issues with the system. They have brought it to the District Manager level and as to date, nothing has been resolved. I am not sure that individuals at the district level understand the impact this has on effectively running an interagency dispatch center.

Specific issues include excessive noise in the dispatch office while talking with them on the radio. Telephones, conversations, and other background noise occurred during nearly every transmission with this dispatch office. The level of background noise was such that it interfered with critical information exchange and asked radioing units to “turn up your volume,” or “get to another location.” Often, multiple calls to reach dispatch were attempted with no response. Local resource have grown accustomed to this communication breakdown, and frequently preempt their one-sided conversations with 'in the blind.'

In addition, a narrow/wideband conflict may exist on the 'La Mosca' repeater. This is evidenced by the fact that radio volumes consistently had to be turned down when traffic occurred on this frequency. This is consistent with a wideband frequency received by a narrow banded radio. When radio traffic occurred on local, direct, narrow-banded frequencies, radio volumes were then below audible levels. Local fire staff commented that the potential bandwidth issue had been identified but never corrected.

We voiced our concerns to local El Malpais staff, and while they agreed with our concerns, they have grown totally accustomed to the poor communications with ALBQ, to the point that they are no longer concerned with the issues. These problems have been 'normalized'- the level of importance has been lost due to the attitude that 'this is the way it is, get used to it.'

In addition, El Malpais staff encouraged us to focus on other issues besides these specific communications problems. This is contrary to the importance of communications which we remind ourselves of constantly- LCES, Fire Orders, Watchout Situations, Communication responsibilities, etc. This lack of attention to the basics is a failure of leadership at various levels.","Corrective action: ALBQ dispatchers need to be reminded of the significance of radio communications and their holy responsibility to the men and women engaged in wildland fire management activities. Dispatchers need to pay attention- a life threatening emergency could occur at anytime!!

The “La Mosca” repeater and all links (microwave, phone, etc.) need to be examined to determine conclusively that no wide/narrow banding issues exist.

Additional repeater sites may need to be added to the radio network in this area.

The volume of the “La Mosca” repeater in the ALBQ dispatch office needs to be turned way up, and the sensitivity of the microphone console should be lowered. Also consider turning down the volume of telephones, televisions and other background noise in the vicinity of this console.

Finally, we should encourage area personnel to change their attitudes about the performance of this repeater and the ALBQ dispatch office. These problems need to be fixed. These problems can be fixed, and until they are fixed, area staff should continue to pursue corrective actions.

Three repeaters were used for the majority of the fire traffic. These repeaters are solar powered and become unusable overnight until later in the morning resulting in the delaying of fire operations in the morning when it is safest to fight fire. Helicopter 99D often had to resort to on the ground flight following by the helitack crew because they could not receive Phoenix Dispatch. In the event of an accident, this would result in a delayed response as dispatch would still have to be contacted in order to initiate any action. A specific example follows: July 4 – at 0800, 99D was receiving Phoenix Dispatch very weakly. At 1000, 99D was unable to receive Dispatch on Hilltop or Turnbull repeaters. As well, oftentimes ground resources had to make repeated attempts to reach Dispatch even when they were able to hit the repeaters. Inadequate staffing at Phoenix Dispatch may be contributing to this particular problem.

Before arriving at the fire a weather forecast was given which called for a large thunder and lighting storms to be in the area within 30 min and another storm system arriving soon after. With thunder in the air, firefighter voiced concerns and were instructed to report to the area anyway. The area is a steep slop with large rock cliffs. The storm system passed without any rain.

On the first night a park division chief who was presumed to be the IC but never established himself as so. Decided the fire was contained after a few hrs and left the park to attend a Boy Scout meeting leaving two type II firefighters to monitor the fire. Later that night he called the fire contained. The next day the fire had burned outside the “contained area” and was left to burn. After two days passed firefighters were again instructed to put the fire out. With no supervision

There was no briefing given on any of the days this fire was active. Or an incident action plan established.

There was no command structure, no one would take incident command.

As I understand it there was no one qualified to be the incident commanded for an extended attack fire, ie. IC type IV.

There has been no after action review.

Although this fire was small and no one was injured, the outcome could have been very different. This is the second fire this season where the incident command system was not followed. The park division chief is reckless and over aggressive when it comes to fire. He was “pushed through” to get his qualification, which I question the legitimacy of.

We are a blended fire management unit. Central Oregon Fire Management Services, COFMS, comprised of the Deschutes and Ochoco National Forests and the Prineville District of the BLM. Our dispatch office, Central Oregon Interagency Dispatch Center, COIDC, handles all of the incidents for COFMS and the Sisters and Prineville Units of the Oregon Dept. of Forestry. COIDC uses repeaters from FS, BLM and ODF to communicate with the field depending on the geographic location of the field unit. Our ranger district offices, guard stations, forest headquarters, smokejumper headquarters, air tanker base and various visitor centers all have FS, BLM and ODF radio repeater capabilities.

Here is a situation that has come up at one ranger station office but is happening at numerous locations inside of COFMS:

A district AFMO called today and explained the situation to me. He said the mobile radio his district office used to have as a local base station for controlling the repeaters of the old radio system was removed by IRM. It was replaced with a console which obtains its connection to the radio system through the IP network. Radio Over Internet Protocal.

The old mobile radio, operating as a base station, was equipped with more than just Forest Service frequencies. It was also programmed with frequencies for the other agencies that make up our blended fire organization (COFMS - USDI Bureau of Land Management, USDA Forest Service, and the Oregon State Department of Forestry), as well as several other interspersed fire district organizations they jointly respond with.

The new console is equipped only with the Forest Service radio channels, so he has completely lost the capability to communicate on the other agencies' radio systems from his office. This communication is a requirement of his position, since they are a multi-agency fire organization and he must direct his subordinates in locations other than on Forest Service lands, where the other agencies' radio systems are more appropriate to use because of a field units' geographic location.

The loss of the ability to operate the other agencies' radio systems placed him in a critical situation. He was able to temporarily rectify the situation by having one of the other agencies install one of their own mobile radios where the Forest Service radio used to be located. He is hoping they will allow him to continue using their radio until a permanent solution is implemented. His preferred solution is the reinstallation of a multichannel local base station in his office.

His situation is not be unique. The other field offices of the Deschutes and Ochoco N.F.s where multi-agency fire personnel are stationed, are suffering the same situation as the new “Forest Service only” consoles are installed and the old multichannel base stations are removed.

Central Oregon Agency Administrators have in place many mutual aid agreements which commit FS, BLM and ODF resources to each other’s incidents as well as to city, county, protection association and rural fire dept. incidents. With the new FS consoles installed, FS District Duty Officers cannot communicate and monitor incidents within their geographic area unless a FS frequency is used. Central Oregon has good radio coverage, but it is a result of multi-agency repeaters being able to be used by all of the agencies. The mutual aid agreements are compromised and response time increased because the previous multi-channel/multi-agency/multi-frequency radios have been uninstalled and replaced with Radio Over IP consoles with FS frequencies only.","The Solution

The return to multi-channel/multi-agency/multi-frequency radios is the solution.

Ramifications of not going back to multi-channel/multi-agency/multi-frequency radios.

By installing FS only frequency compatatible radios our fire management communication capabilities has stepped back into the 'pre-interagency' cooperation era.

Duty Officers cannot talk to their subordinates and cooperator field units from their office unless the field unit is in a FS frequency area.","07/06/2007 00:00"

In conversation with the Forest FMO and the District Ranger it was agreed that the seriousness and potential risk to firefighter safety warranted that the crew be made unavailable for fire assignment until the incident could be investigated and appropriate actions taken.","A need for better situational awareness. There was very little traffic on the interstate at that time of day and the interstate runs at a downhill grade for several miles. The passengers were asleep and the driver was unaware that he had exceeded the speed limit. Crew drivers had reviewed a driving JHA and received a safety briefing prior to the trip. The desire to get home, the light traffic and a sense of mission completion seemed to contribute to inattention and complacency on the part of the driver. The individual in the passenger seat was also unaware of the excessive speed. I would recommend that while in travel status that vehicles travel in convoy as much as possible, that both driver and passengers need to remain attentive and that all agency driving policies, as well and State and Federal driving laws be strictly adhered to.    The crew has been held down until the incident can be discussed and an a mitigation agreed to.

The Forest FMO, the District Ranger and the crew superintendent met on 6/19/2007 with the crew to discuss the incident and to resolve concerns.

May 30, 2007

Zion National Park and Surrounding BLM lands

Summary:

The location of the primer pump and its lack of adequate mounting caused a complete failure in the rear brake line of E-611 Type 6 (S&S package, 2007 model) and impacted the brake line of a second type 6 engine (E-612) of same make, year and model.

Narrative:

On April 2, 2007 Zion National Park received two S&S Fire Apparatus light engines at the plant in Fairmont, IN. The engines had less than 100 miles respectively. After a thorough inspection possession was taken of the engines and they were driven back to Southwestern Utah. Over the course of the next seven weeks the engines saw light to moderate “pre-season” duty, with little off-road time and only one fire responded to by both engines.

On May 30, 2007 at approximately 1600 hrs, on a major hard pack dirt road traversing Gooseberry Mesa, E-611 lost its brake pressure and was immediately parked. Upon cursory inspection the primer pump had rattled off its top bracket mounting bolt and collapsed down onto the rear axle, severing the rear brake line. The engine was drained and towed back to station.

Upon return crewmembers immediately inspected the second engine (E-612) and found that it too had lost its top bolt mounting the primer pump and it too was resting on the rear axle and brake line. The second primer pump had yet to sever the brake line but damage had occurred.

The 12 V oil-less priming pump manufactured by Hale Products, Inc., weighs approximately 32 lbs. It mounts on two bolts, located on a far end of the pump. Due to its location directly above the rear axle (approx. 2” of clearance) and its inadequate mounting system (two short bolts, no locking washers), when the engine traverses rough terrain the rear axle travels up and impacts the bottom of the primer pump. This quickly loosened the already inadequate mounting system. The location of the brake line was in the middle of the impact area.

Numerous photos of the mounting system and resultant damage are available.","Both engines will have brake lines replaced and the primer pumps will be moved to a safer location. Any duty station with 2007 model S&S package Type 6 engines should check the primer pump location and consider remounting the primer pump elsewhere. The bolts are short and inadequate to secure the primer pump. After less than 3000 miles both pumps had lost their top bolts. 2' of clearance is inadequate considering the amount of travel in the rear axle during operation of the engine.    S&S Fire Apparatus was immediately contacted, as were duty stations known to have purchased Type 6 S&S Engines in the spring of 2007. Ford Motor Company was contacted for new brake lines and they are en route for replacement. E-611 is out of service until the brake line can be replaced and a new primer pump is procured and relocated. The primer pump for E-612 was removed to prevent further damage to the engine and a hand primer pump is being used.

In the future any company manufacturing post market pump and body packages is encouraged to give due consideration to where all equipment is mounted. The method for mounting the 32 lb primer pump was inadequate. The location was also inadequate and compromised the safety of the crew and the engine. All crews using these packages are encouraged to inspect the primer pump mounting system and consider moving it away from the rear brake line and axle and reinforce the mounting system so that it can adequately and safely hold the primer pump.","05/31/2007 00:00"

Hood National Forest, and Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area mountain tops. In the past there has been a manageable level of frequency bleed-over between these units. However, past bleed-over incidents were strictly associated with COFMS recon flights and the odd occasion when COFMS resources were passing over or staged atop a one of the higher Mt. tops in Central Oregon.

This year, for unexplained reasons, the problem has intensified. It first came to light in early May when the Battalion Chief at the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area heard COFMS Prairie Division Chief transmitting from the vicinity of Big Summit Prairie. Being familiar with the Big Summit area and understanding what a relatively low elevation COFMS Prairie Div Chief was at, the Battalion Chief called the Div Chief on his cell to discuus the bleed-over. The two agreed to raise the question through their respective channels.

They spoke with their respective dispatch offices and while likewise frustrated with the situation the response from dispatch was that there was nothing that they could do about it from their end and that the concern needed to go through IRM/IT. The COFMS Prairie Div Chief raised the question with IRM/IT and got little or no response.

On June 2, hearing a significant inncrease in COFMS bleed-over (primarily Pisgha Lookout) the Battalion Chief again contacted the Division Chief. June 2, was the first day the lookout had been staffed and the bleed-over included crystal clear communications between resources on the ground as the lookout talked them into lightning fires.

At length the Chiefs discussed the issue and agreed that the situation is untenable. Were COFMS and the Gorge, or the Mt. Hood to have simultaious incidents the bleed-over would pose a clear and present threat to the safety of those firefighters actively engaged in the suppression effort.

Bottom line, the bleed-over has already been an issue and it's just the first of June.","Directional antennas?

At this point in time there would only be squelch coming through the speaker monitor. The display reads 95 then the scan symbol and then 15. To remedy this one must switch the channel up then back down to the original channel.

I wish this was an isolated incident but it is not!

In order to be able to move hitches between vehicles and to allow different height hitches to be used, these receiver hitches have a large pin that holds the receiver insert in the hitch. In turn these pins have a retention pin to prevent them from slipping out. In most cases the retention pin is a spring type cotter pin. In some instances the large pin has a retention device fastened with a hinge mechanism to the end of the pin . This device is a flap with a hinge. While traveling the flap can be bounced into the unlock position and allow the pin to work itself out.

Here is a photo of the style pin that failed.

Once the pin worked out the receiver insert separated form the receiver hitch. The load on the trailer caused the trailer to tip backward. In so doing the two rear tires (this was a tandem axle trailer) blew out. As the tires blew out it caused the towing vehicle to handle erratically. The rear deck of the trailer dug into the roadway, bringing the trailer and towing vehicle to a stop. The trailer and its load and the towing vehicle were all within the Combined Gross Vehicle Weight Rating. The operator of the towing vehicle was one of our more experienced drivers and has a Class A CDL.

There were no injuries.

Damage to equipment:

Along with the two blown tires the two tires on the front axle were damaged and were replaced.

All rims were inspected and replaced if needed.

There was no structural damage to the trailer or the towing vehicle.","Lessons Learned

The safety chains worked.

The brake safety cable that applies the trailer brake in the event of a breakaway was too long to activate the trailer brakes. Since the rear of the trailer dug into the roadway, stopping the trailer and towing vehicle, this had no effect on the outcome.

The towing vehicle was a fully loaded 300 gal Model 52 fire engine on a F-550 chassis with a 15,000 lb GVW. Had this been an unloaded nominal 3/4 ton vehicle the trailer would most likely have overpowered the towing vehicle and could have caused the towing vehicle to go into the ditch or roll over.

Remedial Actions:

All receiver hitches of our fleet were inspected. The towing vehicle involved in this accident was the only one to have this style of retention pin.

All persons that will be driving tow vehicles will receive training on how short to make the break away brake safety switch to be effective.

When utilizing receiver hitches to tow trailers ensure that towing vehicle has enough weight to maintain control in the even of a hitch separation. This does not apply to trailers and towing vehicles that are 5th Wheel hitches.

The firefighter was igniting a prescribed fire in Fuel Model 3/1 with a drip torch while driving. The firefighter was using the ATV to widen blackline to secure the perimeter. The terrain was rolling and the surface was very dry. He was traveling at a very low speed (2-3 mph) straight down a 25% slope when the right front wheel of his Honda 4-wheel ATV bumped into a large ant hill which was hidden by the tall grass. This caused the ATV to tip over onto its side. As the operator stepped free from the machine, he inadvertently dripped fuel igniting the grass around him. He immediately radioed for help from the Burn Boss who was 150 feet away in a larger ATV (Polaris UTV) carrying a 70 gallon water tank. The Burn Boss arrived 1-2 minutes after the call, and moved his ATV into the black next to the tipped ATV where the two firefighters began suppression on the Honda and the surrounding grass fire. The plastic fenders, faring and the seat were ignited on the Honda but there was no evidence that there was any gasoline fueling the fire. There was a fire extinguisher on each of the ATVs and these were both discharged to ensure the ATV fire was completely extinguished. The Honda was then pushed upright. At this time, a third firefighter arrived with a third fire extinguisher taken from his nearby Type 6 Engine and this extinguisher was discharged to further ensure the ATV fire was out. The Polaris UTV was then used to pull the Honda from the incident site through 200 feet of black to the fire perimeter. The BLM employee has a current ATV Operators License and was observed by the Burn Boss earlier in the day to be very competent on this machine.","1) Consider walking to ignite area with drip torch rather than ATV, however due to advancing fire towards perimeter in this instance the ATV was used to expedite the widening of the blackline and it was believed we could get the firefighter back safely.

2) Use of ATV mounted torch would allow for two hands on the handlebars.

3) Scout ATV route prior to igniting with torch.

4) The ATV involved in this incident had 10 gallons of water on the front rack and the slosh from this water may have been a contributing factor to the ATV tipping over.    1)Water tank on the ATV will be removed and replaced with a 5-gallon, low-profile tank.

2)Whenever possible, ignition operations will be done on foot.

3) When motorized ignition operations are necessary (large units), only the Polaris UTVs will be used on this unit. This enables one person to be totally focused on safe driving and the passenger may operate the drip torch.","04/20/2007 00:00"

Until recently there has been no communication with the field agencies from that office as to why their plans have not been approved.

Recent communications, primarily due to the impedance of approval of a fire management plan (Ramah Navajo Agency) clearly indicate that these documents have been neglected due to a complete lack of knowledge and understanding of NFDRS, Fire behavior, WIMS, Fire Family +, and all relative Fire Danger Assessment guidelines and tools in the Regional Office.

The lack of approved plans has hampered our ability to staff in accordance to our indices.

Issue #2 – Because of this level of ineffectiveness, recent direction from the SWRO office in regards to Fire Danger Assessments have been farcical and are considered by this office to be a safety issue.

?	We are being directed to utilize a weather station with limited historical data for the sole reason that it currently indicates the lowest level of staffing, so we are being directed to underestimate our fire danger conditions solely for the sake of spending less money. It is displaying a low level due to the fact that the station has been placed in greenup, although we are not in greenup, to transition the fuels to cured from freeze-up.

?	We are being directed to utilize a fuel model that is not representative of our vegetation or fuels, again solely to under predict our fire danger for the sake of saving money.

In our opinion the directions given by the SWRO violates the following fire orders:

#1. Keep informed on fire weather conditions and forecasts.

This needs to be an on-going activity based on all available information.

#3. Base all actions on current and expected behavior of the fire.

It is important to consider not only the current and expected behavior, but consideration should be given to the unexpected or possible worst-case scenario.

In several recent firefighter fatalities and entrapments, one common denominator identified has been a lack of knowledge of weather and fire behavior conditions or an underestimation of those conditions! An example of this appears in the 2007 RT130 course materials, where the use of the wrong weather station gave a false sense of fire potential.

Key Assumptions within the National Fire Danger Rating System

There are four fundamental assumptions associated with the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS)

that must be understood if the system is to be properly applied and interpreted. They include:

1. NFDRS outputs relate only to the potential of an initiating fire, one that spreads, without crowning or spotting, through continuous fuels on a uniform slope.

2. NFDRS outputs address fire activity from a containment standpoint as opposed to full extinguishment.

3. The ratings are relative, not absolute and they are linearly related. In other words if a component or index doubles the work associated with that element doubles.

4. Ratings represent near worst-case conditions measured at exposed locations at or near the peak of the normal burning period.

In summary, fire danger rating is a numeric scaling of the potential over a large area for fires to ignite, spread, and require fire suppression action. It is derived by applying local observations of current or predicted conditions of fuel, weather, and topographic factors to a set of complex science-based equations.

The outputs of a fire danger rating system are numeric measures of fire business that provide a tool to assist the fire manager in making the best fire business decisions.","We have offered to train the staff in the use of NFDRS, FireFamily+, etc.; they have refused to accept assistance, therefore we propose the following action:

Develop an internal fire management committee consisting of local expertise, (FMO’s, AFMO’s, fuels staff, etc.) to review and approve Step-up /staffing plans and severity requests.","04/23/2007 00:00"

I was driving North bound on Interstate 25 South of Colorado Springs. At mile marker 100 I noticed three USFS PSF type 6 engines north bound in the number 1 lane traveling at a high rate of speed. The engines were driving quite close together in an obvious attempt to stay together and not let other cars in. At one point a civilian vehicle came between the first and second engine, the second engine activated its emergency lights to try to force the vehicle out of its way. The engines passed me at a high rate of speed, the speed limit on this part of the interstate is 75 mph, I speed up and matched their speed for a short time at 85 mph. The engines changed lanes repeatedly to weave around slower vehicles. At several times the engines had less than 1 second of following distance between them.

These drivers were not only in violation of policy and law but were also conducting various unsafe acts and placing civilians at undue risk. With all of the documented cases of engine accidents we need to be doing a much better job at ensuring we are operating our engines and crew vehicles in a safe manner.

These engines were quite dirty and appeared to be coming from an RX or other project.","Following policy and law would have mitigated this safety issue. These drivers would benefit from drivers training and a review of policy and state laws.","03/23/2007 00:00"

Two more employees were sent to rescue the first in another vehicle from the District Office. Again, the responding individuals were unable to contact dispatch via radio when they got in the area. Again, spotty cell phone coverage was all that was available to receive broken communications from both parties.

Incidents as these continue to jeopardize the safety of employees in the Winnemucca District. The area is also prone to large wildfires and incidents commonly experience the same safety hazard due to lack of communications.","A district repeater on Sonoma Mountain would provide radio coverage to this area as well as other areas that are currently in blackout zones.

The burns required medical attention and resulted in a painful lengthy recovery. No long term effects were recieved, other than scarring, and I was able to return to full duty.

The injury occurred while carrying two drip torches during a prescribed burning operation. I had just ran out of fuel in one drip torch and switched to my full one in my right hand. I kept carrying the empty one in my left hand. While walking, I did not realize the empty torch in my left hand was leaking residual fuel down my left leg in calf area of my pants. As I continued walking, my pant leg came in contact with the fire on the ground and ignited. I realized immediately that my pants were on fire and attempted to extinguish it. It became apparent after about ten seconds that I was not going to be able to extinguish it quickly. I could feel my leg burning, I knew I needed to get this situation under control quickly. Trying to smother the fire with my gloved hands simply was not working. I dropped to the ground and started using dirt to try and smother the fire. This attempt failed also. In a last attempt effort, I went for a canteen in my line gear and I was able to extinguish the fire. The approximate total time was one minute. I was suprised at how long it took me to put out the fire, as normal drip mix is fairly easy to extinguish.","I think while double torching individuals need to take safety precautions to ensure that their torchs are not leaking fuel on their body. It is easy to not pay attention to the torch which is not being used. Individuals need to realize that drip torches are not 100% leak proof and need to take safety precautions to mitigate this. In addition, when switching torches the empty torch should be carried with the wick down, and the air valve closed.

I also feel that the drip mix had to much of a gas component to it. With a higher diesel fuel component the the fire would have been easier to extinguish. The diesel fuel makes the mix a lot less volatile. With a normal drip mix ratio, I am confident that I would have been able to smother the fire a lot quicker.    I am simply just a lot more careful while I am carrying two drip torches.","06/20/2007 00:00"

We do not do any training
 no one has had a pack test to get our red cards. The junior manager allowed their spouse and another member to arrive on the scene with no PPE, training. I have my ICT=4 certificate but have not had my task book signed off yet. We were told by a dude from the BA that we could not go on the fire because we did not have red cards. Shortly after I left the scene. I was told by the junior manager to go to the fire station and stand by in case another truck was needed from the station but the junior manager let his spouse who is an EMT and another person take out our engine we use for structure and car fires. We don't have any fire training at all. I am going to turn in my fire stuff because the senior manager will not do anything to fix the problem. The senior manager knows I have more training and experience than the junior manager. I don't want my red card if I can't pass my pack test without cheating. When the senior manager and their partner got to the fire around 4:30 the senior manager did not attempt to get the people that didn't have any fire training off of the fire. Someone is going to be hurt because they don't have to take fire classes or use fire shelters on fires. We don't do monthly training like we used to with other senior managers. The junior manager did not call for resources or an Eng Boss to go on the call with us.","I was told when I joined the department that we had to go to the BA to do our pack tests because too many fire depts were cheating on pack tests. I think we need to have some one not related to the Arivaca fire department watch our pack tests and issue red cards. I think other agencies like the BA should make the whole department leave the fire when they know that we don't have our red cards. I think we need to do more training for fire and not let people that don't take the fire class go out on fires.    Nothing, they don't listen to me. The junior manager doesn't realize that because he just recently took the basic wildland class and I have been a wildland firefighter for 3 years that being junior manager goes out the window because he doesn't know what to do.

ALL VEHICLES AND PERSONNEL WERE ON SCENE AND ACTIVELY PURSUING THE FIRE BY 5:00 PM. INITIALLY THE JUNIOR MANAGER RESPONDED SOLO IN A BRUSH TRUCK AND THIS PERSON HAS NO PREVIOUS FIRE EXPERIENCE. PERSONNEL AND BOARD MEMBERS FROM ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE WERE NOTED TO BE ON THE FIRE SCENE WITHOUT PROPER PPE. ONE INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIED AS A BOARD MEMBER WAS ON THE FIRE SCENE IN BLUE JEANS, SNEAKERS AND A TEE-SHIRT, ANOTHER PERSON HAD ON NOMEX PANTS AND SHIRT WITH SNEAKERS AND NO HELMENT AND FIRE SHELTERS APPARENTLY WERE NOT EVEN THOUGHT OF TO BE USED BY THESE INDIVIDUALS ON THE FIRE. THE JUNIOR MANAGER WAS REPORTED TO BE ON THE FIRE LINE IN BUNKER GEAR RATHER THAN NOMEX.

INITIALLY THE JUNIOR MANAGER AND ONE WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTER WERE TOLD BY A MEMBER OF THE BUENOS ARIES FIRE STAFF THAT BECAUSE THEY HAD NO VALID RED CARDS THEY COULD NOT REMAIN ON THE FIRE. THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE RED CARDS WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF ONE OF THE BUENOS ARIES WILDLIFE REFUGE FIRE CREW MEMBERS WHEN HE ASKED IF THEY HAD VALID RED CARDS.

BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LEAVE THE FIRE SCENE, THEY WERE LATER TOLD BY AN UNNAMED SOURCE TO DO STRUCTURE PROTECTION OF A FEDERALLY OWNED RESIDENCE NEAR THE FIRE SCENE, ALTHOUGH NO ONE FROM THE ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT WAS ON THE SCENE AT THE TIME THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO DO THE STRUCTURE PROTECTION ARE TRAINED IN STRUCTURE PROTECTION.  AT THE TIME THEY BEGAN SAID STRUCTURE PROTECTION THEY PROCEEDED TO THE RESIDENCE TO PROVIDE THIS STRUCTURE PROTECTION FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

BY 5:00PM THE SENIOR MANAGER AND ANOTHER FIRE FIGHTER ARRIVED ON THE FIRE SCENE AND THERE WERE NOW A TOTAL OF SIX OR SEVEN PERSONNEL AND BOARD MEMBERS (THE SENIOR MANAGER AND ONE OTHER PERSON WHO ARRIVED LATER INTO THIS INCIDENT, AROUND 5 PM, ARE THE ONLY TWO PERSONNEL OF WHICH ARE TRAINED FIRE FIGHTERS ONE AND TWO) WORKING ON THIS FIRE. THE STRUCTURE PROTECTION PROVIDED BY ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE WAS DISCONTINUED AND THE PERSONNEL BEGAN A CHAOTIC SEARCH OF THE AREA FOR SPOT FIRES, LEAVING THE STRUCTURE UNPROTECTED. MOST IF NOT ALL PERSONNEL FROM ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE DO NOT HAVE VALID RED CARDS TO BE ON THE FIRE LINE. I OBTAINED THIS INFORMATION FROM THE WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTER I SPOKE WITH FROM ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE WHO HAS ASKED THAT I NOT NAME HIM. I ASKED THIS INDIVIDUAL IF THE BRUSH TRUCKS ARE BOTH STILL OVER WEIGHT AND IF THE PUMPS HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED. HE STATED THAT TO THE BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE BOTH BRUSH TRUCKS ARE STILL OVER WEIGHT, HAVE MECHANICAL ISSUES AND THE PUMPS HAVE NOT BEEN CERTIFIED AT ANY TIME DURING HIS EMPLOYMENT WITH ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE. IT IS UNCLEAR TO ME AS TO WHETHER OR NOT ALL TRUCKS RESPONDING ON THIS FIRE AND OTHER WILD FIRES IN THE AREA ARE COVERED UNDER THE STATE LAND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT, A FEDERAL COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT AND/OR ARE INSURED.

PER MY CONVERSATIONS WITH CURRENT SENIOR MANAGER ON 03/17/2007 AND ONE OF ARIVACA'S WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTERS: “REGULAR ON GOING TRAINING HAS BEEN NON EXISTENT IN THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE LAST 6 to 7 MONTHS” AND IT IS UNCLEAR AS TO HOW MANY OF THE PERSONNEL ON THIS FIRE AS WELL AS OTHER FIRES REPORTED BY BORDER PATROL ON ARIVACA ROAD ON 03/18/2007 HAVE HAD ANY SORT OF FORMAL TRAINING IN STRUCTURE PROTECTION AND/OR WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTING. ADDITIONALLY THERE WERE/ARE NO TRAINED AND QUALIFIED ENGINE BOSSES ON ANY OF ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS ENGINES ON EITHER OF THESE DATES (03/16/07 AND 03/18/2007) NOR ARE THERE ANY ENGINE BOSSES APPARENTLY ON THE ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT ROSTER WHICH MEANS THEY ARE RESPONDING TO WILD FIRES WITHOUT A QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL TO GUIDE THEM. ACCORDING TO THE ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTER I SPOKE WITH HE WAS NOT CERTAIN ALL PERSONS ON THE FIRE ON THE BUENOS AIRES REFUGE WERE COVERED BY WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION OR ANY OTHER INSURANCE TO COVER THEM FOR ON THE JOB INJURIES. SOME OF THE PERSONNEL THAT WERE ON THE 03/17/2007 FIRE WERE NOT EVEN REPORTED TO BE OFFICIALLY ON THE ROSTER AND WERE SAID TO BE RECRUITED BY TELEPHONE FOR ADDITIONAL MANPOWER ON THE FIRE FOR BACK UP AND BILLING PURPOSES. ADDITIONALLY, NO ONE REPORTED TO THEIR DISPATCHERS OR ANY OTHER AGENCY THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE RESPONDING ON THIS FIRE WHICH LOSES YOUR ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL PERSONNEL ON THE FIRE. APPARENTLY THE INITIALLY RESPONDING PERSONNEL FELT THEY NEEDED MORE BODIES ON THE FIRE AND IN TRUCKS FOR BILLING PURPOSES TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

THERE APPEARED TO BE A COMMUNICATION ISSUE BETWEEN ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE AND THE BUENOS ARIES WILDLIFE FIRE STAFF.

ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE USED AN UNTRAINED PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WITH OUT FIRE TRAINING OR FIRE EXPERIENCE AS A 'LOOKOUT' ON THE FIRE AND FROM RADIO COMMUNICATIONS HEARD ON ARIVACA'S FREQUENCY THERE WAS A LOT OF CHAOS AND DISORGANIZATION AND LITTLE TO NO COMMUNICATION WITH BUENOS ARIES REFUGE STAFF. THE LOOKOUT CONTINUALLY GAVE MISDIRECTIONS AS TO THE LOCATION OF THE VARIOUS SPOT FIRES. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE LOOK OUT AND THE BUENOS ARIES CREWS ON SCENE. THERE WERE NO CALLS MADE BY PERSONNEL ON ARIVACA'S FREQUENCY TO CONTACT OTHER AGENCIES FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OR TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE INCIDENT COMMANDER FROM THE BUENOS ARIES FOR DIRECTION OR ABOUT ARIVACA FIRE CREW WHEREABOUTS. NO ONE FROM THE ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED AN INCIDENT COMMANDER AT ANY TIME.

THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL FIRES RECENTLY IN THE AREA RECENTLY THAT ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE HAS ROLLED WHAT APPEARS TO BE ALL THEIR AVAILABLE VEHICLES ON AND SHOULD NOT BE RECEIVING REIMBURSEMENT BY THE FEDERAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR RESPONSES WHEN THEY HAVE NO ENGINE BOSSES OR QUALIFIED, TRAINED AND VALID RED CARD CERTIFIED WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTERS.

IT IS QUITE APPARENT IF ANYONE WERE TO GET COPIES OF THE CALL FROM ARIVACA'S DISPATCH CENTER, THAT LIVES OF THE PERSONNEL COULD HAVE BEEN ENDANGERED AND THE PERSONNEL THAT RESPONEDED WERE CLUELESS AS TO WHAT THEIR ROLES ARE ON A FEDERAL FIRE SCENE, OR ANY FIRE SCENE FOR THAT MATTER. THERE APPEARED TO BE LITTLE TO NO COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE BUENOS AIRES AND THE ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT.

IT IS MY CONCERN THAT EVENTUALLY BECAUSE NO ONE ON AN OFFICIAL LEVEL SEEMS TO BE OVERSEEING THIS DEPARTMENTS OPERATION THAT SOMEONE MAY GET KILLED OR INJURED DUE TO A LACK OF LEADERSHIP AND TRAINING.

I WAS TOLD BY A BUENOS AIRES EMPLOYEE THAT NOT ALL THE PERSONNEL FROM THE BUENOS ARIES WAS AWARE THAT ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE DID NOT HAVE TRAINED, RED CARDED PERSONNEL ON THE FIRE, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE INITIALLY TOLD TO LEAVE THE FIRE SCENE BY A MEMBER OF THE BUENOS ARIES FIRE STAFF.

THE STATE AND/OR FEDERAL OFFICIALS SHOULD MONITOR THIS DEPARTMENT EXTREMELY CLOSE AND MAKE THEM FOLLOW THE RULES THAT ALL OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAVE TO FOLLOW, INCLUDING ALL PERSONNEL OBTAINING A VALID RED CARD AND RECEIVING PROPER TRAINING. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME A BRUSH FIRE HAS BEEN REPORTED THIS YEAR THAT ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE HAS SENT ONLY ONE PERSON TO INVESTIGATE AND TO ATTEMPT TO EXTINGUISH. THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE AWARE OF PROPER PROCEDURES OR ARE NEGLECTING TO FOLLOW PROPER PROCEDURES ON WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTING INCIDENTS.

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT ALL FIRE DEPARTMENTS, ESPECIALLY VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THIS ONE ARE MADE AWARE OF THE RULES, REGULATIONS AND TRAINING NEEDED TO FIGHT FIRE ON EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS: FEDERAL, STATE AND PRIVATE LAND FIRE FIGHTING, SAFETY, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE, USE OF PERSONEL AS LOOK OUTS AND THE NEED FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS ON THE FIRE LINE.

CONSEQUENCES SHOULD BE STRICTLY ENFORCED FOR DEPARTMENTS THAT CONTINUALLY VIOLATE SAFETY ISSUES AS THIS DEPARTMENT HAS DONE REPEATEDLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENTS THAT CANNOT FULLY STAFF A TRUCK WITH ADEQUATELY TRAINED PERSONNEL THAT HAVE VALID, LEGAL RED CARDS THAT WERE OBSERVED BY A STATE OR FEDERAL OFFICIAL AND A QUALIFIED ENGINE BOSS CERTIFIED BY FEDERAL OR STATE OFFICIALS SHOULD NOT BE RESPONDING ON WILD LAND FIRES, ESPECIALLY FIRES THEY ARE SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT FROM FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS

USING MY TAX DOLLARS.

PER THE WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTER FROM ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT HE WAS TOLD BY HIS SUPERIORS THAT IF THE RED CARD ISSUE CAME UP, THEY COULD AND WOULD PROVIDE RED CARDS AND ATTEMPT A PACK TEST AT A LATER DATE.

ALL FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN THE AREA ARE AWARE OF ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT’S LACK OF TRAINING, RESPONSES WITH ONLY ONE EMT OR FIRE FIGHTER AND THEIR CONTINUAL IGNORING OF THE RULES, REGULATIONS AND SAFETY ISSUES AND THEIR ABILITY TO SKIRT PAST ALL THESE GUIDELINES WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. AS A FIRE FIGHTER WITH OVER 20 YEARS OF TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE I FEEL THAT THIS DEPARTMENT IS A DETRIMENT TO THE FIRE SERVICE IN GENERAL AND THAT FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING OSHA SHOULD BE INVESTIGATING AND MONITORING THEM CLOSELY. I WILL BE FILING A COMPLAINT WITH OSHA AS WELL AS THIS REPORT.","FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS SHOULD BE MONITORING TRAININGS AND RED CARD CERTIFICATIONS, AND EQUIPMENT USED SHOULD BE CERTIFIED BY AN OUTSIDE AGENCY PRIOR TO A VOLUNTER AGENCY BEING ALLOWED TO RESPOND ON PAID AND UNPAID FIRES ON FEDERAL OR STATE LAND. I WAS APPALLED TO HEAR ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE PERSONNEL TELL ME THAT IF I PURSUE MY COMPLAINTS THAT RED CARDS WOULD BE MANUFACTURED AND THAT PACK TESTS ATTEMPTED AT A LATER DATE.

VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENTS THAT CANNOT FULLY STAFF A TRUCK WITH ADEQUATELY TRAINED PERSONNEL THAT HAVE VALID, LEGAL RED CARDS THAT WERE OBSERVED BY A STATE OR FEDERAL OFFICIAL AND A QUALIFIED ENGINE BOSS CERTIFIED BY FEDERAL OR STATE OFFICIALS SHOULD NOT BE RESPONDING ON WILD LAND FIRES, ESPECIALLY FIRES THEY ARE SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT FROM FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS

ALL VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE SHOWN A HISTORY OF SAFETY VIOLATIONS SHOULD BE ON PROBATION AND MONITORED FOR THREE TO FIVE YEARS TO ENSURE THEY ARE FOLLOWING ALL NWCG AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS. THEY SHOULD ALSO BE BANNED FROM RESPONDING ON PAID FIRES BY FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES UNLESS THOSE AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO ASSUME THE RISK THESE ROGUE VOLUNTEERS ARE IMPOSING ON THE REST OF THE PERSONNEL FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE PROPERLY TRAINING AND FOLLOWING THE RULES. REPORTS OF VIOLATIONS SHOULD NOT BE BRUSHED UNDER THE CARPET. FINES TO HELP FUND TRAINING SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED.

ALL WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD HAVE A CERTIFICATION PROCESS TO GO THROUGH WITH STANDARDIZED TESTING AND BE DONE EVERY YEAR OR EVERY TWO YEARS JUST LIKE EMERGENCY PERSONNEL HAVE TO DO. THERE ARE CURRENTLY TOO MANY DEPARTMENTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE VOLUNTEER SECTOR, THAT ARE GETTING AWAY WITH IGNORING THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PUT INTO PLACE TO KEEP FIRE PERSONNEL SAFE. THE CURRENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE LEAVING TOO MUCH ROOM FOR HUMAN ERROR AND THE ABILITY FOR LIVES TO BE LOST UNNECESSARILY.

RED CARDS NEED TO BE ISSUED BY AGENCIES NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE DEPARTMENT SEEKING A RED CARD. FOR EXAMPLE ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ISSUE THEIR OWN RED CARDS, THEY NEED TO BE MONITORED BY AN OUTSIDE AGENCIES. IN MY 20 YEARS OF FIRE FIGHTING I HAVE SEEN TOO MANY VOLUNTEER AGENCIES ISSUE RED CARDS TO THEIR PERSONNEL WITHOUT THEM TAKING A PROPER, LEGAL AND FAIR WORK CAPACITY TEST.

PERSONS BEING USED AS LOOK OUTS ON FIRES SHOULD HAVE FORMAL TRAINING AS LOOK OUTS AND RECEIVE CERTIFICATION AS A LOOKOUT. IN THE INCIDENT ON 03/16/2007 THE LOOK OUT THAT ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE WAS USING WAS ERRONEOUSLY REPORTING SPOT FIRES THAT WEREN’T WHERE THE LOOK OUT STATED THEY WERE AND LIKE OTHER PERSONEL WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT IN APPARENT COMMUNICATION WITH INCIDENT COMMAND. 

TALKING TO THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS SEEMS TO HAVE NO EFFECT ON FIRE OPERATIONS PERFORMING IN A SAFE MANNER. THIS FIRE DEPARTMENT IS THE PERFECT POSTER CHILD FOR THE WRONG WAY TO RESPNSD ON CALLS, SOMEONE NEEDS TO GET THEM ON THE CORRECT PATH AND DOING THINGS CORRECT AND PROPER WAY BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INJURED OR KILLED.    ON 03/16/2007 I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT A FORMER FIRE CHIEF WITH ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE AND THE INDIVIDUAL STATED THAT HE/SHE HAS NOT BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND THAT THIS WAS NOT THEIR PROBLEM. THE INDIVIDUAL SIGGESTED THAT I SHOULD CONTACT A MANAGER OF THE BUENOS ARIES NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE OR THE VFD’S MANAGER WITH MY QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. WHILE HE/SHE PROVIDED CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS, HE/SHE WOULD NOT OR COULD NOT TELL ME THE LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE OF THE PERSONNEL CURRENTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT AGAIN TELLING ME THIS WAS A MATTER FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED MANAGERS. HE/SHE FURTHER STATED HE/SHE “WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CURRENT FIRE DEPARTMENT STAFF” AND SAID FOR ME TO” CONTACT SOMEONE WHO CARED.” A SECOND FORMER CHIEF THAT I CONTACTED BECAUSE I KNEW HE/SHE USED TO BE WITH ARIVACA VOLUNTEER FIRE TOLD ME HE/SHE WOULD NOT GET INVOLVED BECAUSE HE/SHE WAS TIRED OF BEING HARASSED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD AND FIRE DEPARTMENT.

I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT AN INDIVIDUAL ON 03/16/2007 BUT GOT A RECORDING PROBABLY BECAUSE IT WAS AFTER 5:00PM AND WAS NOT COMFORTABLE LEAVING A MESSAGE. I HAVE CHOSEN TO REPORT THIS ANONYMOUSLY SO THAT I AM NOT BLACK BALLED BY ANY OF THE AGENCIES INVOLVED AS I MAKE MY LIVING AS A FREE LANCE WILD LAND FIRE FIGHTER AND WORK WITH A NUMBER OF AGENCIES, BOTH VOLUNTEER AND DISTRICTS.

The decision to send this crew out was made by fire management of the E.O.R. The member of management knowing full well that the hand crew was not properly outfitted with the correct overhead and communications, went ahead and sent them on assignment. The crew had two squad bosses, no crew boss and no agency supervision. This crew also had minimal communications, one radio for the entire crew. The crew was also on initial attack assignment with this skeleton crew. The member of management of the region was fully aware of all red flag warnings but instead chose to ignore the situation, resulting in a fire vehicle roll over with trailer and equipment damaged. Damage estimate at $60,000. These events took place in the week of March 5-10, 2007.

Why didn't he use the agency crew from that district which had all overhead, proper communications and agency supervision?

What was his motivation to send this crew out? These are safety concerns that need to be addressed.    The problem has not been resolved. The decisions made by the manager are unprofessional and unsettling. Decisions like this are to be expected from an improperly trained individual in this position. This thought process will continue until there are serious injuries or until a fatality occurs.","03/20/2007 00:00"

Removing this repeater eliminates critical radio coverage to high fire occurrence areas resulting in a significant safety hazard for initial attack firefighters and field going personnel. One of the critical coverage areas is a wildland urban interface. The other is very remote.

The repeater is in place, and functioning well. It is very unobtrusive and meets land management goals for employee safety. It is being removed due to perceived political concerns of the wilderness area it is located in. This repeater is a minimum tool and cannot be seen from any distance. It is in a very remote and essentially untraveled area.

There are no alternative locations for the repeater.

The field office has recommended use of satellite phones and cell phones. The most common satellite carrier indicates a loss in service for the next few years. Cell service is unavailable to much of the repeater coverage area.","Management should consider choosing employee safety over wilderness values and political pressure.

The repeater should remain in place until a suitable EA for the minimum tool to provide employee safety is officially evaluated, considered and determined.    Meetings and discussions have been held regarding the topic. The repeater is planned to be removed on March 8, 2007.","03/06/2007 00:00"

This center handles the dispatch and resource tracking needs for the Deschutes and Ochoco N.F.’s, Prineville BLM and the Sisters and Prineville Units of the Oregon Dept. of Forestry.

The ticket was generated because the 20 phone and radio system back-up batteries located in the radio/phone room at COIDC were not providing back-up power. An ISO technician tested the batteries found 4 of them near 0 volts, the rest near 2.0 volts, and determined the batteries were 14 years old. He advised complete replacement.

Later on 2/08/2007, a Forest Service PNW Service Area 3 ISO technician advised me the cost to replace these batteries in order to provide 8 hours of service would cost over $2500. I was also advised that a “Service Request” would have to be generated and submitted to IRM for approval.

Since COIDC is a vital communications link for the above mentioned agencies, I was also advised to submit this Service Request as a high priority.

On 2/09/2007 a high priority Service Request was generated. Case #20071609 and request #1443. Business Requirements, Solution Summary and Scope, along with Primary Benefit and Risk if not Implemented were all addressed in the service request. An “auto-message” acknowledging receipt of the service request was generated and a Project Manager was assigned to review the Service Request.

On 2/14/2007 I received an e-mail requesting additional information and a question about weather the battery replacement was a Service Request or a Technical Approval. I submitted the additional information required.

On 2/15/2007 I received an “auto-message” that the Service Request had been accepted and it would be “assessed and prioritized according to ISO planned work objectives.” And “a project manager from ISO will soon be assigned and to this request. You will be contacted to begin project planning.”

At this point I believed the request was moving along.

No communication for quite some time on this subject from the ISO.

Talking 'off the record' with ISO Technicians during this lull in “official correspondence” the fact that COIDC was an interagency office and the BLM and ODF should bear some of the costs was brought up as a possible reason for the lack of in-action to date.

On 6/20/2007 I received another message from ISO Governace

Describing the disposition of the Service Request. Attached was a document showing the FS Office of the Chief Information Officer/Information Solutions Organization (OCIO/ISO) had reviewed the Service Request on 5/20/2007 and the OCIO Program Owner and the ISO Program Owner had both concurred to defer the Service Request until fiscal year 2008.

Upon receipt of this I advised the COIDC Center Mgr. and Inter-Agency Fire Mgmnt. Officer who in turn notified the Prineville BLM District Manager. It was decided the OCIO/ISO response was an unacceptable risk to employee safety and COIDC responses to emerging incidents.","The ISO must be more responsive.    After a meeting with COIDC, Inter-Agency FMO, Fire Staff, District Manager, Associate District Manager and District Comptroller it was decided BLM would purchase and install the batteries as soon as possible. The OCIO/ISO timeline was too vague and much to far into the future.","07/29/2007 00:00"

The end result of working a night shift, going through two demob processes, traveling two hours to their home unit, and then returning their equipment to a servicable condition was a 22 hour shift.","To my knowledge, the personnel involved did not complain as they were anxious to return home.

Unfortunately, there has been no response to that submission. In soliciting input for this years refresher, I was asked again that we attempt to address this situation and given the following narrative from the Engine Boss that was assigned to the resource that was demobed.

'We were Demobed at the last minute from this fire because our DIVS and his Trainee decided they didn’t want to be on the fire(personal reasons) for what would most likely be the last “Night Operational Period.” Because of this and the “closeness of our home unit” we were told we were to Demob immediately and head back to our home unit. This made for a very long (24 hour shift). It didn’t seem like a bad idea at first(we all wanted to get home), but we were dragging when we were cleaning the rig, then driving it to maintenance and especially when we were driving our POV’s home. It had tragic event written all over it and I am surprised that the Type I Team told us to do it, being that they would be held responsible. Them being held responsible means very little when my crew is dead…It was my fault and I should have told them no and we should have slept one more night in the Elk’s Lodge Basement and then went home. No matter how good you feel right after shift, you need the rest before you work/travel again. The 2:1 is there because of other tragic events and it shouldn’t be ignored!'","Clearly, the Engine Boss bears some responsibility and takes his part in making that decision very seriously. There is also a responsibility on the part of the assigned IMT and the agency administrator to insure that 2:1 is followed and that the health and safety of all personnel is their highest priority.","02/20/2011 00:00"

There was no personnel at Fort Yukon but the Mule was there and ready to be taken back to Fort Wainwright.

After securing the load we took off for the 45 minute flight to Ladd field. Approximately 15 minutes into the flight myself and the pilots smelled what seemed like gasoline so we cracked the rear ramp for ventilation thinking maybe some fuel sloshed around while loading it or that gas fumes were venting when we climbed to a higher altitude. After 5 or ten minutes the smell of fuel became stronger so I checked the mule and discovered there was fuel dripping out of a tube coming from the bottom of the fuel/water seperator on the vehicle. I informed the pilots of the situation and secured the dripping fuel by zip tying a jumper puke bag to the fuel/water seperator canister thus stopping the fuel from leaking in the plane.

I discussed with the pilots our next plan of action once the fuel leak was contained and it was determined that we would continue to Ladd field since turning around to a place to land and get rid of the mule would take as much time as making it back to Ladd field.

We landed at Ladd field with no problems and promptly unloaded the mule. I alerted our small engine shop and the zone about the problem. We left the rear ramp on the jumpship open that night and it aired out sufficiently to not affect any operations the next day.

When we went to pick up the mule we were told it was ready to haul and during the loading process we didn't observe anyting which would make us think that it was or would be leaking fuel.

The zone and small engine shop were made aware of the situation so this shouldn't happen again. The mule has been transported by aircraft numerous times in the past without incident so this seems to be an anomaly. It was a good reminder to everyone to make sure all fuel sytems are properly drained or secured before transporting vehicles by aircraft","As described above I alerted the pilots to the situation, secured the fuel leak and consulted with the pilots on a safe plan of action. We were able to provide significant ventilation in the jumpship by opening the rear ramp a small amount in flight.","09/19/2010 00:00"

We joined up at the Four Mile ICP in Boulder with a DIVS and a task force that included engines and tenders. Upon arriving at the incident at ~19:00, we were told to stage until night briefing @ 21:00. The briefing was short and included very little intelligence on the fire. even 11 hours after the start of the fire, the IAP had serious flaws: It was hand written and difficult to read in spots; the map was vastly inaccurate, including an incorrect fire perimeter, even in areas easily reconned and verified; a map that was out-of-date, with roads that no longer existed, roads that were a 1/4 mile off from where they actually were on the ground, and no current structure locations or addresses.

We were initially given an assignment to tie in with Mo Lake IHC and assist them in cold trailing and line construction on the east side of the fire, progressing to the north and west. Right out of the gates, we had confusion of where we were supposed to report, as did Mo Lake and several DIVS, since none of us had been on the fire yet. This confusion was a result of an incomplete briefing, inaccurate maps, and no planned tie-in with day resources.

Upon arriving at the access we believed to be correct, we tied in with an individual who stated that a structure on James Park Trail (the road we were on) was imminently threatened and that “we had better get up their right away.” At this point, he and other day resources left the area. This exchange lasted 1-2 minutes. Resources from both Div A (west side) and Div B (east side) were confused on where they were to report based on both the radio traffic and my observations of vehicles driving into areas outside of their divisions. The resources utilized one another and the night DIVSs to try and sort these issues out.

Knowing that several of the 18 Watch Outs were in play, (1.Fire not scouted and sized up, 2.In country not seen in daylight 5.Uninformed on strategy, tactics, and hazards, 6.Instructions and assignments not clear. 11. Unburned fuel between you and the fire, 12. Cannot see main fire, not in contact with anyone who can, 13. On a hillside where rolling material can ignite fuel below.), we contacted our DIVS and DIVS(t) and advised them of the situation. We suggested that we send our chase truck to scout the area and determine the location of the threatened structure and feasibility of safely engaging in structure protection at this house. I determined that the house was indeed defensible, advised our DIVS and DIVS(t) of this fact, and they subsequently assigned our module to the house. Both the DIVS and DIVS(t) were also scouting the area to increase S/A for the resources assigned to the division.

Throughout the night, we attempted to pinpoint ourselves on the map, using our limited knowledge of the area, GPS, the geographic features we could see at night, mileage from a known location, and intel from our DIVS and DIVS(t). We were unsuccessful, primarily due to the out-of-date maps.

The following day, we were advised that the day shift briefing would occur at 07:00. 07:00 came and went, with no communication to my knowledge regarding shift change. At ~0840, we noticed the inversion lifting, winds increasing and shifting from down slope/down valley to winds out of the southeast, and an increase in fire behavior (Watch out #15). The weather was also getting hotter and dryer (Watch out #14), with increases in temp and decreases in RH noted every half hour as we spun weather.

We also attempted to triangulate our location using known landmarks, but as the inversion lifted allowing us to see these landmarks, the smoke increased, obscuring them again. We were able to get a rough triangulation, but the location did not place us near the road, since the road on the map was ~1/4 away from where it is currently located. Now that we had day light, I scouted the area by vehicle to increase our S/A, but we could still not determine our exact location on the map. We attempted to use lat/long info, but the map was a copy of an old 7.5’ quad and the coordinate grids on the edge of the map were cut off.

After having rested the personnel on the module in shifts over night, we reengaged in active structure protection, requesting air resources to assist. At ~1200 hours, our DIVS had no intel on shift change, which had not yet occurred, even after requesting this info from OPS.

I requested a heavy helitanker to follow up some retardant lines that had recently been dropped. Pike IHC contacted us on our tac and stated they had a higher priority mission for the ship and asked if they could borrow the ship for a few drops. I agreed and requested confirmation of their tac frequency, so we could coordinate our efforts. They advised their tac was “Tac 2.” I tried to confirm if this was the same as Fern 2, the tac frequency we had been using on night shift. It was not. Pike provided us their tac frequency.

We were not notified at any time of a change to the comm. plan. The air-to-ground frequency had also changed, which we found out about from our DIVS after being unable to contact air attack several times. This was not made known to night shift personnel who had rolled into day shift operations. We also came to realize our division had changed from Div B to Div X, but only through radio traffic, not through a formal notification (Watch out # 7 -No communication link with crewmembers/supervisors).

At this point, we were told by our DIVS to return to ICP, as day shift resources were now on scene. This occurred at ~1330. I advised my DIVS that I was attempting to work the helitanker on a 6’ tall hedgerow of slash that, while it had been painted with retardant, was actively burning under the retardant line and would cause our line to be compromised; if this line had occurred, the fire would have likely dropped down into the adjacent draw to the south of the structure, made a run at an adjacent structure, and potentially compromised the area’s primary escape route. DIVS stated he had made that clear to Ops and the incoming DIVS, who had not yet seen the piece of line, but that we were still to abandon the line. As I left the area and returned to the house, I ran into a STEN and ENGB from day shift who had been assigned to the area. I briefed them and advised them of my concerns. They stated they were headed down to look at the piece of line in question.

We departed this location for ICP at ~1345.","1. Recognized the watch outs which existed and the standard fire orders that were being violated, briefed the module on these concerns and how we were mitigating them.

2. Communicated effectively with our DIVS and DIVS(t).

3. Posted multiple lookouts in varied locations to monitor fire behavior.

4. Spun weather on the half hour, calculated FDFM and PIG to monitor trends in weather and fire behavior.

5. Scouted the area around the structure by vehicle and foot to increase S/A as much as possible.

6. Identified multiple escape routes and safety zones and make the escape plan known to all personnel in the module.

7. Rested crew members in shifts to mitigate work/rest issues.","09/16/2010 00:00"

On September 1, 2010 Alaska Fire Service (AFS) personnel were informed that members of the Joint Fire Science board (JFS) were escorted by University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) employees to an active fire on lands managed by the BLM Northern District where fire management is provided by the Military Zone of AFS. The site visited is an unpermitted research plot established by UAF on BLM lands that have been set aside for military training purposes. Although there are established federal protocols and procedures regarding entering active fire areas as well as military training areas, they were not followed during this fieldtrip which resulted in a potentially dangerous situation.

The JFS and UAF personnel who visited the fire area neglected to inform the land manager, AFS, or the incident Commander of their intent to enter the area. Personnel on the fieldtrip lacked PPE, a fire line briefing, or the mandatory escort by line qualified personnel.

There are two significant safety concerns that individuals entering the fire area needed to be aware of: One concern is that due to the fact that the roots of timber in the area visited have been burned out because the ground conditions are extremely dry, there is a significant high risk that timber could fall on an individual visiting this area. The second significant safety concern is that within the fire area there is a potential of encountering unexploded ordinance as this land has historically been used for military training.

A significant effort was put into informing the public of safety concerns regarding the fire. It is a concern that regardless of all federal policies in place and the efforts of the Alaska Fire Service, DOD Army Alaska, and the BLM that individuals placed themselves in such a potentially dangerous situation.","","09/02/2010 00:00"

The IC notified the local dispatch, worked with dispatch and ordered the ground ambulance service. There were several calls made into dispatch from the EMT, local Trial FMO and other local management official which caused some delays in the response.

RA was not wearing any of his personal protective equipment when he was in the theater of operations and on the actual fireline. RA was wearing blue jeans and he had no fire shirt on. I know that these safety items are available to him and he probably has them with him, yet refuses to wear them. RA did not take the pack test, and therefore should not have been assigned to the fire in the first place.

RA also took a rancher and his dozer and gave him direction that is in direct violation of wildland fire and district policy. RA has attended district training which explains policy pertaining to the use of ranchers and their equipment that is not signed up on contract. RA totally violated policy by giving a rancher direction and approval to cut dozer line on federal lands and within boundaries of the incident being managed by BLM personel. The rancher has no PPE, no communication equipment, no formal wildland fire training, and no dozer boss assigned. The rancher's dozer has not been signed up on contract and has had no pre-use inspection. RA also did not get the line officer's approval to construct dozer line. This is not how the Boise District BLM does business and RA's actions create a myraid of safety concerns and policy violations. As a resource advisor he is expected to rein in the ranchers on scene and prevent them from taking suppressive and ground disturbing action on a federally managed fire, yet he has done the complete opposite.

RA also violated the 2:1 work rest policy and did not get the proper approval to work over a 16 hour shift from the incident commander and duty officer.

RA obviously has shown a complete disreguard for the safety policies set forth by the BLM and has encouraged others to act in an unsafe manner as well. He has not acted as a overall team member and participant of the incident command team.","PPE ISSUE

The operational folks noticed RA's lack of PPE, yet they did not directly address it because of his history of not complying.

I looked into this following the incident, and found that there is no record on file or in IQCS documenting that RA took the pack test in 2010.

RANCHER DOZER ISSUE

The operational folks on the fire spent valuable time trying to get the ranchers to pull off the fireline. The incident commander told RA to get the ranchers off the line, but RAdoes not carry through with this message. Instead, he encourages them to do the opposite.

IA Dispatcher and Center Manager went through normal checks at consoles. One Base station (Zenobia) continued to transmit.

Local radio tech was advised of issue. Tech informed Center Manager that he had just done a 'hot swap' of radio cards in the telecom room, which was for the three base stations that were affected. He didn't know why Zenobia didn't come back up after that, as it should not have gone down since it is 'hot swap' capable. Notified the Pine fire that Maybell/Zenobia was down and needed fire to switch to the Juniper repeater. Center manager advised radio tech to we needed to be notified in advanced of any planned radio outages.

Center Manager and radio tech continued to do radio checks after consoles were reset by radio tech. No improvement, so radio tech decided he needed to drive to the mountain top to reset radio there, expected hour drive to mountaintop.

The card swap was NOT required to be completed at this time as it was to replace a card that was 'borrowed' from the NW Net card. Dispatch center still had communications on NW NET on state consollettes.

Radio tech didn't notify dispatch ahead of time of planned swap. This lack of situational awareness and poor decision making at 1420 on August 26th with High to Very High fire incides reported is unacceptable and posed additional risks to firefighters and public.","Notified resources on fire to switch to another repeater.

Repeatedly throughout this fire season we have been having problems communicating with our dispatch center (Columbia Cascade Center) on our repeated frequencies. Columbia Cascade Center is the dispatch center for The Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and the Mt. Hood National Forest. I am not sure if the Gifford Pinchot or Mt. Hood are having problems, but the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area (CRGNSA) definitely is.

There are several problems that we have been trying to troubleshoot, but no solid solutions have been created yet. One of the problems we are having is that our resources can receive and transmit on our frequencies without any problems. All of our vehicle and handheld radios can receive and transmit on all of our frequencies and be heard on all other radio units. However, when we call our dispatch center, we only receive their radio transmissions approximately 75% of the time. During the last week though, it has been even less. We have had 4 fires in the last week and we had to rely on cell phones to communicate with dispatch during these incidents.

This presents a huge problem because we cannot rely on cell phones for our primary communication link to dispatch. There are dead spots all through our protection area where we don't have cell phone coverage. We just got lucky with these last 4 fires and thank goodness we had cell phone coverage.

Another problem we've been having with our radio communications on our repeated frequencies is that there has been routine maintenance happening during fire season. So when we need to use our frequencies, we are forced to work around the maintenance schedule.

Another issue is that there is not a backup plan in place for situations like this. We cannot hear our dispatch center call us, therefore we don't exactly know if they can hear us. There needs to be a backup plan to have solid communication with our dispatch that doesn't involve cell phones.","Like I mentioned, we were lucky enough to have cell phone coverage during our fires this week so we were able to mitigate our lack of radio communication by calling dispatch via cell phone.

We mitigated our dispatch and tracking needs by having our Duty Officer dispatch our resources and track them because the Duty Officer was able to communicate with us and stayed in areas that he had cell phone coverage - so if necessary, he could communicate with dispatch. We also were given permission to switch over to using a repeated frequency on our neighboring forest, so we were able to communicate with dispatch on that frequency when necessary. But the problem with using their frequency is that there was now the communication load of two units on one frequency - twice the traffic on one less frequency.

Although we are able to work around our lack of communication with dispatch for now, these solutions should be viewed as nothing more than temporary mitigations until a solution more permanent and reliable can be put in place. Using cell phones and relying on cell phone coverage for communicating with dispatch and using a different forest's frequency are only going to work so long before those unreliable solutions break down at a critical moment - such as during a medical emergency.","08/26/2010 00:00"

I observed an Idaho Power service truck parked between the fires edge and the power lines. An individual, who I presume to be the an Idaho Power employee, had shovel in hand and was actively throwing dirt to attempt to suppress the fire as it approached the power poles. As I watched, it appeared that resources assigned to the fire began to arrive in the same area and the individual protecting the power poles departed in the service truck.

The crew worked a 15-hour shift, clocking off at 0100 on August 21, 2010. The crew was off the clock for 5 hours and came back on at 0600 at the request of the IC.

At 1600 on August 21, the crew was reassigned to an intial attck fire on the Boise District BLM. One of our chase trucks broke down a few miles north of Jackpot, NV. The time it took to transfer essential gear to another vehicle and coordinate towning the chase truck into Twin Falls, ID delayed getting the portion of the crew involved in the IA their overnight gear.

The IC, after becoming aware of the hours the crew worked the previous day informed the crew they would be off at 2130 to get back in line with the 2:1 work/rest policy, without any overnight gear including sleeping bags. The Assistant Crew Supervisor, who was with the chase trucks, with Duty Officer approval declined this request and drove the gear to the crew to ensure meaningfull rest; not just rest on paper, arriving on the fire at 2330.

The Interagency Business Management Handbook states in Chapter 10-26 'when non-exempt regular government employees and casuals do not receive adequate food and lodging, they shall be in pay status the entire time they are working, sleeping or eating.' 10, 26-3. 'Adequate lodging is described as: sleeping bag (paper or cloth), or a blanket or equivalent covering to provide protection from the elements for sleeping.' 26, 10-3. 'Hours recorded for an inadequate food or lodging situation count as hours of work for computation of the 2:1 work/rest ratio.' 26, 10-3. The shift for August 21 was 18.5 hours.

The Interagency Standard for Fire and Aviation Operations Guide states in Chapter 07-3, 'Work shifts that exceed 16 hours and/or consecutive days that do not meet the 2:1 work/rest ratio should be the exception, and no work should exceed 24 hours. However, in situations where this does occur (for example intial attack), incident management personnel will resume 2:1 as quickly as possible.' State of Idaho and local district policy states, 'Remember - working beyond 16 hours should not be considered the norm the 36-hour window is the exception that allows us to operate effectively and must be carefully managed. The 36-hour window starts at the time you come on duty. You need to get approval before you exceed 16-hours from the duty officer. Once 16-hours is approved, you can work up to 36-hours without more approval. However, IC's will strive to get 4-6 hours of rest for crews between midnight and 0700 at a minimum. If this rest is not achieved, crews will be replaced on the fireline before the end of the 36-hour shift when resources are available. For any 36-hour shift (and anything over 20 hours). you will have a mandatory shut down of 10 hours.'

The crew, with Duty Officer approval, ended up exceeding the 36-hour window by 1.5 hours to ensure meaningfull rest with adequate gear.","Once the crew had the neccessry gear to ensure proper rest, with hours not computated into the 2:1 work/rest, they took 10-hours off.","09/21/2010 00:00"

It happened yesterday at approximately 1215 and again today at approximately 1700. Both times that this happened we had multiple aircraft in the air and were involved in active fire suppression on numerous incidents.

The potential issues are enormous. If we had a medical emergency we would have no way to initiate a response. If we had emergency aircraft information we would have no way to relay information. We have no way to keep our fire forces informed on weather, warnings, red flag watches, status of resource orders, change in resource status, status of other adjacent fires, actions of adjoining forces….Communication is a critical element in everything we do during fire suppression operations. Without good communication we cannot engage the fire creating additional safety concerns to our fire forces as well as the public. We have had continuous radio issues off and on all summer.

I was told that some network people decided to unplug this or that to run a check on something. This is completely unacceptable during the heat of the day.

This has the potential for a great safety concern due to the fact that NM-SDC services Federal and State Agency activity within the Gila / Las Cruces Zone (ie. the entire SW corner of the State of NM.) In the event of a power outage during periods of high activity, events such as this would affect hundreds of ground and air personnel during the peak of fire season.

Officer","Duty Officer","4","","Wildland;","Line;","Initial Attack;","Communications;","","","In a recent interagency response to a wildfire, radio communications between firefighting resources may have been compromised in part because of incorrect use of transmit and receive tones on the assigned tactical frequency for that incident.

Background:

For 2010, Oregon Department of Forestry has added receive tone guards on their direct and tactical frequencies. This includes ODF RED NET (151.340) and ODF WHITE NET (151.310) where a tone of 156.7 was added to both the receive and transmit functions. This reduces interference on those frequencies from adjacent units.

To communicate on these direct channels, the sending radio must be transmitting the correct tone to the receiving radio. If the correct transmit tone is not selected, the transmitting unit will not be heard.

The Forest Service has several radio groups where the tone is user selectable. On these groups, the correct tone for the tactical channel must be selected from the number pad in order to be heard.

To use RED NET or WHITE NET on Forest Service radios to communicate with ODF resources, the FS radios must have been cloned with the 2010 frequency scheme. Radios that were not re-cloned this spring will not be able to communicate with ODF on these frequencies. Also, these radios must have the correct tone selected. For RED NET and WHITE NET, this tone is 156.7, and selection is different for each group in the radio.

This is a new process for Forest Service radios – prior to this year, there have been no receive tones associated with any tactical channels (Except for BLM SOA).

On King Hand-helds, receive tone-guard function may be bypassed on the receiving radio only by NOT having the squelch turned counterclockwise to the indent (see users guide). This is not an option on mobile radios.

Recommendations:

Assure all FS radios are cloned with the 2010 frequency scheme

Incorporate training with firefighting personnel on use of transmit tones on tactical channels in your next morning briefing or safety session.

All users should keep a current 2010 Frequency and Radio Guide or frequency pocket cards readily available to identify which tone to use on these tactical frequencies","Conducted After Action Review of incident with assigned resources from both agencies. Identified communication issues that occurred on incident and instructed resources on possible communication breakdown with changing transmit tones and not changing back to correct recieve tone on Red Net.

dozer line to the east. There was not alot of activity but there were some

flare ups and short range spotting. Engines were parked along the CP-7 rd.

and had egress in both directions. The crews used drip torches to perform

the burn out. One of the engine crew members was a little nervous not

having had prior experience using a drip torch in an active fire setting.

The crew boss had her stay by his side and explained what he was doing and

why. All other crew members were performing thier duties. She was feeling

more comfortable when a flare up with increased intensity of heat, curling

over their engine and spotting, occurred along the CP-7 road adjacent to

one of the three engines. Having the LCES briefing fresh in her mind, she

ran into the green knowing she should change direction and get into the

black. The other crew members seeing this reaction, ran after her to keep

the crew together. The crew boss quickly gathered up the crew members back

into their engine and proceeded away from the flare up back to the parking

area. The Willamette Type 2 crew, Redmond IHC, and all 3 engines traveled

out on the CP-7 road to the South away from the fires edge. Seven Overhead,

Per CWN light fixed wing contract, the SQF ordered a Turbine, High wing, pressurized ATGS platform for the incoming type 1 team (Bull Fire). Per the CWN contract 'Orders for service will be placed with the Contractor as needed. Orders will be filled based on performance, cost and urgency.' The SQF ordered this type of platform with the above mentioned specs, based on needed performance requirements that include fights over 10'500 ft, extreme high temps, very turbulent flying conditions and IFR conditions that are associated with the nearest airport, (Kernville). This order was denied by South Ops. When question why, it was stated that the Regional RAO had denied the order. Several attempts to contact the RAO by phone and e-mail were unsuccessful. When South Ops was re -contacted, it was stated they would order a normally aspirated aircraft. My response was 'Negative', we as the SQF and as the Forest Aviation Officer, will only accept the original order with the stated specs. Several hrs later, the order was filled with the SQF originally requested platform. There are multiple issues associated with the decisions that were made at the upper management level, 1. The efficiency and effectiveness of all Ariel Supervision Missions are dependent on having the correct match up of equipment for the mission. No one knows this better than the initial ordering point (Home Unit), as well as the assigned mission commander, (ATGS or ASM). 2. Efficiency and effectiveness are directly related for the safety of all involved at any given incident and with any aviation operations.","CORRECTIVE ACTION (What was done to correct the problem)

The following policies must be understood and followed at all levels of Management involved in making decisions for high risk operations.

(Chapter 1, 2010 Red Book)

Fire Operations Command Philosophy:

'Subordinate commanders must make decisions on their own initiative based on their understanding of their commander’s intent. A competent subordinate commander who is at the point of decision may understand a situation more clearly than a senior commander some distance removed. In this case, the subordinate commander must have the freedom to take decisive action directed toward the accomplishment of operational objectives.'

Fire Suppression:

'The purpose of fire suppression is to put the fire out in a safe, effective and efficient manner. Fires are easier and less expensive to suppress when they are small. When the management goal is full suppression, aggressive initial attack is the single most important method to ensure the safety of firefighters and the public and to limit suppression costs. Aggressive initial attack provides the Incident Commander maximum flexibility in suppression operations. Successful initial attack relies on speed and appropriate force. All aspects of fire suppression benefit from this philosophy.'

Cost Effective Fire Operations:

'Maximizing the cost effectiveness of any fire operation is the responsibility of all involved; including those that authorize, direct or implement those operations. Cost effectiveness is the most economical use of the suppression resources necessary to accomplish mission objectives. Accomplishing fire operations objectives safely and efficiently will not be sacrificed for the sole purpose of “cost savings.”'    This event is being managed through the SAFECOM system.","07/27/2010 00:00"

I noticed that one extinguisher was missing a safety pin, making it a risk for unintentional discharge. I mentioned this to those helping me with the backhaul, and placed it in the bottom of the cage (it was one of the first items off the plane). After further unloading I found a safety pin in the plane and installed it in the previously mentioned extinguisher. I tied it in place with a scrap piece of cord, as a temporary safety measure.

We finished unloading the plane, including six more fire extinguishers some of which I personally handled, and some I did not. After the cage was full I moved it with a forklift to a temporary outdoor backhaul staging area. Upon setting the cage down, I noticed what appeared to be a white vapor coming from beneath the backhaul. Fearing a chemical reaction that could result in a fire, I picked the cage up again and moved it away from the staging area (an area often populated by fuel cans and other hazerdous material). Upon closer inspection I noticed that a fire extinguisher had been placed in the cage without a safety pin. The weight of the other items loaded above it had enough weight to depress the handle and discharge the tank.

I am concerned about the likelyhood of a similar incident occuring in the future for the following hazerdous risks:

-Inhalation hazard, of particulate stored in the tank.

-Irritaion to eyes if blown in the direction of workers.

-Rapid discharge of pressurized gas in close proximity to workers.

-Combining of gas and/or particulate with other material in a possibly volitile mixture.

Discharge during transport aboard an aircraft combined with the risks mentioned above, could be a much more hazerdous situation.","After moving the cage from the staging area, and while wearing a respirator, the cage and surrounding area were cleaned to remove as much particulate as possible. The cage was then taken inside to a well ventilated area and emptied for further cleaning. The particulate was removed with a vacuum cleaner and by sweeping,as well as pressure washing,and wiping items down.

The personnel in the department were briefed on the situation, informed on the risks of accidental discharges and insturcted to carefully inspect fire extinguishers for missing pins whenever they are handled.

Those responsible for the demobilization of fires and loading of aircraft should be made aware of the risks, and the simple preventitive measures required.","07/26/2010 00:00"

The crewmember was feeding a oak log log into the chipper and as the log was sucked in it kicked up and smashed the individuals thumb on the outside of the top part of the protection hood. The individual had let go of the log, but due to the twisted bole it didn't feed straight in which caused it to kick up just as he let go. The paramedic assesed the patient, and requested a medivac, due to the remote location and nature of injury (substantial damage/degloving of the end of the left thumb). Communication was smooth between Paramedic-Operations-IC & IC trainee-Dispatch getting the helicopter to the adjacent helispot and the individual was shuttled to Scottsdale Osborne Medical Center. We had prior discussions on the Medical Plan in the IAP, and it was followed.","Prior to the incident, daily briefings included safety measures in working with the chipper, including a JHA which was signed by all using the chipper. Extra emphasis was put on the dangerous nature of the chipper, and chainsaws, and all personnel were wearing PPE. An AAR was performed on the fire, with discussion how to prevent a re-occurance of the injury. Feeding strait bole trees and leaving the more twisted ones because of the danger of them twisting as they fed in was one way we attempted to mitigate the hazard. Also leaving the trees longer and feeding the tip in fist and letting the chipper suck it in kept personnel a further distance from the hopper. All personnel were well aware of the danger of the cutting part of the chipper- there is also a hazard from the logs as they are fed in and twist with thier shape.

Upon Hearing the dispatch units were dispatched on Forest Net. Check back of responding units was very scratchy and unclear. The LPF has been having Radio issues for the last couple of months and Radio technicians have been trying to diagnose the problem with little success.

Upon arriving at the fire I tried to call LP on both Forest net and Service net to advise them that I was on scene. I had no luck in raising our dispatch center. The fire was under Forest jurisdiction and the command frequency was supposed to be on Service net since it had been the most reliable lately on the district. This did not happen because dispatch could not hear us nor we could hear them. This was a multi agency response involving 7 different agencies.

The continuing problem with Forest radio system is no longer acceptable and must be given the highest priority to be fixed. Numerous help tickets and safecoms have been placed with some diagnostic help provided. Implementation of the Radio System repair on the LPF must happen swiftly before we have a serious incident caused by the lack of quality radio operability.

In conclusion it is worth stating again that the Santa Barbara Front Country Fire responses are very complex given all the agencies that respond. History has proved that fires of large magnitude have and will continue to occur in this zone. Communication is one the cornerstones of running the incident smoothly and safely. Fires in the Front Country of Santa Barbara, Goleta, Montecito, and Carpenteria would involve the following agencies at a minimum; SBCO FD, SBC FD, CARP FD, MTO FD, USFS, SBSO, and CHP. All of these agencies may have some jurisdictional authority depending on the complexity of the incident. Interagency communication must be clear and dependable.","After some quick diagnosis that the Forest Command frequencies would not work, I coordinated with the first in Chief officer from Santa Barbara County and decided to use their assigned Command channel for command net.

I was driving a 2008 Dodge Ram Turbo Deisel Super Cab. As normal operations proceded throughout the day I was required to drive down the dozerline extensively that was being constructed. After roughly five miles of dozerline the chase's computer signaled that the Particulate Filter in the exhaust system of the truck was at 80% full and needed to regenerate to clean the filter. I immediately then began to proceed to pavement due to the specifications of the regeneration process outlined in the owners manual of the vehicle. As stated in the owners manual; the vehicle needs to maintain at least Sixty MPH for at least 30 minutes without cruise control active. Within no more than seven minutes the computer on the truck showed that the filter was now 90% full. It is important to denote that once the truck reaches 99% the truck will shut down and go into emergency mode, which means it will not exceed 10mph and it would require repairs. Due to the situtation and fire behavior, and light flashy fuel type, I was forced to tow the truck out the dozerline over 8 miles to get it to a highway where I would be able to follow the proper regeneration process.","The action taken was: once the truck module showed 80% I imnediately tried to return the truck to pavement so I could regenerate the truck.

The State Communications Manager was informed of this problem and is working with the local radio technician to clearly identify the problem and possible solutions.

Suggested corrective actions:

1. All fire personnel should check to ensure the microphone works before leaving the station.

2. Ensure that one portable radio is with each vehicle. Additionally, if possible, vehicles should carry magnetic mounted antenna that can plug in to the handheld radio. See the local radio technician.

3. Radio technicians will replace any problem microphone.

4. Dispatchers should review the procedure on how to force a repeater to transmit and if this problem occurs again make an announcement to the field to check there radio for a “stuck microphone.”","07/23/2010 00:00"

This is a pre-determined Zone Initial Attack Air-to-Ground frequency that was not readily available or programmed into the local IA bank of frequencies RE: 2010 CRC Fire Frequency List for Group 16. Note: There is no South Zone Secondary Air-to-Ground in this group which was the Air-to-Ground frequency designated for use on the Rough fire on 7/9/10. The code plug for Group 16 had an open channel available.

Brief history is that the radio code plugs were determined to require some revision this last fall. As this process unfolded several versions were looked at and in general not user friendly. They took into account some but not all the input from local users.

Frequency lists (Code plugs) were generated by State Office lead, some local input was requested and provided. Many discussions were held and freq lists eventually created even when it was apparent that revisions did not make sense for local unit operations in some cases.

As far as Air-to-Ground freqs go, we like many other units have asked for a solid deadline to have the Zone IA Air-to-Ground frequency assignments with any changes done and assigned from Boise prior to fire season (Jan 1). It is difficult to track version to version changes after deadlines come and then we see yet another version sent out.

In Colorado the frequency groups have been changed to fit needs of SO personnel without fully considering repeated inputs from the field user. The reasoning was to have one template across the state for all users (fire and resources)with what seemed like little latitude for local needs.

The result of this...this is a prime example when one mistake is made such as omitting a frequency in a template ALL users have that error.

When reviewing frequency groups this past winter, repeated updates from dispatch and Mgt have not been reflected in database.

Suggest that radio code plugs be developed for fire mgt units that allow for the local needs and that they should be set up approved for use and then left alone unless there are changes requiring an update or change be made which will reduce confusion and probability for for something like this to happen in the future.","07/25/2010 00:00"

*This frequency needs to be taken out of the national gather contract (if it's truly in there).

*Frequencies for special events such as these should be requested and assigned by the frequency coordinator to ensure no impacts to fire suppression. They should order frequencies as needed like everyone else.

*This frequency is not authorized for use other than by BLM Nevada as a fire tactical channel. It should not be used, especially during fire season, and definitely not in other states.","07/09/2010 00:00"

The chase truck was a 3/4 ton chevy truck which was fully loaded with gear and equipment in the back. The truck had just reached the hand line where the burn out operation was to take place at about 1300 hours when its right rear drivers side tire went flat. They pulled past the hand line about 50 feet and parked on the firing side of the road.

The FFT1 who was in charge assessed the situation and told his crew members to loosen the lug nuts while he placed the jack from the truck and started to jack the truck up with the factory jack. He soon realized that the ground was soft and the small bottle jack that came with the truck was not going to be able to lift the truck up with the load and the soft soil. The FFT1 then got a bottle jack from the engine to help with raising up the axle. He used both jacks raising one and then the other on the axle. The factory jack was the safety jack and the bottle jack did the work of raising the truck up. The FFT1 raised the truck high enough to be able to take the flat tire off which he told his crew to do. They then realized that the axle was not high enough to put the new tire on. At this point the FFT1 decided to crawl back under the truck and jack the truck up some more. He did not feel comfortable being under the truck so he layed down on the ground and only put enough of his body under the truck to reach the jack. At this point when he started to raise the truck further the axle slipped off of both jacks and fell to the ground. The FFT1 escaped with only a small bruise on the shoulder where the body of the truck came in contact with his shoulder almost pinning him under it.","On 7/11/2010 an AAR was done with the IC, Operations Section Chief, The Safety Officer, the FFT1, and two of the FFT1's supervisors one of which was present when the accident happened.

What was planned?

Change a flat tire on the drivers side rear of the chase truck.

What actually Happened?

While changing the tire it fell off the jacks and almost smashed the FFT1 using the jacks.

Why did it Happen?

FFT1 felt rushed because the burn out operations were waiting on them to finish before starting even though no one was rushing them.

The truck was not chocked

The FFT1 was not familiar with the factory jack that came with the truck and was not using the long handle that comes with it.

The factory jack is not designed to use in the dirt it has a very small base on it.

No base was used to support the jacks to give them more surface area on the ground.

No blocks (ie. Jack-Stands) were used to secure the truck as it was being jacked up.

What can we do next time?

Ensure everyone has reviewed the process for changing a tire and knows how to use the tools available on the vehicle.

Get a larger jack with a larger base because the factory jack on this vehicle was not designed to use in the dirt.

Chock the truck before starting to jack it up.    A root cause anaylsis will be conducted on the near miss and coordinating with the Grand Canyon Safety office to do a lessons learned.

Looking at the standard equipment for changing tires in vehicles to see if more appropriate equipment can be found.

Ensuring that pre season training on tire changing is done on both hard surfaces and dirt or soft surfaces.","07/13/2010 00:00"

Having operated the saws according to our level of training we felt comfortable to run the saws until we noticed a problem with the throttles.

One type 1 crew was assigned to ignition and holding (5 ignitors with 1 Ground FIRB--remaining crewmembers/overhead holding). The other type 1 crew was assigned to hold behind the first IHC.

The plan was to send ignitors around a ridge from a west/northwest facing slope to an east facing slope burning from mid-slope down to a creek. This operation was to be performed in tandem with a helitorch burning the upper portion. The hand ignition began mid slope while aerial platform burned out of view of the ground operation. This worked well for 3/4 of the operation until the helicopter flew down, dropping fire, within 100 feet of the upper-most ignitor.

Ground personnel moved quickly to avoid the fire from the helitorch and successfully avoided injury. Communication with the helicopter was not established with the immediate ground forces. The division supervisor advised the helicopter to move away from the area and the ground ignition commenced with a successful outcome.

Issues:

Discrete aerial ignition frequency was listed in the aerial operation plan but not in the communication plan in the day's IAP.

Helicopters are working on both air-to-ground as well as a special ignition frequency. Two air-to-ground missions were running concurrently (bucket work in adjacent division and ignition in this divsion).

Communication with the helicopter and ground Firing Boss/Holding Boss was not established--communications with the helicopter during and directly after the incident with potential did not involve ground FIRB or ground ignition/holding personnel.

Helicopter/helitorch dropped too low in a drainage that held 40 firefighters.

Ground ignition/holding crew did not have the discrete aerial ignition frequency in hand-held radios.","I filed a safenet

The ground crew had and maintained good situational awareness and acted appropriately during this incident with potential.

The crew has an after action review scheduled for 7/1

The Rocky Mountain Area IMT Operations and Safety both spoke with me about what happened and brainstormed possible ways to prevent future incidents with potential like this.    The parties involved with this SAFENET are commended for dealing with the issue immediately at the local level and then submitting the SAFENET for use in trend tracking.

This SAFENET will be used by the NPS representative to the Aerial Ignition Working Group in review of the Aerial Ignition Guide to ensure direction in the Guide reduces chances of this type of incident in the future.

The following items should be given consideration when conducting a firing operation such as described in this SAFENET:

·	When simultaneous ground and aerial ignitions are taking place the ground crews need to have a discrete freq available to coordinate both operations safely.

·	This frequency should not be the same as that being used by other ongoing operations.

·	Consider a separate break out briefing with the Ops, DIVS, FIRBs and the holding resources to ensure the communications, plans, and trigger points are established before operations begin to ensure everyone's safety, including the helicopter.

·	Ensure there is a clear chain of command in regards to who is in charge of the overall firing operation.","06/30/2010 00:00"

Beginning last fall, the forest started transitioning over to new repeaters and all new frequencies. Since that time, we have continuously had poor radio communication with dispatch as well as occasionally between resources on the forest. With the new frequencies and the change in repeaters, we now have a linked repeater system. In the past when transmitting, one was able to tell if the transmission went through by listening for a 'tail' at the end of the transmission. Now there is no way of knowing whether the radio is hitting the repeaters or not. Frequently we transmit a message to dispatch and then wait in vain for a response. At times they have not heard us at all, and at other times dispatch answers but the transmission doesn't come through. Also when dispatch transmits it is frequently scratchy, unreadable, and the first part of the transmission on most of the repeaters is cut off. Whenever resources are transmitting on the districts we are able to hear each other fine the majority of the time, but dispatch is constantly asking them to repeat themselves or their unit identifier or not answering them at all. Resources communicating with each other on the districts seem to have little or no problem, which leads me to believe the problem may mainly be with the system at dispatch or somewhere in between.

These problems are a safety concern at the very least during day to day operations; however we are now in the middle of our fire season here. In the last two months we have had numerous fires on the forest and the radio problems are a major safety and situational awareness problem at those times. At least twice in the last month alone, we have had multiple fire starts on the districts and the associated ensuing chaos, compounded by the radio issues has raised the safety issue to unacceptable levels. Not only is valuable time lost by ICs and resources trying to communicate with dispatch with fire size-ups, weather information and additional resource needs, additionally inbound resources to the fire and the line and duty officers are unable to hear what is going on at the incidents, which is a major barrier to situational awareness, readiness and safety. Fire resources are not the only ones affected by the comm problems, according to the forest communications plan, all field going resources are required to check in and check out in order to be able to track the location and safety of resources in case problems should arise in which they are in need of assistance. The poor communication also affects these units as well. In addition to resources on the ground, our air resources have had problems with the communication network leading to serious issues communicating with ground resources and dispatch and increasing exposure times to everyone involved while time is wasted trying to troubleshoot the problems.

As a result of the problems listed above, the radio technicians and contractors have been working continuously on the radio system, however the underlying chronic problem has not been fixed by their 'band-aids' and the system as a whole is in need of improvement and/or replacement. It is a daily problem; if one thing is working, another is not. As an agency we preach safety and a big part of that is communications. resources in the field expected to do their jobs as safely as possible need a reliable communication system in order to do that. As with any complex system, we do not expect to have totally trouble-free communication all the time. However, in the last 12+ years that I have been on the forest, this is the worst that I personally have seen it.","I have communicated my concerns with my district AFMO, FMO, District Ranger and our Forest AFMO as well as others. All of them have agreed with me that we have a problem, but as to whether anything is being done about it or not, I cannot say. Frequently I am told 'we know there is a problem and they are working on it.' The issue of communication is brought up by me, other engine captains, and other resources as a concern at every AAR and I personally voiced my concerns during our readiness review and my intention to file this SAFENET. I know our forest radio technicians are aware of the problem and I also know they have possible solutions. However, I do not know if they are getting the support they need to fix the problem.

A re-evaluation of the radio system on the forest needs to be made and a good solution needs to be found to correct the problem. Also as new systems are implemented, there needs to be better training and instruction as to what has been changed so everyone knows how to operate the systems; that includes dispatchers and the personnel in the field who will be using the system. Inexperience with the new system may be one of the contributing factors to the problem; therefore it may also be helpful for everyone involved if we 'cross trained.' Have dispatchers come up on the districts and listen to the radio traffic from our side and vice versa so we can better understand where the breakdowns are occurring.

Whatever solutions need to be implemented, it may be necessary to bring in more agency personnel to assist our radio techs in order to get the problems fixed and perhaps even bring some new perspectives and ideas to the situtation. A field team that can drive around the forest and find the trouble spots or identify if it is more widespread and try to recreate the problems we have in the field may also be beneficial.","06/30/2010 00:00"

The EMT controlling the patient flew with the individual to a medical center ~9 minutes away in Scottsdale, AZ.

The patient was treated for dehydration and heat exhaustion, with on scene symptoms indicative of heat stroke. The medical facility tested the victim for Rhabdomylosis without prompt and all tests cleared prior to releasing the victim.","Transport and treatment of the individual on scene was done in a timely and safe manner. Fire personnel, incident management and other individuals all aided in arranging a seamless transport of the victim to the Scottsdale medical facility.

Corrective actions:

•REITERATE THE NEED TO STAY HYDRATED. Water should be supplemented with Gatorade and other electrolyte supplements such as EmergenC. Temperatures preceding and during this event were in excess of 100 degrees. At least 2.5 gallons of water a day should be consumed while working in these environments.

•Further research found that the victim had taken over-the-counter pain medication with caffeine and acetaminophen which may have further contributed to his dehydration. Be cognizant of the effects of over-the-counter medicine as it pertains to hydration.

•Development of a last resort collapsible victim transport device is being considered and in development by personnel at the fire. A lightweight, cordura transport unit will expedite transport for non-cervical spine related injuries.","06/29/2010 00:00"

While securing this section of handline that the the crew had put in the previous shift an area of concern was recognized. Two of the crews saw teams were working in advance of the crew mitigating snag hazards and isolating any heat that presented control issues. This particular area of concern had some active backing ground fire in an area where it could extend to other fuels and become a control problem due to its proximity to the control line. It was decided by one saw team that they would keep the fire from extending into the adjacent fuels and causing a further control issue and at the same time the other saw team was evaluating a group of hazard trees also in close proximity to this same area. These hazard trees were Aspen snags that the crew had identified in the previous shifts as having a significant potential for failure if the winds were to pick up or if they were fire weakened. During the short period of time that the first saw team started to brush out the area and the second saw team started to evaluate what measures needed to be taken to mitagate any potential hazards from the Aspen snags, one of the snags came down. A portion of this snag that came down came very close to striking the swamper of the saw team working in the area. This incident was witnessed by the swamper of the saw team sizing up the snags, this incident left the employee who witnessed this event in such a state that upon returning to the home unit they requested to resign their position.","Standard operating proceedures on any incident are to recieve an operational briefing and identify the major hazards and risks that the crew will be exposed to. This had been done for this shift as well as the previous shifts on the Divs. Snag safety had been identified as one of the larger concerns on the Divs. that day due to the fuel type(mixed conifer/aspen)and the length of time the fire had been burning in the area. After Action Review of every shift is the standard operating proceedure of the crew, this shift, this event and snag safety have all been discussed thoroughly by the entire crew and more specifically the crewmembers directly involved. I believe that all mitigating actions had taken place for the shift that day, and it is the crews belief that we are able to recognize when snag safety issues are a concern and take the corrective actions neccessary to operate as safely and effectively as possible. The crew will continue to make snag safety a key topic of discussion both in pre-operational safety briefings as well as AAR's and will dilligently work to mitigate all snag hazard concerns in our work areas.","07/01/2010 00:00"

The only personnel there were the camp crew and the facilities unit leader since the camp was just being established. I checked to see if the communications starter kit had arrived. It had not. I put up my tent and went to bed. At 2300 hours I was awakened and told the starter kit had arrived. I went over and helped unload and check in the kit. The manifest and the kit inventory were missing.

I went back to bed. At 0430 I got up and went over to check the starter kit and the comm trailer. At 0600 the first RADO arrived and we proceeded to set up communications. At 0630 other personnel arrived and proceded to hold briefing. I let the RADO speak at briefing because he was local personnel from the team. Later we discussed the upcoming situations and proceded to plan out the deployment of the equipment with the maps we could find. Later that day, the com tech arrived and we decided where the best spots were to put the repeater. Then we were told we had to move camp. We proceded to move camp to the Alpine elementary school approximately 15 miles from the previous camp. We set up communications under a covered patio at the far end of the school building and re-assessed the area for the repeater because of the change of camp location to the fire. The RADO and tech left to install the command repeater on the mountain. Later another repeater arrived. (I don't know who ordered the repeater.) Later when the RADO and tech arrived back in camp we discussed where to install the new repeater. We decided to put the repeater on a peak above the camp along with the Log repeater. The coverage was almost perfect except at one drop point located in the bottom of a canyon on one of the highways. I suggested using human repeaters until we could solve the problem. I was told by Ops we didn't have the personnel yet to use as human repeaters. We decided to order another repeater to put up to cover the area not covered by the others. I ordered the repeater and another kit of command and log radios, then I proceeded to order phones for the camp which the local telecom installed the next day. We were informed that the COMC ordered another COML to find out why we needed all the equipment we were ordering. (I found out later there had been another repeater ordered by someone in camp that I wasn't told of.)

The next day the other COML arrived and proceded to acquaint himself with the situation. He then suggested we move the first repeater to another location and order another repeater to cover the dead area. I suggested instead to order 2 crossband radio kits and put across the canyon in question so the handhelds could reach the repeaters from the canyon. I heard nothing more of this suggestion. Then chaos fell. The COML started communicating between the Log chief and other communication personnel and instead of making suggestions, commanding that things be done without my input, essentially taking over. When we set up the clone radios, one of the programs were left in wide mode and I didn't catch it. Then when the 205 was printed there were typos on it that I didn't catch. With these problems I requested demob and left.","","07/02/2010 00:00"

The weather was 80 degrees, r.h. in the 10% range, and winds from the southwest at 15-20 mph, gusting to 35 mph, fuels were ponderosa pine and mixed conifer. A member of the district management was conferring with two other overhead individuals at the junction of FR 556, and FR 420. There were multiple spots in the area. A flare up dictated that these three individuals needed to leave the area, and follow what all three viewed as the escape route heading north on FR 420. As the three individuals each in their own vehicle headed north to avoid the flare up their escape route had been compromised by additional spot fires, and they were forced to drive through the spot fires to reach a safe area. These spot fires were rapidly crowning and running and this resulted in the reason for this document, as the escape route had been compromised without their knowledge and presented an unsafe escape route.","I am filling out this form hopefully to provide a heads up for future fires and promote better attention to safety in the future.

This fire was growing rapidly, and hence LCES was changing very rapidly. In fire environments LCES is not static and we should have been more aware of the changing situation.

Air Attack was over the fire however could not help determine this issue due to visibility from smoke.

The Schultz Fire while becoming very active a determination of which way the fire wanted to run was hard to determine with the amount of spotting that was present. The escape route north on FR 420 was in line with the direction the fire wanted to go, and while little options were available this in hind sight may not have been the best excape route.

I had just driven the 420 road no more than 5 minutes prior to our escape and the road did provide a safe escape route, again things were changing fast, and our situation awareness, and LCES did not keep pace with the fire.","06/29/2010 00:00"

I had been released from a fire on the Kaibab NF west of Flagstaff and was just returning to town when I overheard air attack reporting this new start and drove up on the fire in less than 1 minute from the time air attack had contacted FDC. I contacted FDC and gave a size up( fire is a couple miles west of your dispatch center just south of Highway 66, 1/10th acre active on all sides, need engines and aircraft)and assumed 'Ranch IC'. I was advised there was an air atttack overhead and contact with AA was made on the Coconino NF primary frequency. I was advised 2 helitankers were inbound with a 5 minute ETA. AA initially wanted me to coordinate the drops thru him rather than going direct with the aircraft on the air to ground frequency which tied up the Coconino's main fire channel for a few minutes but was rectified with the coordination of the aircraft using the A/G frequency.

He stated that he was not experiencing chest pain at the time he informed his captain. A call was placed to the supervisor to inform him and ascertain wishes for seeking treatment. It was determined that the individual would be taken to Mesquite to see a doctor. The firefighter was transported to the hospital. When at the hospital in Mesquite, NV, the doctors ran several tests to determine the cause of the chest pains. Upon the initial test, there was some indication that the firefighter had suffered a heart attack. To err on the side of cuation, the physician in Mesquite had him transported to a Las Vegas hospital that had a cardiologist on staff. The night of June 2nd, the Las Vegas Valley hospital ran further tests and decided to admit the firefighter overnight for observations. The following day, June 3, a cardiologist saw him and had determined that he had indeed suffered a heart attack, and scheduled some other medical test. On June 4, the doctor performed an angiogram and angioplasty. It was determined from this procedure that there was some blockage in the arteries and two stints were placed in the artery and the blockages were removed. He was held over for observation until June 21. He was released from the hospital June 22 and is awaiting approval from the doctor to return to work.","Due to the severity of this injury, it has been discussed with all of the Southern Nevada fire staff and personnel to treat any and every injury with the utmost care. The disappointing fact about this action is that the individual involved didn't realize the severity of his injury. This firefighter is a fairly young individual and is in good shape. Previous to working as a federal wildland firefighter, he was active military and had plenty of experience with hard physical labor. He said that he had noticed some discomfort in his chest for at least 2 weeks previous to him seeking medical attention. He described his symptoms as a slight pain in his chest that would disappear about 30 minutes after he was done PT-ing. He first thought that it may have been possible dehydration, possible acid reflux or heartburn of some sort, or trying to adapt to a desert climate in southern Nevada. His last concern was that he had suffered a heart attack. This injury just reiterates the fact to treat each and every injury seriously and to not hesitate in seeking medical help immediately. Also, a note to all those who supervise firefighters: pay extra attention to our folks. For whatever reason, I believe that there are sometimes people that we supervise that are not always quite honest in telling os the severity of ones injury or possible injury, and that we all think it will disappear over time.

As the discussion progressed it came out that the plan that had been outlined the evening before that everyone had agreed to had been changed by the IC that morning at the last minute. He made the change without talking to OPS or the DIVS's or soliciting their input. The new plan was not clear or understood by mid-level leaders and was conveyed directly to the shot crews by the IC and no one else. The plan led to the crews entering an area of unexploded ordinance that had been previously identified and decided that the area should not be entered and the tactic not used.

When people were talking about who should deal with the issue it came out that the IAP had 2 people assigned as a DIVS on the same division. And a map that was produced for the same day's work showed a different DIVS and one of the IAP DIVS's as a TFLD in the division. The result was no one knew for sure who was in charge of the division and who was making the decisions.

Also, OPS made the comment that the IC was not using him as OPS, and most of the strategy and tactical decisions were not going through him. Additionally, he was not being consulted on most of the strategy and tactical decisions which resulted in him being left in the dark about what the plan was for the day.

The result was confusion on the line, confusion among single resource bosses, confusion and doubt among mid-level supervisors and few people being clear on strategy and/or tactics.","I encouraged OPS to discuss the situation with the IC but he indicated that this was this IC's 'style'.

The repeater that was being used for the incident was ASFD State repeater 3, which was marginal at best. The Greenwood repeater is vital to assure safe communications in areas that neither State repeater 3 or Hayden will reach. Field resources were unable to communicate with Dispatch at the incident.

The Hayden repeater which is the primary BLM repeater for the northern end of the BLM Colorado River District, was out of service for most of this past winter and was recently visited by communications personnel. The Hayden repeater itself appears to be functioning at this time; however, during the Robison and the Sunset incidents last weekend, the (2) repeaters were directly affecting each other as each incident was communicating with dispatch. Dispatch was unable to copy radio traffic from either incident as transmissions were being conducted simultaneously.

Holiday weekends, such as this past Memorial Day, experience very heavy use on the trail, as well as camping along its corridor. Over Memorial Day weekend Forest Service LEO’s and FPO’s were involved in conducting patrols and compliance checks along ‘the pipeline’ trail. While on the trail, resources utilized the Archibald repeater to communicate as we were spread too far apart to use a point-to-point simplex frequency such as COM 1. Cell phone coverage in the area was essentially non-existent. During the afternoon of Sunday, May 30th, the West zone of the Forest experienced a small initial attack fire. The East and West Zones of the Forest are geographically separated with Dispatch somewhat centrally located between them. Each Repeater on the West Zone shares a tone with a Repeater on the East Zone. Willow Repeater was being utilized on the initial attack fire and Archibald Repeater by Law Enforcement operations on the East Zone. Willow and Archibald use the same tone therefore transmissions on both repeaters were ‘walking’ on each other causing confusion and problems in Dispatch. Dispatch requested that the Law Enforcement resources working ‘the pipeline’ stay off the repeater and switch to COM 1. Switching to any simplex point to point frequency was impossible as resources were spread out along an approximately 15 mile segment of trail. While minimizing radio traffic while there are ongoing incidents is SOP, it is unrealistic to expect that all other operations on the Forest will cease using the radio system when there is one ongoing fire. Resources being unable to use the radio system is a serious safety issue that comes up every time there is a fire on this Forest.","Upgrade the radio system and/or make each repeater a separate tone to minimize radio traffic being covered by other transmissions on the other Zone.","06/03/2010 00:00"

It was the beginning of the radio replacement on the Forest to convert to Narrowbanding.

As of 5/25/2010, we have minimal communications with field units on the Monterey and Ojai Ranger District. Radio transmissions are static and volume is low.

Forest wide it takes a dispatcher 3-5 attempts to locate who is calling, their radio call sign, and make out their transmission. Once more, volumnes are low and static is high covering their radio traffic.

When simulcasting, a loud hum dominates the radio transmissions making it difficult to hear units.

5/25/2010 We just had a vegetation fire response with a cooperator and attempted to tone out resources with the simulcasting on Forest Net and were unsuccessful. We then attempted to respond them without the simulcast on Forest Net, still no response. We then went to the Service Net Backup system and responded them and we were successful. The resources we are responding are across town from us!

5/25/2010 _____55? (can't make out the unit) is calling us on Sisar Forest Net. Between 6 dispatchers we can not make out their traffic. Something about needing CHP on Hwy. 33. We notified CHP in the blind requesting they send a unit up 33 and search for our Forest Service unit = unknown circumstances!

5/23/2010 With the present radio system, we have 2 motorcycle accidents with 2 medivac helicopters in route (we are flight following) and a Law Enforcement Officer (Sheriff) calling us with 2 subjects at gun point needing backup Code 3!

Forest Wide, multiple phone calls have been received this am from units advising they have been trying to contact us on the radio and we are not answering. We then perform radio checks with them and are incapable of hearing them on the radio. Both Forest and Service Net, both on the primary and backup systems.

5/24/10 Service Net access was on the backup radio system, and Forest Net was on Primary Radio System. On 5/25/10 it is reversed. When units are calling in, we have to check both systems to attempt to return their call because the system in interminent. This increases the number of attempts to get ahold of a unit from 3-5 to 5-8 attempts.

The first identified problem was lost functionality in the dispatch center which was reported 5/6/10 with additional identified issues on 5/11/10. Issues were documented and elivated to the Forest and Province Radio Techs. Issues are/were as follows:

We use to be able to touch a hilltop icon and transmit but we can no longer do this. We have to hit 'select', hit 'Forest or Service Net' the hit 'hilltop name' before we can transmit. This is a huge impact to the daily radio traffic. Here is an example of how we use to use it: 7E4 request 10-27/29 on Service Net LaCumbre. The dispatcher is listening to his request when Rec 73 calls Los Padres over Service Net Frazier. Dispatcher would normally keep the traffic with 7E4 selected up, and quickly touch the 'Frazier Hilltop Icon' and ask Rec 73 to stand by. Now they have to hit 'select', hit 'Service Net', hit 'Frazier' tell Rec 73 to Standby, then hit 'select', hit 'Service Net', hit 'LaCumbre'. To many steps, escpecially when there is a increase in traffic in the field. It was explained when the new system was installed it was with 2 channels (Forest Net and Servuce Net)while the old system had a dedicated channel to each hilltop which is what allowed us to operate the way we did in the past.

Major changes to the 'select' and 'unselect' speakers/headset. We use to hear all traffic on the unselect speaker, and when we wanted to specifically hear a unit on a specific hill top select it and only their traffic would be heard on the select speaker or in the earpeice of the headset. The way the system is designed now, if nothing is selected you hear all traffic over the unselect speaker (no change = good). But the minute you select either Forest or Service Net, nothing comes out of the unselect speaker at all. If you select Service Net, then all traffic for Service Net goes through the headset. Even if you select a specific hill top, all traffic for Service Net goes through the headset so if your trying to specifically hear a unit on a specific hilltop, you can no longer fine tune hearing the traffic. In addition, when your selected on Service Net, hearing only Service net traffic on your headset, no traffic from Forest Net can be heard at all, not even on the unselect speaker. Once more this is because the new system only has 2 channels (Forest Net and Service Net)and not a dedicated channel for each hilltop.

The audible sound has decreased by about 30 percent. In addition to the challenge of determining who may be calling us and on what hilltop, the volumn is lower and we are missing calls. In addition, there is a increase in static over all hilltops which adds to the challenge of getting the radio calls.

Mexican traffic is increasing and causing havic during incidents. I don't believe the field can hear it, and our phone calls into the ECC are increasing telling us that people are calling us and we are not answering. (SITUATION RESOLVED)

The present display on the touch screen moducom monitors is not the design we previously had. It has been redesigned in a numerical order by tone 1, 2, 3 etc. Previously we had the hilltops placed in a north to south which coincided with radio call signs, districts, business forms/practices, and assisted new dispatchers, detailers etc. in narrowing down which hilltops where the option to choose from based on the radio call sign of the unit.

We have lost the display of seeing which hilltops are being triggered so that it helps the dispatchers narrow down who is calling us and from what location.

As we near the busier season, I need to understand how soon we will get these features corrected and what it is going to take to make this happen. Will some of the hardware installs help resolve these new problems? I'd like to see our functionality restored asap! I'm concerned with the fire resources coming on line, increase of LE&I activity, the increase of public access onto the forest (spring/summer activity), the stimulous dollars received by recreation has increased there radio traffic tremendously and I'm concerned that our operation and field safety will be impacted.

Memorial Weekend is upon us and we have been forced to address employee and officer safety issues that we will be faced with this weekend. We are drafting a plan on how to deal with this weekend. We are considering the use of the Forest Lightning Plan as a mode of operation, standing down certain operations such as LE&I, discontinue daily broadcast such as line-up, weather, indices etc., Request all field going units go in service via fax or phone, and minimize radio traffic to emergency traffic only.

The above will address this weekend, but we need to address how we will operate in the near future.","5/25/2010 CIO Service Request Ticket #10052200090 elivated from a category 2 to a category 1.

It was brought to our attention that the AC must be on cool. Over the weekend, with the amount of IA activity, the dispatch gets extremely hot and impacts the electronics and the dispatchers.

On May 23, 2010, a maintenance person was in to change the filters and noted that the fan for teh AC in the dispatch room was not operational. He stated that he would report it.  It was stated that the owner of the building is aware of the issue and will be sending someone to check it out.

This is a recurring issue, in the winter we had no heat and space heaters were placed around the room to supplement the temperature. We wore coats and gloves to work. Our temps had dipped down to 45-50 degrees while today May 23, 2010, the temprature has reached 90 degrees, with floor fans to help circulate the air. This type of heat is not healthy for dispatchers who need to stay alert and be amiable on the radio.

OSHA regualtions state the following:

'SUBJECT: OSHA Policy on Indoor Air Quality: Office Temperature/Humidity and Environmental Tobacco Smoke

Office Temperature/Humidity

As a general rule, office temperature and humidity are matters of human comfort. OSHA has no regulations specifically addressing temperature and humidity in an office setting. However, Section III, Chapter 2, Subsection V of the OSHA Technical Manual, 'Recommendations for the Employer,' provides engineering and administrative guidance to prevent or alleviate indoor air quality problems. Air treatment is defined under the engineering recommendations as, 'the removal of air contaminants and/or the control of room temperature and humidity.' OSHA recommends temperature control in the range of 68-76° F and humidity control in the range of 20%-60%. '

Operations are 24/7 and require mitigation for resources working the weekend as well as during the week. This also does not add the the moral of those working. Studies have shown that heat related issues can add to employee stress and negatively impact productivity and morale.","Kestral readings taken on scene show the current temp is 89 degrees and 56 % RH in the dispatching office. Fan are being utilized to circulate warm air around the room, windows have been opened, and windows along side the building exposures facing the sun have been closed and the blinds drawn. Dispatchers were reminded to take breaks and walk down the hall to retrieve cold water and stay hydrated. Cadillac airport reports 86 degrees outside, an RH of 59% and a heat index of 91 degrees. Consideration to coop operations has been suggested and however, the server room and the plotter room are considerably colder than the rest of the building year round because of the equipment located in those rooms. The same consideraiton needs to be made for the amount of electronic equipment used for dispatching. The fans also create the potential for a tripping hazard. It might be helpful for the dispatch to purchase portable air conditioning units for the room to mitigate this on-going issue.","05/24/2010 00:00"

Activity - Prescribed burn in Timber Litter with moderate fuel loading. The illness occured on the second day after ignitions had ceased.

Environmental conditions - Temperatures were in the mid 60's, RH in the upper teens, SSW winds 2-5 mph, sky was mostly clear, light residual smoke in the area with primarily 1000 hr. fuels being consumed in the interior with occasional creep in the duff.

Event - On 5/19/2010, firefighters on a local handcrew were working a section of line to secure the perimeter. Smoke was light and the environmental working conditions were relatively mild. Two days prior to the incident, the crew had been intermittenly exposed to fairly heavy smoke form the burn. Fire personnel had access to freash air routinely throughout the day.

At 1200 hrs, one of the firefighters stated that they were having difficulty breathing and that they were not feeling very well. An EMT on the crew performed and assessment on the individual. At that time there was no significant indicators that expressed an immediate danger to the individual. However, the decision was made to take the individual off the line to Propect Tank which was the primary staging area, safety zone and landing zone for mediacl air evacuations.

The fire dispatch office was notified of the situation and a request for transport of the individual back to the fire station in Peach Springs was made (approximately a 1 1/2 hr drive). Enroute to the staging area, the ill firefighters' condition worsened. Upon arrival at the staging area (1230 hrs), the firefighter passed out. At that time, the Burn Boss requested a medical air evacuation.

The fire dispatch office began making arrangements for the air evacuation. Approximately 10 minutes later, fire dispatch notified the Burn Boss that the helicopter should be arriving in approximately 30 minutes. The ill firefighter passed out a total of 2 times and was having difficulty breathing. The Burn Boss traineed arrived on scene at approximately 1315 hrs and assisted with helping the ill firefighter and preparing the helicopter landing zone.

At 1338, the helicopter arrived and was transported to the hospital in Kingman, AZ approximately 30 minutes by air. The firefighter arrived safely at the hospital and tests indicated that the firefighter was suffering from dehydration. The firefighter was treated and released that same evening. The firefighter is resting and recouperating at home.","The fireline EMT was notified immediately of the ill firefighter.

An evaluation was performed by the EMT.

The firefighter was transported to the staging area/helicopter landing zone for further assessment and treatment.

A helicopter was ordered and transported the firefighter to an area hospital for further treatment.

The firefighter was treated for dehydration at the hospital and released that evening.

Actions were taken in accordance with the Medical Plan that was noted in the Burn Plan and Incident Action Plan.    Discussions with agency staff recommends having oxygen available for future remote burns such as this. Also, notifying the air transport vendor of the location of landing zones prior to ignitions, of a burn in the event there is a need for air transport. Water supplies were adequate and briefings covered hydration issues each day. However, firefighters will be encouraged by crew leaders throughout each operational period to ensure that each firefighter is receiveing adequate quantities of fluids.","05/21/2010 00:00"

The broadcast would only occur for approximately 10 seconds and repeated itself every half hour at 19 and 49 minutes past the hour. This channel serves as the primary tactical frequency assigned to the BLM in this District. Several federal and local cooperators have this frequency implemented in their communications plan to ensure proper communication abilities on incidents. The BLM in this area has a strong interagency and cooperator support and assistance environment. This interference would have a significant impact on safe communications during times of high fire operations related radio traffic.","I reported this odd broadcast to the lead telecommunications technician located at the Lander BLM Field Office. The radio technician said he would look into it. After contacting the BLM National Radio Communication Division in Boise, it was determined the frequency had been assigned to a local cooperator by the Department of Interior. The transmissions being heard were the identifier staking claim to the frequency. The frequency was no longer licensed to the BLM and could no longer be utilized, effectively immediately. An interference report was sent to the Boise Radio shop and there it will be forwarded on to the DOI frequency manager. While waiting for a resolution the local BLM District has implemented a plan to share a BLM administrative simplex channel to cover our tactical communication needs. This has caused significant coordinating efforts late in the spring, impacting operations in a negative fashion.

Local BLM telecommunications personnel report there is a significant back log of frequency requests and licensing at the national level. This has been manifested this spring of 2010 with multiple frequency issuance conflicts. Recently, a rocky Mountain Area regional Air to Ground frequency plan had to be released three times to resolve conflicts found due to double issuance of frequencies, similar to what occurred in the Wind River/Big Horn Basin District with our tactical frequency (see Safenet # 83UPZKSAFE, 3/22/10). Similar occurrences took place in 2009 with the repeated reissuance of the Air to Ground frequency plan. In short, I find it very troubling that the field has had several instances of the double issuance of frequencies.    An interference report was collaboratively drafted with the Wind River/Big Horn Basin District and the Lander Radio Technician. This report was received at the Department of Interior. The DOI then took steps to “reassign” the tactical frequency back to the District. The resolution time was shorter than anticipated and the outcome satisfactory.","05/13/2010 00:00"

The burn boss assessed the wind situation and possible outcomes and called by radio to the Cody Interagency Dispatch Center to check on the availability of a helicopter for contingency measures. Communications from the dispatch center were failing to the field units, but earlier in the day communications had worked with Dispatch. A F.S. communications technician was working in the area, approximately 1400 hrs. and overheard the problems. The comm tech initiated measures to trouble shoot the radio system. The problem was determined to likely be a 'network' problem and a work ticket was submitted. The comm tech could not access the 'network' side of the system to assess the situation. It took a few hours to restore the sytem to a functional capability by the network managers.

The repair process and security protocols of the Forest Service 'network' system exclude the comm tech from accessing and repairing the network. This is a problem. During the incident, the fire did not escape and no firefighters were injured. However, if contingency resources needed to be activated and communicated with, the LCES systems was not intact. Also of note is that if a injury had occured, getting care and coordinating care would have been very difficult.

This problem could happen again. There is no backup system in this district to be activated to communicate with the Dispatch Center. This is a problem. The local unit has been requesting assistance to resolve access issues on a nearby site to get a backup system installed. This backup system would mitigate the network failure issues with the Dispatch Center.

Network system access and property and equipment access issues need to be resolved.","Several actions by different individuals have occurred to recognize this problem.

Communications Technician- This person is currently working on fixing network issues in the Wind River and Washakie Districts of the Forest. The problems are occuring at unit offices as well as the Dispatch Center. Work tickets are being submitted.

Zone FMO - Conducted AAR on problem with personnel involved at the field level and reported AAR results unit wide. During Forest annual spring fire meeting the problem was announced to all units verbally.

An extra back up system and relay system will have to be planned for prescribed and wildfire activities in the South Zone Districts.

Forest FMO/AFFMO - Determined a SAFENET should be filed as the network access and repair processes need to be user friendly to the communication technicians in the field. Also, Gaining access to a key communications site for a backup system has been elevated for further support at the regional level. Fixing this system for Forestwide activities is prioritized. Radio sytem failure is regarded as a near miss by the fire staff.    Satellite phone use was reviewed as a backup system, however the field units in that area noted that has been tried with limited success. A mini dispatch or relay system will have to be set up in the interim if this problem occurs again. The communications technician and districts continue to resolve the 'network' side of the radio system by working through established procedures.

Long term resolution includes the installation of a backup system that can be activated quickly to communicate with the dispatch system. That is dependent at this time on accessing a communications site with private access issues.

If the backup system were in place, in would take about three to fifteen minutes to have full functional capability restored. At present, the radio problem fixes could take upto four hours to fix.","05/03/2010 00:00"

When we started looking at the issue with the fleet people, we found that broken spot welds are actually under the cab. We have deturmined that there is a bigger issue than the spot welds being broke (they offer minimal support to the middle seat). It seems that there is no support under the center seat(compared to the outside seats), the center seat is mounted to the cab only. In discussion with our fleet people it seems that with this year of engine (old body style) that when our SCBA seats were installed, there was no consideration of putting a plate or framing of some sort to tie all 3 SCBA seats together. Making the middle seat not as sturdy as the outside 2. We are working with our fleet people to figure out a way to make sure the center seat is propperly supported to the cab. We are looking at having a plate installed under all 3 seats to tie them together to make a better support under the middle seat.

My concern as an IC , if I assign a task to a NPS employee who may show up to an incident, how am I supposed to know if law enforcement officer (they have different fire clothes and carry guns, we don't) is there to investigate the fire, or if he is my IA line fire fighter. I heard at fire refersher that in many fire fatalities (burn overs), that the IC and others were confused about each others roles. I believe this situation will occur at the park and then I will be held liable because I am the IC on a IA fire on the park and I do not know if the park employee is a fire fighter,or a fire investigator. I thought that individuals cannot serve in dual roles. There are several IC's on my unit and I am concerned that if we do not know why, which role they are serving in (LE or FIRE FIGHTER, NOT BOTH) we could end up with accidents. I also heard that you cannot serve in 2 jobs at one time. I heard that NPS LE did actually show up on a fire at the park within the past 2 weeks and put the fire out. I heard that they are do not have red cards to fight fires nor did they have the PPE that is required. I heard the park superentident makes them do it.","The submitted content was removed based upon the established SAFENET Posting Criteria which states, 'SAFENETs that contain unprofessional content (e.g. personal attacks/slander, character defamation) will not be posted, or the offensive comments will be removed and only the safety and health related content will be displayed prior to posting.'     On the fire that occurred on NPS jurisdiction on April 10, 2010 NPS Law Enforcement Rangers performed only Law Enforcement duties in support of wildland firefighters.  

Most of the Law Enforcement staff at the Park are qualified as both SEC1 (Security 1) and FFT2 (Firefighter Level 2) and provided with proper PPE for both positions.  Those that are not currently qualified are pursuing training and certification.

 Local USFS LEO’s are red-carded only for SEC1 functions with no collateral-duty wildland firefighting qualifications.  However, the Forest has provided basic fire training for all LEO’s to maintain unescorted line visits per the Red Book.  

Coronado NF has had existing border fire protocols for operations along the International Border with Mexico and NPS personnel are implementing the same protocols.  These protocols can be found at http://gacc.nifc.gov/swcc/administrative/safety/us_mexico_border/us_mexico_border.htm. 

It has never been practiced nor intended that LEO’s assigned to fires for firefighter security do collateral duties, especially firefighting.  

A previously scheduled meeting on April 16 to discuss the Interagency Operating Plan included discussion to review current LE support on fires.  It is feasible that a misunderstanding resulted from this meeting, confusing a discussion of utilizing firefighter-qualified LEO’s on suppression crews as needed, with an implication that they would be doing both (security and firefighting) concurrently.

Where there is confusion or concern on an LEO’s role and function on a fire, the Incident Commander (IC) has the authority and responsibility to clarify and direct the appropriate role and make that known to all personnel assigned to the fire.  Ensure as the IC you provide clear leader’s intent to the LEO’s as well as all others under your command.

If you, as a firefighter or IC, “hear” something that doesn’t sound right, seek clarification immediately.  Often, concerns and potential safety issues can be cleared up by more thorough discussion and a willingness to seek answers.

Further action:  Ensure that standard protocols and practices are maintained and increase our efforts to improve the quality and frequency of educating internal and external partners.  This education must be prominent at all levels of the fire management organization, from line decision-makers to first-year firefighters.","04/21/2010 00:00"

The spot weather forecast obtained for the day of the burn indicated that the maximum temperature would be 45-50° Fahrenheit, 22-27% minimum RH, and northwest winds 4 to 8 MPH with gusts to 10 MPH. The current and forecasted weather were within the parameters of the burn plan.

Topography: Topography of the project area was moderately steep (30 % slope). The accident occurred in a relatively flat area adjacent to the two-track road in the southern portion of the unit.

Fuel Conditions: Light to heavy dead fuel (juniper) jackpots within sagebrush/grass vegetation dominated the burn unit. Fuel loading within the portion of the unit being burned on May 6 averaged 40-50 tons per acre with a fuel bed depth averaging 2-3 feet. The live fuel moisture of sagebrush was greater than 180 percent. The primary carrier of fire was the dead and down juniper.

What Happened:

1600: The RXB3 noticed development of a vertical vortex just west of their position within a portion of the unit that was actively burning. The vortex grew quickly and began to move rapidly toward their location. The RXB3 told personnel with him to move out of the way as they were directly in the apparent path of the vortex.

The RXB3 and one person jumped in one of the UTVs and drove north away from vortex path, two people jumped in the 2nd UTV and also turn north away from the vortex and made it approximately 100 yards before getting the UTV high-centered on a large rock causing damage to drive train of the UTV rendering it temporarily undriveable. One person chose to move on foot (running) away from the vortex and made it to a small knoll east of the vortex that was not in its path.

The final person jumped into the 3rd UTV and began quickly moving away from the vortex. As the operator was moving away from the danger the UTV hit a rock approximately 45 yards from where he began to evade the vortex. Unable to drive the UTV any further the operator noticed the vortex was coming directly toward him. Two large pieces of debris struck the UTV while the operator was protecting himself in the front seat of the UTV. The vortex continued past the 3rd UTV and operator and moved east for another ¼ mile, away from the personnel and equipment, before dissipating. The RXB3 conducted an assessment of personnel and equipment. No personnel were injured; however two of the three UTVs received damage as a result of the vortex and attempt to escape. The estimated time between the RXB3 noticed the vortex developing to it reaching the accident site was estimated to be approximately 30-45 seconds.","A variety of options were discussed among the group on what they would do differently. The following items were discussed:

•	Change the ignition pattern to limit/reduce heat development;

•	Use fewer burners to reduce exposure to personnel;

•	Utilize lookouts to watch for indications of vertical vortex development;

•	Take more frequent weather observations;

•	Park equipment and stage personnel in locations further away from areas likely to experience vertical vortices development;

•	Take more time prior to ignition to become more familiar with project and conditions; and

•	Participate in the development of project in the planning phase to gain a better understanding of the project and desired outcomes.

Lessons Learned

The group then identified lessons learned from this incident. These included:

•	Vertical vortices can occur at any time when conditions for their development exist. In other words, vertical vortices don’t just happen in the heat of the summer.

•	The heat produced by burning of jackpots of juniper and can influence weather conditions at the site.

•	Implementation personnel need to work more closely with planning personnel to ensure concerns are addressed and all individuals involved have a common understanding of project objectives, safety issues, and implementation procedures.

•	Although a prescribed burn is categorized as having Type 3 complexity does not mean that some elements of a Type 2 or Type 1 prescribed burn complexity don’t exist in the project area.","05/26/2010 00:00"

I made calls to the Albuquerque FD Wildland coordinator who told me he was in route but there were AFD units on scene and sizing up. He would provide updates as he gets them. I then received a call from our inmate work camp supervisor who told me one of his crews was in the area and was requested for initial attack so he needed permission to engage. He said he was requested by the IC so I gave him the go ahead. I found out later that a un-carded individual from the Albuquerque Open Space Division was with the crew and attempting to act as a Division Boss. Our crew boss for our crew used judgment and did not listen to some of the actions by this Open Space individual. The Open Space employee also called me at the office requesting air support when I informed him that I will only talk to the IC or a fire department representative. He told me that this request was from the IC. I told him to have him call me.

This individual is an Ex USFS employee and Ex State Forestry AD but could not (and cannot) produce any training records or Task Books so was not carded by any agency. He also identified himself as an employee from the Albuquerque Open space Division (not AFD).  In a Former conversation with his supervisor this was a self imposed title. He has a Truck with Fire on the back and a light bar. So this can confuse anyone who does not know him.

It is important to understand that AFD does not condone this individual’s action and has also had conversations within the city channels. This should be addressed to the Open Space Division and NOT AFD.

At one point during initial attack this open space employee butted heads with the AFD wildland IC and was holding fussees and threatened to back burn a portion of the line after the IC informed him that back burning was not a tactic being considered at this time. This action would have threatened firefighters on the line that were not expecting a burning operation. It also served to hamper firefighting efforts by making those around him hesitate for their own safety.","He was removed from the fire and told to only serve as a resource advisor and not to return to the line. The AFD Deputy Chief also informed city police as well as Open Space police to detain him if he was found on the line. We informed our crews that they should use caution when this individual is in the area and to disengage and inform the IC and Security.

Prior to this incident I met with the Open Space Director about this individual and it was confirmed that Albuquerque Open Space is not and does not intend to be a fire agency. He told me that he intends on having this individual remove any fire related insignia and equipment from the Open Space vehicle.

We are very concerned that a un-carded and un qualified person continues to use agency resources to convey a fire responsibility. This person’s action served to endanger the front line personnel by his actions.","04/06/2010 00:00"

The crew member stepped backwards into a stump hole while he was mopping up the fire and burned his right calf. The crew member was evaluated on site by Fire Paramedics and determined the burn was a second degree burn. The patient was transported from the fire site to Palo Verde Hospital in Blythe, California at 12:26 for further evaluation. The individual will be transported to the Maricopa Burn Center in Phoenix, Arizona, after he was evaluated at Palo Verde Hospital ER. The Incident Commander and Crew Boss will remain with the crew member throughout the medical process.

The injury occurred on the Mitchell Fire on the Yuma Field Office Lands located just southwest of the Oxbow Campgrounds. The Oxbow campgrounds are located approximately 2 miles south of Palo Verde, Ca, and approximately 20 miles south of Blythe, CA, on the Colorado River.

The firefighter was wearing standard 8 inch height leather boots with Vibram soles. He was equipped with standard GSA nomex green pants, which had the drawstring tied at the ankle. The firefighter also had on Nomex shirt, hard hat, leather gloves, hard hat, and IA pack.

Fire behavior, at the time of the incident, was a smoldering fire.","The action taken to prevent this injury was in the morning the IC brief the crew with the Colorado River Firefighting Mitigation Measures Safety Briefing Card. Brief card included duff layer, machine piles, and many other associated hazards unique to the area.

After the injury, IC transitioned with ICT 3. ICT 3 was informed by the duty officer to pull all crew members out of the black and to only mop up from the control lines. Mitigation measures were to decrease the likely hood of further injures on this assignment. Resources were advised to monitor and only take action with equipment (Cat D-5) to minimize their exposure.    Agency corrective action will be to review the Colorado River Firefighting Mitigation Measures Safety Briefing Card. On March 31, 2010, during a conference call with NIFC, Bureau of Indian Affairs Western Regional Office, Bureau of Land Management Arizona State Office, and the Colorado River District, all agencies agreed to work to develop an Interagency River Firefighting Mitigation Measures Safety Briefing Card.

Beginning last fall the forest Wave Radio license expired. Since that time we have been unable to communicate with dispatch as well as between resources on the ground.

These problems are a safety concern during day to day operations; however we are now in our Prescribed Fire Burning season and soon will be in our fire season. Within the last week we had a fire on the Wilderness Ranger District and the Fire Management Officer had no radio communications with the IC’s and resources were engaged in the suppression action of the incident. This is a major safety concern that violates the ten standard fire orders and 18 situations that shout watch out.

As a result of the problems listed above the radio technicians have been working continuously on trying to renew the license for the Wave Radio system; however the underlying chronic problem has not been resolved. As an agency we preach safety and a big part of that is communications. Resources in the field expected to do their jobs as safely as possible need a reliable communication system in order to do that.","I had to communicate through Silver City Dispatch Center to relay information to the IC on the incident. This action was only temporary, as we get into the heat of fire season the safety of our firefighting resources on the ground are going to compromised.    A re-evaluation of the radio system on the forest needs to be made and a good solution needs to be found to correct the problem. Also as new systems are implemented there needs to be better training and instruction as to what has been changed so everyone knows how to operate the systems, that includes personnel in the field who will be using the system. .

Whatever solutions need to be implemented it may be necessary to bring in private contractors or more agency personnel to assist our radio techs in order to get the problems fixed and perhaps even bring some new perspectives and ideas to the situation.","04/01/2010 00:00"

During this process, he noticed that the assigned secondary air to ground frequency for Colorado Zones 1 and 3 was the same as the receive frequency for 3 USFS repeaters on the Routt National Forest. The Routt NF lies immediately east of the BLM lands in NW Colorado and is also covered by Zone 1. With our normal amount of fire activity in the summer, utilizing a secondary air to ground frequency is quite common and we occassionally use a third as well. Had this situation not been discovered, it could have lead to a significant safety issue at some point during the season.

The three USFS repeater frequencies were changed last year (Oct.5, 2009) and this problem was not discovered at that time, perhaps because most of our fire activity was over. This frequency has been an assigned National frequency for many years and I believe it is limited to use as an air to ground freq. This was no doubt an oversight by a number of people in several different agencies/organizations but could be a 'lessons learned' example in future planning, assignment and utilization efforts dealing with radio frequency management.","After this issue was identified, I contacted the CO State FMO, Fire Ops. Specialist, Radio Lead, and Aviation Manager as to the situation. Within about an hour, I received word that the air to ground frequency in question would probably be changed for this season and that the Rocky Mountain Area (USFS)Fire Safety and Radio Lead individuals would be notified. At this time, I don't know if other actions and/or corrections will be initiated before this fire season or not. By changing the air to ground freq. for this summer, the potential problem will be mitigated. In future years, the management and tracking of radio interagency radio frequencies may need to be enhanced.

As a back up plan, we discussed simply requesting an additional air to ground frequency from NICC when our fire activity required it and not using the currently assigned one.","03/24/2010 00:00"

The UTV was equipped with a slip on water tank and pump, and the fire was easily controlled and declared out. The UTV was loaded on a transport trailer and taken to a local gas station for refueling. During refueling, the UTV’s fuel cap was left off and subsequently lost. The UTV was then hauled to a predetermined trail head staging site so it could be used on a prescribed fire the next day (scheduled for 3/16/2010). When the firefighters were unhooking the UTV trailer at the site, they noticed they had lost the fueling cap. In an effort to inform the next day’s UTV users of the issue, they left a stick-it note on the UTV’s steering wheel stating there was no fuel cap. They then covered the fuel fill spout with fiber tape and left. Later that afternoon a firefighter from the prescribed fire crew arrived to pick up the UTV. The individual did a quick walk around the entire trailer making sure the UTV was secure on the trailer, and the trailer was ready for use. This employee did not see the stick-it note on the UTV’s steering wheel. The UTV and trailer were hooked to a vehicle and hauled several miles down the highway to the prescribed fire site. During this transport the stick-it note was lost. The following day the UTV was intended to be used for shuttling fuel. Due to the inaccessibility of one section of line, the UTV’s pump was used for black lining operations. Around 11:00 a.m., while using the UTV’s pump to suppress a hot area of line, the UTV’s passenger noticed fire coming out of the filler tube on the UTV’s fuel tank. He immediately notified the driver that the vehicle had caught fire. The vehicle was stopped and both firefighters worked to extinguish the fire coming out of the fuel tank by using the charged hose from the UTV’s pump kit. The fuel tank fire was quickly extinguished. The UTV sustained minimal damage in the filler tube and tank area, as water had been sprayed into the fuel tank. The UTV was towed to a trailer and taken in for repairs.","A contributing factor to this mishap was inadequate communications. Firefighters operate in a field where human error is inevitable. While losing the gas cap to the UTV was a small mistake, failing to properly relay the issue, and communicate it effectively, caused this problem. The 10 Standard Fire Orders remind us all to: 7. Maintain prompt communications with your forces, your supervisor and adjoining forces; and 8. Give clear instructions and insure they are understood.

During the incident’s AAR, it was discussed that all faulty equipment needs to be removed from service immediately until repairs can be made. The UTV should never have been left at the trail head for the next day’s use. If the UTV had to be staged for any reason, the keys should have been pulled and lock-out-tag-out procedures should have been followed, making it obvious the vehicle could not be used. The district duty officer should have been notified that the UTV was unusable, allowing for another UTV to be shuttled out to the trail head for RX use.

In this incident the fire was suppressed in the UTV’s tank by utilizing a fog spray from the hose reel. Each UTV should have a fully charged fire extinguisher mounted on it for such emergencies. All fire employees will follow these procedures in the future to minimize the chance of this kind of accident from happening again.","04/13/2010 00:00"

After a few days of trying to see what was causing the noise, it was positively determined that one of the scissor lifts being used by the contractor working on the new fire station next door to our dispatch office was the source of the noise. Whenever the contractor has to move that one lift around, the noise is produced over our entire radio system, essentially stopping our ability to communicate within anyone in the field.

Monterey RD (MRD) employees operate daily with the understanding that our repeater system coverage is inadequate. They had no way of knowing that the entire Forest system was down. They did what they have done in past incidents, formed a human repeater network and managed the incident.","MRD employees hearing the negative contact with LPCC immediately responded to E19 assuming the repeater system was not functioning correctly as has been a recurring issue on the district.

MRD employees formed a human repeater network to relay information from the incident to Tusi Station, who had made phone contact with LPCC.

The District Duty Officer (DIV1), hearing the traffic over the radio attempted to landline LPCC through multiple numbers but was unsuccessful. However, the computer network was working, so DIV1 used the “Sametime” chat to establish contact with a dispatcher at LPCC and provided real time incident logging as it was being relayed.

As EMS resources arrived on scene and updates were given by the E19 Captain it was being logged and passed on to LPCC via phone and Sametime.

After the incident, DIV1 reminded employees that in the event of another similar emergency when forest radio systems or repeaters do not work, we can utilize our cooperators frequencies as per our cooperative agreements in place.","03/01/2010 00:00"

At 1325 hours a firefighter recieved 2nd and 3rd degree burns to his right leg. The Burn Boss called Forest Dispatch and declared an emergency. 2 minutes after declaring the emergency the forest radio system experienced a failure. All to most communications with ECC were lost. Ground personnel were able to utilize a cooperating agencies frequency and establish communication.

This is not the first time we have experienced a communications failure. It has become very common on the forest. One repeater on the forest has been out of service for over a month.

Potential issues are accountability and safety for all employees and if crews were not familiar with adjoining agency frequencies the out come could have been alot more severe.","Reported incident and concerns to forest and it has been identified in the FLA which was conducted by the region.

Met with cooperating agency to confirm we can use their frequency for our emergencies.","02/23/2010 00:00"

The ignition specialist than tried our regular admin repeater and made contact. It was determined with radio checks on the ground and by helicopter operations that the console in the Fire Dispatch office and in the Smokey Helibase radio room is not transmitting on Fire Dispatch, and are not receiving transmissions from the ground personnel. The console in the Fire Dispatch office does not transmit to aircraft clearly and receives aircraft choppy. The console in the Smokey Helibase receives aircraft loud and clear and transmits to aircraft loud and clear.

The fire dispatch channel is used for the incident commanders, burn bosses and aircraft to communicate to each other and to dispatch.

If we need to respond to a wildfire, we are going to have to clear our admin channel for fire traffic only. Leaving us no back-up for regular admin use.","We have moved aircraft dispatching to the Smokey Helibase because there are FM base units available in the helibase. The ground units are using the admin repeater to communicate with dispatch.","01/12/2010 00:00"

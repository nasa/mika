too many people were confused on which list to remember or, for some, how to remember these issues.  It has been my experience that people need these things in order to cement the ideas.

Upon our initial informal crew briefing with the Canadian Division Y Supervisor we were informed that there was a lone young black bear drifting in which appeared emaciated. The Division Supervisor added that the bear was docile and very approachable insofar as one could feed it out of the hand. In fact, he continued, the bear would climb right into the back of his pickup for food. Our crew boss shared a laugh and we proceeded with our assignment without the crew boss saying a single word to the crew about the dangers of feeding bears.

I began to tell my squad that they are NOT under any circumstance to feed any wild animal during this assignment. The crew boss reported over the handheld radios later in the day that the bear had been sighted, but heeded no warnings or further directions. Many crewmembers approached the bear and took photos. While I was reminding crewmembers to return to work one crewmember returned to boast that he fed the bear. I admonished this individual but when the crew boss learned of it, he simply shrugged his shoulders saying grudgingly, I guess we shouldn't feed the bears, guys. As the crew split up each day during the assignment, the bear was spotted a few more times and I continually heard reports of people feeding the bear. The crew boss or division supervisor never addressed this issue to the entire crew at any point of the assignment.","Overhead direction, during morning briefings, explicitly directing all crew bosses and division supervisors to inform their crews about the rule of not feeding the bears and the dangers involved in doing so, and asking crew bosses to cite the time and date of such direction in their briefing records. This may have been done at the Biscuit Fire morning briefings, which I did not attend, but judging by the character of my crew boss at the time, I don't believe it would have weighed as an important consideration to him.    I would have insisted that the crew boss MEANINGFULLY inform the crew about not feeding the bears. I tried going to individuals telling them not to feed the bears to no avail because I was alone in my insistence and was regarded as a spoiler; especially after the crew's initial hearing of the Division Supervisor's adventures in nourishing our American bears.","12/16/2002 00:00"

Just after the new Type 1 team took over the fire, they began moving Type 2 handcrews around to different divisions. The team then had to move crews into divisions to replace the crews they had moved to other divisions. The movement of crews from divisions they were familiar with was a safety concern as crews were already familiar with locations of hazardous areas. A couple examples of moves that occurred follow: The team moved 2 handcrews from Hinman Fire to Bircher Fire and then moved 2 from Bircher Fire to Hinman Fire. Two other crews scheduled for demob at 1600 hours were moved from divisions nearest to camp (divisions crews had worked in and were familiar with) to a division they had not been in and was located a substantial distance from camp. By the time these 2 crews got to the new division, they had to come back to make the 1600 demob schedule.

The team also established a number of spike camps and had to shuttle in a large number of crews via helicopters at the same time. This was being done during red flag warnings for dry thunderstorms and strong gusty winds.","The team should have tried to spread changes out over a longer duration - 2 or 3 days - instead of trying to do it all in one day.

I am curious about the value of the qualifications of the international group of firefighters that we have so easily taken as our own. I have seen several incidents were they are either granted or given qualifications from their home unit that supposedly transfer over to the NWCG standards. These are:

1. pack testing

2. proper PPE

3. red card qualifications for line functions

4. training commensurate with NWCG that qualifies them in the aviation arena

5. basic ICS training

6. crew type-ing

I feel that we have not educated our personnel on the decisions made to qualify personnel that do not have to go through our system, yet end up having the same qualifications as we do.","A better understanding among our firefighters of how these personnel were qualified and who did the transfer of experience and training to get them to that level.    This was brought up with several overhead team personnel and I was told that NIFC and the NWCG had set a standard for what was acceptable and to leave it at that, it was not my problem. This is not an acceptable answer. In the case of a helicopter manager, local personnel have to go through a multitude of training and experience related task's to qualify for the job. How do we know if someone from the international group has gone through the basic aviation safety courses or the mandatory OAS training? We are setting ourselves up for failure with a large lawsuit hanging over our heads. We make our personnel go through vast amounts of training and experience related factors to qualify for jobs, yet we take it for granted that everyone else is qualified. Ask our firefighters for a red card to show what they are qualified for, then ask some of the international group for one.","09/18/2002 00:00"

Environmental factors included warm & dry weather with southwest winds, crown fire with flames in excess of 100ft (>15ft flame lengths in sage brush), multiple spot fires, flat to 5 degree slope, two track driveway with 3 ft sage on both sides.

While working on Division C, one Type 6 engine and one Type 4 engine were staged in a 'black' safety zone awaiting the passage of the fire front that was compromising the safety of firefighters in the division. The Structure Protection Group Supervisor approached the two engines from Division C to direct them into and around a structure for triage and protection. The position around the structure was being subjected to extreme fire behavior and, after conferring with crewmembers and Division C, it was determined that because of close proximity to a safety zone the directions would be attempted. It was also relayed to Group Supervisor that preparation had taken place on the structure in previous days. He stated that all the small diameter trees must be removed. Knowledge of fire behavior would tell you that removing this material while flame front approached would not offer any added benefit to the survivability of the structure.

I should mention that prior to this assignment I'd never worked with the other two crewmembers (from Las Vegas) or the helicopter manager (from Carson City area). While on the Whisky Creek fire in Colorado the manager and I had a breakdown in communication. This is a HUGE safety concern to me. The manager from Humboldt Toiyabe N.F. asked me to load the IC on the helicopter for the recon flight he'd requested. I was fine with that and asked where he should sit? He said he'd like to sit in the front. Right after he said that, I heard one of the other crew members say he needed to sit in the left rear for weight balancing purposes so that's what I planned for. The manager then went out to marshal because the helicopter was approaching. I waited a little ways back with the IC so that once the helicopter landed I could escort him to his seat and make sure he was buckled in. While the manager was marshalling she half turned and yelled 'right rear'. I yelled 'right rear'? to confirm the change. Then as I walked past her with the IC following I looked at her and said 'right rear'? to double check. I don't recall her exact reply but she was very rude and acted annoyed that I asked again. All I was trying to do was make sure I did it the way she wanted. After all, it was the third thing I'd heard in just a few minutes. About an hour later when we got back to the airport the manager asked for the flight manifest (I'd been doing all of them and had them in my pocket). I asked if she just wanted the top copy? Then I asked if she wanted the one just from that day (Aug. 28) or all of them? Again she was very rude in the tone of her voice and seemed annoyed at my questions. I just wanted to make sure I gave her exactly what she wanted because the day before she told me she needed the original copy of all the manifests. However, I offered them to her several times and she declined. To me it didn't matter how long they stayed in my pocket, I just wanted her to have them if and when she needed them and not forget about them. When we left the airport at the end of the day she asked how things were going because I'd been so quiet the whole day. As I started to share my concerns about communication between the two of us the manager immediately got defensive and made me feel like there was no room for my perspective on things. The things that I particularly remember her saying were 'yes, I get annoyed when I give one assignment and it turns into fifty questions' and 'you are very hard to communicate with' and 'you are trying to turn all this around on me and it's not me it's you'. Every time I tried to say something she said I wouldn't let her finish. It seemed to me that was her escape from listening to my side. I really wanted to be reasonable/approachable and honest with her and myself about things I could change for the better, or better yet what we could both do. However, I felt after trying to talk to her several times it was pointless because it was going to be her way or no way. She was right, I was wrong.

My greatest concern with this issue is safety! It's bad enough that this had to happen in the first place but then to have people unwilling to work things out so that the rest of the assignment could run smoothly is flat unacceptable! Communication seems to be one of the most common denominators in fire situations that have turned fatal and I don't want to end up dead or have a helicopter crash and someone else die just because someone doesn't want to be asked too many questions. Also, there is the potential for further problems in the future, which scares me, because the manager and I could end up working together again. How would that go if we still have unresolved issues from the past? Even if it's not me, how will someone else's safety be affected working with her?","I think there are two angles that this needs to be addressed from. The first is from a personel standpoint. The manager needs to review with her supervisors and personel officials how to treat people and develop some better leadership/people skills. Her attitude and language was rude, ignorant, and unprofessional. However, I'll be getting in touch with her supervisors to discuss that part of this.

The other, more serious thing that needs to happen is training on how this affects safety. Communication is at the very core of how we get things done on fires. If we can't talk, ask questions, and help each other learn then we don't belong on fires!

Perhaps if the manager and I could talk, with someone acting as the witness/mediator we could resolve this. Since we are at opposite ends of the state this would most practically be done by conference call.    I tried to talk to the manager and ask what I could do different so that these issues could be solved. Since talking to her didn't get me anywhere I just tried to be assertive for the rest of the assignment and help out wherever I could.","09/06/2002 00:00"

It is my understanding that the Buying Team altered the order with rationale something to the effect that agency (cache) provided safety glasses were cheaper and as effective as those requested. I have subsequently been informed that such a purchase from appropriated funds is subject to explaining to a judge, and that the purchase would again be denied.

It is well known among safety management professionals that significant human factors relating to complying with wearing any safety apparel include fit, effectiveness and ease of access/storage. With respect to safety eyewear, wildland fire fighters require:

* Fit - Safety eyewear to remain in place (on the face) in stooping, bending, brush-slapping, sometimes falling down conditions. Agency provided eyewear (typically laboratory glasses) are not adjustable and require other securing implements {some come with straps while others require addition-securing measures (corkies)}. They are also not well suited to hot, sweaty faces and typically fog up.

* Effectiveness - Agency provided safety eyewear confines moisture, causing the glasses to readily fog (making more of a hazard to wear that not!). Eye protection that protects from flying debris while allowing ventilation to evaporate sweat is needed, particularly for sawyers.

* Access/Storage - There is a large amount of safety apparel to wear or pack (standard PPE plus water, first aid, personal survival supplies, radios, batteries, etc). Bulky eyewear that is neither easily accessed nor stored is not routinely used. Often, the most critical element is assuring that firefighters will routinely use the safety apparel provided the ease in which the item can be accessed when needed and stored when not.

Agency provided safety eyewear is summarily inadequate in each of these basic compliance elements because they are ineffective in:

* Achieving or promoting employee compliance; and/or

* Ineffective (steep terrain and heat) in the wildland fire environment","Reconfigure national and local cache's to provide suitable safety eyewear.

Clarify/justify administrative actions (based on safety performance rationale) denying the purchase of suitable safety eyewear.    1) Re-ordered the eyewear (with justification submitted)

2) Contested the administrative decision to deny the order of suitable safety eyewear;

3) Involved IC in notification of agency administrators (USFS, IDL, BLM)

I was assigned to protect a structure as a firefighter with the Lefthand FPD. When we arrived at the structure the fuels were grass and Ponderosa Pine, a few of which were snags and were not marked. However my concern is that I was never told where our safety zone was nor did we have an escape route. I saw a torching/crown fire backing down a mtn about a quarter mile away. Smoke was very thick up the road about 50 yards or so away. I was hearing over the radio that the fire now at this time had two heads and the crew I was on was in the middle of these heads. I later found out that the ground fire was only about 40 yards away from our structure.

When I asked my Engine Boss where our safety zone and escape routes were I was told down the road about a half mile. I told him that I did not like that and I asked him to find a closer safety zone that I could see or to take me to the safety zone as I did not know were it was. He told me no, we are fine and that if I did not like it to sit in the truck and he would deal with me later. I continued to work and be a member of the crew. The other member of are engine crew followed the engine bosses lead. Lucky nothing bad happened. This was my first wildfire that I had ever been on. The leadership that the engine boss had I feel was not that of what an engine boss should have. He was always asking for the other crewmember’s advice on what to do.

There was more then one time we were in direct violation of the 10 Standard Fire Orders and the 18 Watchouts.","I regret to say that I did not report this to any higher command on the fire or in the department.

Disregarding the 6/12/2002 NWCG memo detailing work/rest guidelines.

Concern is that we as an agency and all the NWCG group send out direction and mandate adherence to policy and when the folks in the field try to follow direction the fire comes up with reasoning to cover up inappropriate management of crew shift lengths by incident management personnel. When management is not following direction and setting proper examples it is pretty hard to expect the folks in the field to have much respect for policy and direction.

In this instance the crew was given a justification statement from the region that is from their SOP's dated 5/26/2000. The box checked on the form states 'additional resources not arrived yet and excessive shifts were required to establish initial control of the incident'. Where does this statement cover the 'only exceptions to the following guidance will be an imminent threat to public and or firefighter safety' that is in the 6/12/2002 NWCG memo?","In this case if a reasonable assessment of the situation was done the shifts could have been staggered and some of the folks could have been put down for rest in plenty of time and still met the incident objectives.

There are times when the 'imminent threat' does exist and we need to bend the rules but these should be the exception rather than the rule.    The engine crew was well aware of the policy. They mentioned it to their strike team leader in plenty of time to prevent the problem. The strike team leader mentioned it to the Div but there was no resolution.

The work rest policies require that fire management do some thinking outside the box at times and definitely require additional planning when it comes to working crews and equipment during IA and extended attack.","08/22/2002 00:00"

The information above is only because it is the latest incident. This report is an equipment report about NFES # 0606, the DOT/OSHA approved 5-gallon fuel can that is now the national cache standard, supposedly safe for both storage and transport. The design must have been done by a committee who wanted to make them idiot-proof, and in so doing they became idiots themselves, because the cans are neither usable nor safe, even though they are designed to the highest specifications.

The cans are vented for storage with spring-loaded vent and pouring caps, and supposedly safe for transport because of a protective rim around the top (I think). The following lists the defects in the design:

1. It is impossible to pour fuel from these cans into a vehicle without spilling a lot of gas all over the side of the vehicle, the ground and yourself. The design of the pour spout and venting hole make this inevitable.

2. A person must be ambidextrous, Hercules, and double jointed to hold open the spring-loaded pouring spout and the venting lid, and at the same time lift and tip the can - an action required to get efficient flow out of the can. I have resorted to wiring the lids open while pouring - probably an unsafe act in itself.

3. The spring-loaded lids are not secure enough to prevent spilling in the event the can falls over. While loads should be secured, fireline driving conditions allow problems to occur.

4. I can't imagine that any helicopter manager would allow one of these cans on his ship! This causes a problem for helicopter transport of pump fuel, etc.","My suggestion is to remove these cans from service immediately, before someone gets hurt!

One solution would be to provide a lid for an old fashioned jerry can that is sensitive to pressure and 'pops off' like a propane tank pressure relief valve when the pressure reaches a certain level, and seals tight when it doesn't. Removing the lid and replacing it with a spout would make it pourable.

Another solution is to clearly define what constitutes 'storage' and 'transportation', so that ground support and supply could manage the situation with appropriate actions and containers. Now there are at least 3 regulatory agencies (DOT, OSHA, states) with conflicting rules and definitions, none of which apply very well to fire situations.    This issue is so tied up with government regulations and purchasing bureaucracy that it seems insurmountable. I have made caches aware of the problem (response: 'this can is a safer 'solution' to the old problem of single purpose cans that can either transport or store fuel, but not both') The cache managers recognize the problem, but seem paralyzed.

I have discussed this at Safety Officer seminars, Supply Unit leader and Logistics seminars, and Overhead team meetings. The response has been 'hmmm, yep it's a problem alright'. These forums seem to have little power to correct things that plague them.

I have discussed this with the Region 1 safety specialist, who has looked into the problem and determined that no agency has the right regulations to deal with this and related incident transportation and storage problems effectively.

The solution - get with ground support, supply and operations people to determine what the real problems and needs are, and design a solution that deals with both the regulatory problems and the equipment design.","08/26/2002 00:00"

Because of this interference a call of a helicopter returning to the airbase with a mechanical problem was not received. Reference SAFECOM 02-757 for documentation of the mechanical.

The radio interference causes the squelch to activate making reception of transmissions to the base unreadable. This problem was documented last year in SAFECOM 01-374 in reference to an in-flight emergency.","Follow-up actions from the 2001 SAFECOM included a thorough maintenance check of the complete radio system, a visit by the FCC, visits from several radio techs, testing of different radio models, and the purchase of a new radio.

The airbase services a helibase, single engine air tanker base and at the time of this occurrence was providing extended helibase services for incidents on the forest and three additional fixed wing aircraft.

The ICT# & OPS3, flying in 86F, were performing an aerial recon to check tactics, map fire spread, and check on public and firefighter safety. The transitioning Deputy IC flew within the fires perimeter and immediately questioning ' why is there a Bell 206 helicopter flying on his fire'.

The pilot of 86F responded to the Deputy IC that he was transporting the ICT3 and OPS3 on a recon flight.

The Deputy IC, riding in 5XP, replied, 'I am the IC of this Fire'.

The ICT3 had the pilot of 86F (Bell 206) relay to 5XP that 'the transition has not occurred'.

The Deputy IC then replied, that the previous night during a meeting at the District Office during the WFSA process that it was discussed.

The ICT3 rather than cause further confusion started to give the air space to 5XP, and the Deputy IC. Pilots then worked out a plan whereby both ships could continue their missions.

At this time no firm date or time for transition had been announced, only a tentative possible transition for the following day at 06:00 AM.

At the end of the flight the OPS3 informed Craig Dispatch of the incident, and received full support. This violation was also discussed during the transition meeting that afternoon between the IMT3 and FUMA & ICT2

Size and/or location were inadequate to address the minimum safety zone guidelines described as '4x maximum predicted flame length radius' for fuel conditions, terrain and observed fire behavior.

This was brought immediately to attention of local DIVS and other line overhead by this Safety Officer. It was also discussed at end of shift with the IMT Safety Officers.

In the event fire behavior required escape to any one of these 'safety zones', they would have been wholly inadequate for the already experienced fire behavior. At best, they would have likely been survivable (with the possible exception of one located between two heavily forested draws, mid-slope in steep terrain) as 'deployment' areas.","1) When considering constructing safety zones (particularly in mixed coniferous fuels...and certainly in steep terrain) JOINTLY involve OPS/SOF/FBAN in the assessment and decision.

The Dozer Boss had left the dozer to take care of some other items, and left an Engine Boss to supervise that part of the operation. This appears to be very similar to one of the problems experienced on 30-Mile Fire.

The contract dozer was abandoned on a road as the operator ran from the area of the flare up.

Operator also complained that he was expected to attend morning briefings (0630) but equipment time was not started until 1000. Shift ends at 2200. Appears to be an abuse of the work/rest regulations and costs contractors money for wages that the FS will not compensate for.","","07/23/2002 00:00"

There was no Leader to train me, however, I learned a lot by asking and had great input from logistics. While on the Unit, I had EMT's assisting me, and we demobed 6 days later. I was reassigned to Hayman BAER 7/21/2002, and there was a Med Unit Leader (since 1988-an EMT).  I was quite astonished over the 2-week period to hear of the medical advice that the EMT's were giving to people coming in for first aid. For example, eye irritation, appropriately were advised to try eye wash, HOWEVER, when I found out quite accidentally that it did not help, I suspected corneal abrasion which needed medical treatment at the clinic. I also had a young gal who had high blood pressure - the EMT's did not know what to do.  EMTs transporting a possible cervical (neck) injury down a bumpy mountain road in a 4 X 4, rather than airlift! Another was borderline high blood pressure with dizziness & irregular heart beat (History of family heart disease). One person on camp, had remarked that she had wished there was a nurse on the previous fire - she was experiencing burning on urination, frequency, and fever & was told to drink allot of juice. The girl was hospitalized the following day with a condition called pyelonephritis (kidney infection which is very serious).

For what this is worth, EMT's are great in the field, however, after my 2 experiences, I highly advise consideration to staff a RN in the Medical Unit as a Leader when possible.  RN's are able to advice & triage much better that EMT's and are more knowledgeable in disease management & recognition. I have 28 yrs experience as an RN, 23 of those years are emergency room. (Background also includes basic & advanced cardiac life support, CPR instructing). I was majorly concerned for the welfare of the workers and the medical advice that was given.

I was carrying large, full garbage bags of refuse from a spike camp to the field where I was assembling cargo nets for back haul by helicopter long-line.  As I lifted one to place it on the stretched out net, I heard something hit the ground.  It was a rat-tailed saw file, which had pierced the thin garbage bag.

Later in the day, when the 3 hotshot crews returned from their shift, I inquired if they'd thrown more than one away. They responded that they'd thrown several away over the last several days, and that no, they hadn't done anything more than just toss them into the garbage bags we'd had at the spike camp.

Concerns:

1. A rat-tailed saw file could fall out of a load while in the air causing injury or damage to people or equipment on the ground, or

2. A saw file could fall out of the load and strike the aircraft, also causing potentially lethal consequences.

The area surrounding the tree had been burned over and some open flame and smoke where coming from the base of the tree. The tree was approximately 150 feet from the fire line. The fire line was an unimproved dirt road. The tree was approximately 30 inches in diameter, heavy limbed and with the top broken out. The top was no longer present. The base of the tree had been fire scarred and exhibited the classic C-shaped scar extending over 10 feet up the tree bole. The tree also appeared to have what resembled a lighting scar running close to over 20 or more feet up the tree bole. The lighting scar had been healed over. The base of the tree also exhibited and open cat face that extended from the outside of the tree to the interior of the C-shaped scar. The open cat face was 2 feet in length and was connected to the lighting scar. The tree was located on a broad ridge top; the weather was clear, hot, and dry with a light wind.

The tree was flagged as a hazardous tree, but presented no threat to the fire line. Upon observing the cut it was determined that a near miss tragedy had occurred. The sawyer had placed his back-cut in a poor location on the tree. It appeared as the sawyer began to cut the tree and as the saw entered the cat face and lighting scar the tree barber chaired. The tree swung up along the line of the scar and twisted over at 20 feet. The resulting pressure and twist of the tree caused a heavy limb opposite the estimated site of where the sawyer was working to twist, break, and fall to the ground. The heavy limb was approximately 16 feet up the bole and about 8 inches in diameter at the base. The end result was a partially felled tree with a 20-foot stump and the top and heavy limbs resting on the ground but still suspended in the air connected and braced on the barber-chaired stump. A class-c falling instructor looks at the tree and said that falling the tree should never have been attempted.

Attempts where made to find out who the sawyer was or the crew that was involved with the incident. No factual information could be obtained. Someone did make a statement that the faller got bumped on the head, but this could not be verified and no medical treatments where noted.

On July 4, 2002 while patrolling the fire line on Division A, a felled ponderosa pine was observed. The area surrounding the tree had been burned over. The tree was approximately 160 feet from the fire line. The fire line was an unimproved dirt road. The tree was approximately 26 inches in diameter, heavy limbed and close to 80 feet tall. The base of the tree had been fire scarred and exhibited the classic C-shaped scare extending 15 feet up the bole. Further investigation revealed that an attempt to fell the tree had occurred. It appeared as the sawyer began his cut through the C-shaped scar the weight of the tree caused the tree to collapse, twist and fall down. The division supervisor had observed the sawyer and questioned his ability to fall the tree after the task was initiated. The sawyer informed the division supervisor he was a class C faller. The tree was one-quarter mile from the tree described previously. There is no indication this was the same faller in both circumstances.

The issue is whether fallers are sufficiently trained to recognize and handle the larger high hazard trees and snags that are partially burned, heavily scarred or hollow, etc. Are fallers trained to decide that a tree is just too dangerous to fall and not take the risk to try? These trees should be identified and marked to prevent other fire fighters from entering the danger zone.","Fallers should be trained to better identify and evaluate extremely high hazard trees and not attempt to fall trees that exhibit extreme danger of potentially causing harm from the falling operation.

Fallers should have more experience in identifying highly hazardous and dangerous trees.

Develop specialized training for fallers in all classes to handle extremely high hazard trees.

Faller experience records should be more closely monitored to ensure they have the qualifications to handle fire situations.

Consider use of explosives to sever extremely hazardous trees from the stump.

Faller certification standards should be evaluated on an interagency basis.

If available a faller may contact a safety officer or a supervisor before attempting to fall an extremely hazardous tree. A determination should be made whether falling the tree significantly contributes to or required for the overall suppression effort. If the tree is not felled does it contribute to creating an additional hazard and compromise the safety of other fire fighters or line security.    The issue was brought to the attention of the division supervisors and the operation section chief. Sawyers on crews (especially type 2) were restricted from falling trees unless they were an absolute necessity for personnel safety and line security. Fallers on the divisions where contacted and informed not to cut larger trees and briefed on characteristics of hazard trees. The incidents where covered in the shift briefings. No further incidents noted.","07/25/2002 00:00"

On-line firefighters unaware of significant weather changes that would have serious impact on their health and safety. Weather conditions on the Coal Seam Fire were being measured and monitored by the Incident Meteorologist (IMET). During a PIBAL measurement at 0740 he was alerted to increasing winds, beyond what was reported in the Incident Action Plan. He coordinated with the National Weather Service (NWS) in Grand Junction his findings and concerns. Their wind measurements at 10,000' were 50 mph (44 knots). They both felt PIBAL measured winds were the results of a passing cold front with associated thunderstorm cells to north of the fire. During a conference with other IMETS and NWS Office Fire Meteorologists, the Coal Seam IMET felt a sudden gust of wind. As a result of the conference call, and experienced winds, Coal Seam Fire IMET wrote a special broadcast for higher than predicted wind speeds and gusts. At 1123 hr, a SOF2 at the incident helibase measured a wind gust of 45 mph. The winds materialized on the fire and at helibase unannounced; the helibase shut down, crews were immediately shuttled from the fireline, while green and burned trees were reported being blown down. The Coal Seam IMET was informed by the incident FBAN that Grand Junction had issued a red flag warning for high winds and low humidity. The IMET was unaware of the red flag warning, and had also noted the Grand Junction Fire Meteorologist had been absent on the conference call. With a follow-up call to the Grand Junction NWS, the meteorologist did not realize he had a conference call to attend, did not have the phone number, nor was he aware he had to call the IMET regarding the Red Flag Warning.

There appears to be a lack of understanding regarding NWS protocols regarding issuing Red Flag Warnings when IMETs are within their jurisdiction. The need to attend a conference call was not passed along to a new meteorologist, which contributed to missing a statewide conversation regarding atmospheric conditions. This conversation would have provided a more consistent understanding that an atmospheric condition existed that was different than originally thought. The Red Flag Warning definitely had significant bearing on firefighters and pilots, and an assurance that all concerned were informed, was overlooked.","As recommended by the Coal Seam IMET:

1. Any NWS Fire Weather Forecaster must inquire at the onset of their shift if any IMETs are working in their jurisdiction.

2. If yes, who, where, how to contact, and are there conference calls to attend, when, and what number.

3. Any watches, warnings, or significant weather changes must be passed on to IMETs as soon as possible.

4. Particularly during a severe fire season as we are experiencing, it is paramount we extend our understanding of the importance of briefings to everyone to assure all important information, dates, times, and protocols are passed on and will be followed.  See situation review.

While conducting a burn out operation on this particular incident, the crew that I'm with had witnessed some things that could easily be corrected by going back to knowing the basics, like L.C.E.S. After our engine, as well as the two hand crews, the dozer, and the other two engines, were nearly burned over, some basic concerns presented themselves. First, the confidence level of the Division Sup., second was some of the burning experience of some of the crews involved, third why was there no look-out to keep an eye on the fast approaching flame front/ head of fire. When we were first assigned to the 'Walker Fire', there were Divisions A through F. We were assigned to division E for our first shift on the incident. Our engine arrived on the Div D and E break and our Div Sup., who was in command of Divisions D and E, told us that they could use us in a back-burn operation that was going to take place that day, so we said OK. The burn-out would consist of three engines, two type-2 hand crews, a water tender that would show up later and stage near the proposed safety zone, and a D8 dozer. The back-burn operation was going pretty good, even though the Div Sup did not place a lookout and we were going to be burning out in little canyons and draws, and could not see the main head of the fire from in those canyons and draws. However, we did receive a radio transmission from a spotter plane prior to when we had actually started our burn-out (which was about 10 or 15 minutes prior to the start of the burn-out). We did fairly well up until we reached the Div C and D break, which was around 9:30 to 10:00 AM and that is when the fire intensity started to pick up rapidly. It was about half-way through Div C when we started to pick up spot fires. About three quarters into Div C we started to pick up more spot fires a lot more frequently. It was about then we looked over the hill we were burning-out that we noticed the large black column that was growing larger and darker by the minute, it was the head of the main fire. We tried to ask our Div Sup about the fires location, and he did not know how far the head of the main fire was. By the time we started to pick up more and more spot fires our Div Sup said, 'The spot fires were from our back burn and not from the main fire,” which was just over the hill. When he finally realized that the spot fires were coming from the main fire and not from the burn-out operation, he finally pulled everyone off of the line and into the Safety Zone that the D8 was still constructing. When we retreated back to the Safety Zone the flame front was not too far behind us. When we were in the Safety Zone the Division Sup comes up and told us, 'I want you to go and put out that spot fire over there,' which was when the flame front was running at us in the Safety Zone. After the flame front passed us we proceeded to put out the spot fire. After the flame front went around the Safety Zone, it was slowed down by sparse fuels on top of the hill and was held by a dirt road. Had it not been for the knowledge and experience of some of the veteran fire fighters, this situation could have had grave consequences.","What this all comes down to is the basics.

Cargo loads coming to helispot unannounced and unneeded.

Personnel not clear of helispot. Just prior to the events that happened at H6, the first load of the “L” IHC was flown in to the wrong, and subsequently unimproved helispot. The pilot seemed confused that there were no helitack around and the “L” IHC members refused to disembark the aircraft. The ship then lifted off again and got them to H6 shortly after my arrival with the second group of “L” IHC members.

At 0954, the first two groups of ”L” IHC members were on the ground at H6 and clear of the landing pad. The crew gear was in a line approximately 50 feet from the landing pad. Helicopter 7XX announced he was inbound for dust abatement. He was visibly coming at H6.

Helitack did not clear area of people. Two “V” IHC members were sitting on netted cargo directly East of the landing pad, and a FOB was sitting directly West.

7XX flew over once West-East, then dropped four times (E-W, N-S, E-W, W-E). The FOB was directly hit with loads 1 and 4. “L” IHC gear was hit with loads 1, 2, and 3.

During these drops, the helitack crew were laughing about the drops and the gear and FOB getting hit.

After the drops, I approached “Z” and “S”, the helispot manager and trainee, and told them they needed to let us know when water drops were coming and to clear the helispot of personnel.

“Z” was defensive and stated 'A drop from that height won't kill anyone.'

I replied that I didn't care what height the drop was at, no one should be under them and that he (Z) needed to abort or orbit the ship until everyone was clear.

“Z” replied that we were welcome to call and abort or orbit the ship anytime we wanted as well.

After a little more discussion, we all agreed that we all wanted 'to walk off the hill safely'.

Shortly after this, a ship with slung cargo announced he was inbound to H6. “Z” asked me if we had slings following us in and I told him no. The ship dropped its cargo, which then had to be rehooked and taken to H4, its original destination. The two “V” IHC members were still sitting on the cargo nets while the new cargo was dropped off and rehooked. The ship was not told to orbit or abort which would have reduced the exposure of unnecessary long line operations.

“Z” then told me that for the last three days the air operations had been screwed up and that they had been getting water dropped on them a lot.

At this point we discovered that “L” IHC was missing a tool bundle and two saws.

“Z” asked three times what was missing and kept repeating that 'all three (shuttle) missions were with the same ship' which wasn't true, and it took a while to convince him what ship our gear was still on.

“Z” then said 'You'd think Region # would have its act together. . .we've been down in Arizona for a month before this. You'd think we had all the kinks out by now.'

Right before “L” IHC walked down the line to our operational area, three cargo nets were pulled off H6. As the ship lifted out we could see that there were two swivels attached to the hook with loads on each, then a lead line attached to the third. As this cargo was flying away, we observed what appeared to be backpacks falling out of one of the nets.","Tighter control of helispot by the manager.

The engine was on assignment for six weeks, three different crews had rotated thru before the problem was corrected. The midland radios we use require software and a programming cable. The software is downloaded onto a laptop and can program the midland radios. The cost for the software and the cable is less than $20.00. While I experienced no close calls or accidents, and I have not heard of any involving the mobile radios, I believe that the potential was present. Also, the local fire managers, as well as my AFMO and FMO, were very supportive and even tried to find a spare mobile for us to use.

July 6, 2002, I went on a 20-person IA crew assignment. We were assigned to Miles City BLM fire zone. Once again the local resources could not program our mobile radios. The miles city zone encompasses a large territory from the Rocky Mountain Front near Red Lodge to well into northern South Dakota and also from Canada to Wyoming. The zone is equipped with multiple repeaters but handheld radio coverage was spotty. Also once again, no near misses or accidents occurred. The crew was able to communicate via personal cell phones and was very effective. But, we had no local access on our mobile radios that were in the vehicles.","I believe that we need one of two things. Either we issue every zone, nation wide, all the software and cables needed to clone all the radios currently in use or we invest in field programmable mobile radios (not requiring computer assistance) and provide training on how to program them.

Smokejumpers/firefighters are cautioned to exercise extreme common sense in the vicinity of a burning dump.  This is an Alaska 'urban interface' problem.

The problem with this occurrence is that it leads to confusion regarding who is actually crew boss on the incident. I've seen this problem with incident commanders (IC) as well.

One of the points brought out in the Storm King tragedy was that firefighters were unclear who was in charge. On Storm King there was confusion regarding who was in charge, the local IC or the jumper IC. The 5109 policy fosters the use of three individuals as IC's and IC trainees. The fact that having only two IC's on Storm King contributed to compromised firefighter safety suggests that three would be an even greater safety concern.

Other agencies do not require the two additional assignments after an individual is fully qualified to take on a trainee. This has also created confusion on interagency-assisted fires.","Once an individual is signed off in a position, that individual should be qualified enough to have a trainee under him/her.

During initial attack phase of the Dalton fire the Air-to-Ground frequency was changed and/or reported incorrectly. This hampered/stalled communication between aerial resource and ground resource. During the initial attack phase of the Dalton fire, Air Attack requested the IC and ground resource to switch over to an Air-to-Ground frequency identified as 168.350 when working with aircraft. This was a change to the locally identified Air-to-Ground frequency of 169.150. This was never questioned by the local initial attack ground resources and they complied. This change was identified by the local helitack crew and pilot in-route to the incident but wasn't questioned and corrected until sometime later because of the congestion on the Forest frequency and the dynamics of the incident. Eventually the Forest Dispatch was made aware of the issue and able to correct the information with Air Attack, but because of timing the information was not able to get to the ground crews. Due to the fire behavior, incoming retardant and their location, the IC and crews needed to relocate for safety. The lead plane made several attempts to contact the ground without success. The Pilot made the Lead plane pilot aware of the possible issue and the fact that he had contact with the ground crews. The Lead plane then asked th pilot to relay the information and help facilitate information flow. The pilot then contacted the ground crews and relayed the information requesting them to clear the area. This was viewed as an incident with potential due to the escape route and safety of the ground personnel being compromised and not conveyable.","The most immediate correction action should be to thoroughly brief all new personnel, crewmembers and incoming resources on the radio plan and it's ALPHA identification issues.

Overhead","Prescribed/Fuels Treatment;","","Initial Attack;","Fire Behavior;Communications;","","The situational awareness of overhead, holding and lighting crews was poor. Fire behavior in light flashy fuels with increasing winds contributed to the slopovers. Communications were poor to non-existent. Respect for the skill level of the 130/190 studen","Weather included west winds that increased to over 10 mph as the burn progressed. I do not recall the specifics. Fire behavior was moderate for tall grass, exhibiting more severe fire behavior in cat tail patches. It was a relatively flat areas surrounded by a mowed line. The environment was not a significant factor, although winds were not considered enough in lighting patterns. An 18-acre prescribed burn was conducted in tall grass as a field portion of several courses. There was little coordination between lighting and holding crews. Lighting patterns were not changed with changing weather conditions that threatened mowed line. Engines were available, but not used for wet lining. With over 100 people on the incident, personnel accountability was poor. Slopovers occurred due to the fire bumping the mowed line with increasing winds. Inexperienced hand crews that were not red carded were chasing slopovers in tall grass. These considerations were discussed in preparing for the burn in the S-234 class, but were ignored the day of the burn. The potential for someone to get hurt was very high and disregarded by several instructors. Issues were brought to the lighting boss' attention and he found humor and little concern. As described above, an 18-acre prescribed burn was conducted as a field training exercise for several classes. Coordination, communication and personnel accountability were very poor and appeared non-existent at times. Increasing winds and improper use of available resources led to slopovers. This could have been prevented by using engines for wet line.

130/190 students were attempting to put handline on the mowed line in front of the lighters, however they were not keeping up due to difficult digging and inexperience. Following the first slopover several people suggested to the ignition boss to use the engines for wet line. Those suggestions were ignored and another slopover occurred. 130/190 corralled the slopovers, however the potential for a burn injury was great as there was smoky conditions and flashy fuels with wind driven fire. There was no need for this to occur. Extreme arrogance and humor at 130/190 students was uncalled for in a training exercise. What could have been a positive learning experience became an example of what not to do. When I have been involved in prescribed burns and burnout operations in my career, my fellow crewmembers are holding the line. I would never intentionally allow fire to bump the line or not use available resources to reduce the risk of spot fires and slopovers.","More qualified and experienced instructors from diverse agencies that value safety as the highest priority.

Field training is important, but over 100 people on an 18 acre grass fire is asking for injuries and lack of personnel accountability.","02/27/2002 00:00"

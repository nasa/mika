An example was dispatch attempting to give a weather briefing, units heard about three broken words during the entire transmission.  Radio tech stated the dispatcher lacked the proper harmonics and voice projection to allow the radio to broadcast appropriately.  <br/>This problem isn't something that has recently occurred because Law Enforcement is moving to another system because they fear their safety.  Using this system the past couple weeks has proved a challenge.  There are so many areas without cell service, that the radio is our primary means of contacting help in the event of a medical event.

This radio traffic bleed over can include: tone outs, dispatched resources, additional resource requests, patient vitals or unreadable static. Transmissions can last anywhere from 6 to 55 seconds depending on the transmission length and are unpredictable in occurrence and timing. <br/><br/>The concern of the Dispatch Center is that this radio traffic bleed over occupies the Hermano frequency which in turn occupies our Ute Mountain radio bank, not allowing local unit traffic to come through. This hinders our communication with the field, fire personnel and emergency traffic. Occasional static can also lead to complacency within the Dispatch Center as writing of traffic due to bleed over.","Multiple concerns were brought up from dispatch to the local BIA unit radio technician. It was first explained that the bleed over was a rare occurrence that allowed atmospheric conditions to line up properly and allow clear traffic transmission from Hopi to Durango. As radio traffic bleed over became more frequent, additional concern was brought forward in seeking a solution. After further review, the issue was identified as utilizing the incorrect RFA authorized frequency on their repeater bank. RFA authorized frequencies are mandated to individual groups, Ute Mountain BIA was utilizing frequency 165.6 and was issued RFA frequency 165.0. <br/><br/>What we learned: The issue was identified as an incorrect RFA frequency and is in the process of being corrected. This correction will minimize if not negate the radio traffic bleed over the Dispatch Center was experiencing over the Ute Mountain radio bank. This will also minimize safety concerns brought forward by the Dispatch Center. No matter how small or big the issue is, following the “If you see something, say something” philosophy we can help everyone communicate more effective and provide a better level of self-awareness within the ISO system.","05/15/2017 08:21"

Contact me at your earliest convenience so I can get around to everyone before the end of next week. [Tower crew] thinks he and his crew will be starting on the KRRD towers (repeaters) by Wednesday of next week. I will be available tomorrow (Friday), Saturday Oct 1st , and all of next week to get this done. My goal is to have it all done by the end of Tuesday. It will be easier for you to bring all of your equipment (minus the base stations) to me in Kernville, but I can travel too with my laptop and cables. Come see me! <br/><br/>10/5<br/>Tones 8 and 3 were completed yesterday for the northern Districts. Today’s plan is to switch out tones 4,5,7,and 10. Tomorrow (Thursday) tones 9 and 11 will be completed. What does this mean for you? If you are using channels 2 or 4 today and you are talking on tones 4,5,7 or 10 then you will continue to use the old channels 2 and 4 that have been put in your radio until you hear notification from Dispatch and/or me at which time you will switch to the new groups in your radio  to use the new channels 2 and 4. But remember, if you are on the new channels this afternoon and then need to use tones 9 or 11 you will have to change back to the old channels 2 and 4. Clear? Please call me if you need further clarification, thanks.<br/><br/>No one I talked to really understood how this was all going to work or the progression of the repeaters.<br/><br/>During an initial attack the previous day there was a lot of confusion between KCFD and USFS based on when we were to be using the 'new' frequencies.  KC had already reprogrammed and were under the impression we were already using them.  However, we were not.  The FS repeater is supposed to the command channel in an interagency response.  KCFD was not able to communicate on it. This caused a safety concern with ground resources and aircraft.<br/><br/>The following day on the Burlando fire the same thing happened, but even more frustrating is repeaters were being worked and switched over during the fire.  The forest now has some repeaters on the old frequencies and some on the knew.  Depending on the location of the fire this could cause several issues.  The radio tech tried to take one of the repeaters off line during the IA but was advised by fire personnel to stop.  Towards the end of the fire a call came out from dispatch advising that 2 more repeaters had just been activated with the new freqs.  That means if we are on an incident in the local area we may have to switch banks back and forth just to communicate between repeaters that have new and old frequencies. <br/><br/>We understand there was a reason that the frequencies needed to be updated, but in the middle of fire season when we are running calls is the worst time.  Not knowing all of the contributing factors from above I am unsure of what we could do better next time.  All I can speak to is the worry and frustration it caused for the resources on the ground.","Had a discussion with the cooperating agency and tied them in with the FMO who is in charge of the change over.  <br/><br/>Reminded everyone that we cannot currently rely on our radio system until the repeaters are all switched and confirmed.

After fueling at the local airport, our helitack module with four firefighters was dropped off at the dipsites for the helicopters to the north of a ranch with an unknown mission.  We saw a nearby vehicle and moved to it which turned out to be a Cal Fire corrections officer. We got some intel from the officer saying everyone was to the southeast doing structure protection; he said he would give us a ride over.  I made multiple attempts on multiple channels to raise any division to get a face-to-face brief and assignment.  I could not raise any division on tactical channels.  The incident command structure seemed very overwhelmed (more than usual) on this particular initial attack.  <br/>We accepted the ride over with corrections officer and met with Division Sierra, an unknown BC, and a patrol unit.  We did not receive an adequate briefing and helitack was immediately assigned to a burn operation as igniters which wanted to start fire at the toe of slope off of the road and take fire at base of hill off a road that followed the meadows edge with the burn out pulling uphill into the main fire. I had hesitation and a bad “gut feeling” about the burn operation at this time but did not voice my concerns to overhead, only to the crew. My concerns were there little to no holding resources available for the burn and a very ambiguous ending point of burnout.  There was also very little time between gearing up at the truck, getting fusees ready and moving into position to start the burn.  I decided to go along with the burn despite an uneasy feeling but I remained at the road as lookout due to my hesitation. I also sent the most experienced helitack as lead burner behind the patrol personnel to keep newer firefighters close to me in case something went wrong.  An engine arrived just before we started lighting as a holding resource.  We were lighting for approximately 3-4 minutes and lead igniter (patrol personnel) with 1 helitack behind him progressed very quickly and lit about 100 yards.  Before it could be recognized that there was too great of gap between the first and last lighter, the wind shifted and sent fire back at us.  The three of us closest to the road were able to retreat back down the road we came in on to the bridge and back to Owens River Road. The two igniters (1 helitack and 1 patrol) were cut off by the fire and escaped in the engine which took heavy flame on its right side.  As the three of us were moving back to the main road, I was trying to get a hold of the other helitack not knowing they escaped in an engine.  After a few radio calls I heard from him and had accountability for all my people.  <br/>We all understood that this was a near miss event and the crew seemed noticeably shaken up over it especially the 1 cut off firefighter.  This event led to the crew being less engaged the rest of the assignment and uneasy about our overall safety.","During the rest of the assignment, I became very mission driven to not let another near miss event take place by taking more operational control of our next structure protection assignment.  By doing this, I did not disengage the crew or resolve their uneasiness as much as I should have.  <br/>After the incident, the near miss was recognized as such during the AAR and has been the topic of much discussion to not only to identify the factors leading up to the unsafe situation, but to be used as an agency learning experience.<br/>We have also reached out to our neighboring district in which the fire occurred and informed them of our filing a SAFENET.

Air Attack had arrived on scene with in coming Helicopters and Tankers. Air Attack was doing the job he needed to be doing, trying to make sense and get things as clear as possible in the very first stages of this fire. Dispatch Assistant Center Manager kept calling Air Attack repeatedly on the radio. Once Air Attack had the minute to answer him he was told by the Assistant Center Manger about what was going on with the climbers and that he wanted him to go see if he could find these people so he would know where they are in regards to the fire.

I have a 2013 KME Model 326 engine.  The first 2 years of it's operation, the engine worked fine.  This summer however we have had nothing but problems with the PTO system.  The PTO does not engage every time it is turned on.  This has happened while in station, on assignment (Trailhead) and we have had multiple mechanics look at the issue attempting to 'fix' it.  So far, we have been told it is an electrical issue, a pto issue, a fuse issue and a combination of the 2 systems.  There is no apparent link between why the pump will or won't turn on. I have heard of other new Model 326 engines with similar or like problems.  One other engine was actually driven to Boise Mobile to be 'fixed', 'fixed', driven back and just yesterday, while on a fire, refused to throttle up.  This issue is something that the mechanics have apparently been 'talking about' for 2 years now but as of yet, cannot seem to come up with a fix.   I am not a mechanic but one common thread seems to be that these problems are all happening to the new model 326 engines with the single stage pump.  Our mechanic is completely stumped, our FMI seems unaffected by the multiple phone calls we have made to him and I don't see how this will get solved.  Unforturnately I believe that there will come a time when we are actually on a fire when the pto will refuse to engage and the result will either be a near miss or some sort of unimaginable tragedy.","The fix for today's incident was to turn the engine off, turn the battery switch off, let the engine sit for 10 minutes, reverse the process and the PTO did re-engage.  In previous incidents, we have done the above and needed to leave it turned off for hours and or drive it around for an hour or so which for some reason turned it back on.","09/09/2016 07:47"

The overhead on this particular fire were Branch Directors, Division Supervisors, Task Force Leaders, Field Observers, a Safety Officer, and Line Safety Trainee.<br/><br/>The Pioneer Fire was a Type I incident, with some of the Operations personnel being SMJ's and/or former SMJ's. During most of seven (7) days on this fire, these former SMJ's, SMJ's, and miscellaneous overhead failed to comply with basic PPE standards, mostly regarding hardhats, in timber while on the firelines, and failed to set a good leadership example for the Resources they supervised and/.<br/><br/>The main issues were former SMJ's, SMJ's, and miscellaneous non-SMJ's and/or former SMJ's overhead with ball caps and NO hardhats, on a fairly regular basis, while on the firelines. <br/><br/>The other Agency Crew leaders, wildland firefighters, Contractors, and Cooperators themselves were rarely a problem. A statement I heard often was, 'We should be safe because Safety is here.' One should be safe and follow safety protocols because it's the right thing to do and NOT because a Safety Officer is present.<br/><br/>These leadership and safety issues occurred everyday I was on the firelines. I politely and professionally mentioned to each of them numerous times on a daily basis about their leadership roles as supervisors, role models for younger firefighters, and to set a good example as leaders for their subordinates. Attitudes toward my compliance requests were mixed, with some being obstinate and repeatedly resisting, to others apologizing and readily and willingly accepting the corrections.<br/><br/>On one occasion, at a Drop Point in Division G, where the DIVS, a SOFR, a  FOBS and another overhead, were wearing ball caps in the timber. I asked them to please put their hardhats on due to the hazard trees in the area and because they were overhead needing to set a good example. The DIVS G informed that he felt that they were safe enough at the Drop Point, they wore them 'on the firelines,' and they were safe without them. <br/><br/>I asked them to please put their hardhats on. DIVS G told me that we were 'going to have a philosophical debate on the issue.' I explained that the matter was already settled and we were not 'going to have a philosophical debate on the issue.' He never did comply with my reasonable request.<br/><br/>That night, I recounted this incident to Branch Director (T) and told him this had gone beyond a safety issue and needed to be dealt with on an operational level. The following morning (September 7th), matters definitely turned around, when Acting Branch Director, at the morning briefing, told everyone present that their individual safety was a 'personal responsibility' and for everyone to do their part as professionals.  <br/><br/>These are clearly leadership and attitude issues. Some of these even fall into the Hazardous Attitudes realm enumerated on page xi, in the IRPG, namely 'Invulnerable - That can't happen to me' and 'Anti-authority - Disregard of the team effort' and 'don't tell me what to do.'<br/><br/>On leadership, the Red Book is very clear: 'The MOST ESSENTIAL element for success in the wildland fire service is GOOD LEADERSHIP. ...

The overhead on this particular fire were Incident Commander, Division Supervisors, Task Force Leaders, and Smoke Jumpers (SMJ's).<br/><br/>The Henry's Creek Fire was a Type II incident, with several of the Operations personnel being SMJ's and/or former SMJ's. During most of seven (7) days on this fire, these SMJ's and SMJ overhead failed to comply with basic PPE standards and failed to set a good leadership example for the Resources they supervised.<br/><br/>The main issues were SMJ's and/or former SMJ's overhead with ball caps and NO hardhats, fire shirt sleeves rolled up, fire shirts unbuttoned halfway or more, fire shirts thread-bare and torn, and carrying tools over their shoulders on a fairly regular basis, while on the firelines. <br/><br/>The other Agency Crew leaders, wildland firefighters, Contractors, and Cooperators themselves were rarely a problem. A statement I heard often was, 'We should be safe because Safety is here.' One should be safe and follow safety protocols because it's the right thing to do and NOT because a Safety Officer is present.<br/><br/>These leadership and safety issues occurred everyday I was on the firelines. I politely and professionally mentioned to each of them numerous times on a daily basis about their leadership roles as supervisors, role models for younger firefighters, and to set a good example as leaders for their subordinates. Attitudes toward my compliance requests were mixed, with some being obstinate and repeatedly resisting, to others apologizing and readily and willingly accepting the corrections.<br/><br/>Those that had their shirt sleeves rolled up often revealed bright yellow in their lower sleeves once rolled down, indicating these had been rolled up for several months to several years. In other words, this was a regular and accepted habit that had been allowed to persist by these employees themselves and employees' supervisors, both on their respective home units and on this and previous fires.<br/><br/>After our first Division breakout, one of the DIVS told me that he thought they should be allowed to wear their fire shirt sleeves rolled up a couple rolls. I told him that was not going to be allowed.<br/><br/>On the IAP every day, in Division M, was listed '6 Smokejumpers' with a leaders name. However, these '6 SMJ's' were seemingly allowed to walk the firelines without any real duties and/or responsibilities. <br/><br/>During one shift on Division M,a Hot Shot Superintendent was walking the fireline and came upon one of the aforementioned SMJ's, WITHOUT A FIRE SHIRT ON, SUNNING HIMSELF. He verbally chastised him for continually taunting his Crew, walking by them, with their sleeves up and carrying their tools over their shoulders.<br/><br/>The HS Superintendent complained to the Division M (also a former SMJ) about the safety issue with the shirtless SMJ on the firelines sunning himself.<br/>The other 5 SMJ's later 'sabotaged' the inside of the HS Supt. truck with numerous rolls of flagging. <br/><br/>During one shift late in the fire in Division A, W, D - I witnessed the Incident Commander driving his command vehicle miles in the black with two other passengers, ALL WEARING T-SHIRTS and NO fire shirts.<br/><br/>They drove past me and pulled over a mile or so down the road in a grove of tall aspen trees. As I pulled up, the IC, putting on his fire shirt, commented 'we knew you saw us drive by without fire shirts on and figured you would come after us.' I told him that they were now under a grove of trees without a hardhat on. The IC commented: 'It's in the back of my truck.'<br/><br/>I told him I would wait. He continued talking and laughing while putting his fire shirt on without getting his hardhat, commenting that it was in the back of his truck. I commented that it would appear I was showing favoritism if firefighters were to drive by and see him there, on the fireline, underneath trees without wearing a hardhat.<br/><br/>These are clearly leadership and attitude issues. Some of these even fall into the Hazardous Attitudes realm enumerated on page xi, in the IRPG, namely 'Invulnerable - That can't happen to me' and 'Anti-authority - Disregard of the team effort.'<br/><br/>On leadership, the Red Book is very clear: 'The MOST ESSENTIAL element for success in the wildland fire service is GOOD LEADERSHIP. ... The hallmarks of Forest Service leadership are ACTION, ATTITUDE, and ACCOUNTABILITY.' (EMPHASIS ADDED) These leadership hallmarks were NOT complied with in the instances listed above.<br/><br/>Concerning hardhats, the Red Book states: 'Head Protection - Personnel must be equipped with hardhats AND WEAR THEM AT ALL TIMES WHILE IN THE FIRE AREA.' (EMPHASIS ADDED) The SMJ's and/or former SMJ's Overhead were 'equipped with hardhats,' but wore ball caps on the firelines unless they were reminded to wear hardhats - sometimes several times each shift.<br/><br/>Regarding fire shirts, the Red Book states: 'REQUIRED PPE - National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1977 compliant LONG-SLEEVED flame resistant shirt.' (EMPHASIS ADDED)<br/><br/>The assumption here is that the 'required' standard is for the fire shirts to remain LONG-SLEEVED, without them being rolled up.<br/><br/>What is basically occurring is the Normalization of Deviance when we allow these Bad Decisions With Good Outcomes, especially when they are allowed and exhibited by supervisors and fireline overhead. <br/><br/>We hear a lot of talk these days about changing the 'Fire Culture' and working toward a safer wildland fire attitude with safer outcomes.

Flight operations on an active airport.<br/>	b.  TFR adjacent to General Aviation travel route.  (Canyon flyway)<br/>	c.  High tension power lines in canyons<br/>	d.  High winds over ridges<br/>	e.

Type 3 team managing fire.<br/>i.   Aircraft located in a large geographic area on the airport.<br/>	j.   mix, of all type of aircraft.<br/><br/>DAY 1:	On 8/19/216, I arrived at Thompson Falls, Montana for the Copper King fire incident, which had three aircraft assigned.  The flight operations were being conducted from the local airport out of an exclusive use Forest Service trailer using hand held radios.  The flight operations unit had been on the fire for two weeks and notable issues were observed: their power supply equipment was failing, hand held radios were inadequate to receive all needed traffic, and working conditions resulted in staff physically exhausted after a 15 hour work day.  During that day’s shift, the fire had increased significantly in activity.  The following day, the IC requested additional aircraft, which I ordered.<br/><br/>My evaluation for safe flight operations on this base indicated the need for a flight operations support trailer that had an elevated 360° view and room in the ABRO area to accommodate at least four individuals.  I was familiar with the DPL and knew that the first two units would not meet my needs.  I asked the local equipment COR how best to receive adequate equipment.  The advice was to order three and demob two.  Note: I could not find any references in the contract that would deny this procedure.  <br/><br/>I proceeded with this course of action and as the order was being filled, the Region canceled the order.  This cancellation perpetuated the condition of poor radio contact and an unsafe working environment (hot/dusty/noise).  One day of flight activity commenced with this risky set up.  Note: By this time we had nine aircraft with 36 plus takeoff and landings a day.<br/><br/>DAY 2:	Still no communication unit received.  With this development, I asked our team AOBD and the contracting representative and the regional Helicopter specialist how best to proceed.  The advice was to use an EERA.  I wrote up the specifications needed to obtain equipment and placed the order through our normal ordering system.<br/><br/>DAY 3:	I received a communication unit that fit my requirements.  One hour after receiving the unit, I was directed by the AOBD to demob it.  Apparently, ‘Contracting’ had ordered us to use the National Helicopter operations support trailer contract only,(DPL). <br/><br/>Realizing that our national contracting office was unable to provide safety equipment appropriate for our flight operation, we decided to keep the substandard unit and save the government $1,700 a day.  <br/><br/>We mitigated our unsafe flight operation by reviewing the following options:<br/><br/>a.	Terminating all flight operations.  This was rejected as unrealistic to meet the needs of the incident.<br/><br/>b.	Developing two helibases.  This was rejected as the radio issues would not be addressed and the fire did not have overhead to manage two bases.  Note: All orders for personal at this time were UTF.<br/>	<br/>c.	Ordering the next unit on the DPL.  It was determined to be more work to manage and was considered to have similar attributes as the unit on the base.<br/><br/>d.	Monitoring the local Unicom frequency and asking folks to let the box know of aircraft in the area.  We had the incoming type one team continue the setup of a linked radio system for aircraft.<br/><br/>The team ultimately received personnel to staff two helibases and two aircraft communication trailers were order per the Regional Helicopter Operations specialist, and the Regional Aviation Safety Manager who were visiting the fire and recommended that we place an order for two trailers.  We received one substandard unit and placed it on the base with four aircraft and a local dispatch office that helped cover our needs.  The second trailer was placed on the base that had six aircraft giving better coverage for flight operations.  However, none of these mitigations reduced the frustration felt or time spent trying to receive the best equipment for a complex operation.<br/><br/>We understand contract rules, but when it interferes with, or is written such that the field (user) is unable to complete their mission, an unsafe work condition has been created.<br/><br/>Testimony to unsafe work conditions include these statements:<br/><br/>1.	“On the second day of my assignment, we had nine aircraft located on a 4,800-foot airport and placed in front and behind the EU service trailer.  We were unable to observe all aircraft takeoff and landings.  We needed a unit that was high enough to look down the flight line, over aircraft and buildings that blocked our view.”<br/><br/>2.	“Because aircraft was taking off and landing behind the unit, as well as to each side, we needed a full view of the flight deck.  One unit was ordered and received, but was subsequently directed to Demob.” <br/><br/>3.	“Constant denial of orders and changes to our resource orders by management and contracting officials resulted in a period of four and one half days that were truly unsafe and potentially life-threatening.“<br/><br/>We are a make-do and can-do origination. When we have the ability and tools to complete a mission safely, but can’t due to miss-guided rules or poorly written contracts, then the system is truly broken and serious actions are required before a life is lost.","Filed Safe Net and would recommend terminating contract and getting a group of SME's together to assist the contracting officer in writing a new contract that doesn't reward low bid and offers best value to field users.","09/23/2016 07:33"

At briefing we learned that the weather was going to increase in temperature and the fire would get less humidity recover.  Previous to this briefing, Division L trainee informed the division resources that transports were going to be released off division L.  I don’t remember the exact briefing I believe it was on 8/12/16 but I’m not certain, but we were told this at a briefing previous to this one.  <br/>Division L, at this point in time, was a machine prepped fire line to contain the Rail fire on the West side.  The division was constructing line on the East side of road 2652.  This division had assigned over a dozen pieces of contract equipment, contract operators, and chase vehicles attached to the equipment, along with overhead, and other various resources.  Division K also had contract equipment along with other resources.  I had one machine with transport assigned to Division L and one machine with transport assigned to Division K.  I was assigned to Division L.  <br/>At this point in time, the area just had a storm system come through with decent humidity recovery and cooler temperatures.  After listening to the weather briefing, looking at the forecast in the IAP, and local weather, I became uncomfortable with the situation that the team was putting us into.  Here are my concerns.<br/>•	Weather was going to get a lot warmer with less humidity recover.<br/>•	Most of the resources, including me, were on a ridge top constructing line above the fire.  (Division L was above the fire for the most part)<br/>•	The fuel load below the ridge top between the operation and the fire was a concern.   This includes a very dense dead lodge pole timber forest that had been dead from one to several years with green ladder fuels from regenerating lodge pole and other various species. This describes the fuel load without going into great detail.<br/>•	No safety zones close only escape routes and “parking lots.” Safety zones I felt comfortable with were well over one half mile away.<br/>•	Most “parking lots” had whole tree decks in them (unburnt fuel)<br/>•	The possibility that transport would be released sending home our transport and transport/ chase vehicle operator.<br/>•	Recognizing that most of the division was complacent, focusing on the task at hand with the line building and minimal fire behavior, not much warning or communication about worst case scenarios with changing weather.<br/>I was concerned for the safety of my personnel and equipment.  I fell back to LCES in my training and decided that it is time to speak up and say something.  I kept my chase vehicle and transport operator close to me due the situation we were getting into and if we needed to get out of the division quickly, my chase vehicle was the way out.  However, I also had concern about my equipment if we had to leave it behind.  The so called “parking lots” were not sufficient enough in size to hold several pieces equipment alone.  Adding the unburnt fuel decked in the “parking lots” definitely made that a bad option.  Also, if we needed to use these “parking lots” as a safety zone or deployment site in a worst case scenario, that still would have been a bad situation.","After briefing on 8/13/16, I voiced my concern to my HEQB Trainee.  I had informed him that I wasn’t comfortable with the “parking lots” to leave our equipment in if this fire runs up the hill at our division.  I had also informed him we won’t have a chase vehicle operator if our transports are being sent home. I explained that the transport operator becomes our chase vehicle operator, and by releasing transports, there is no body in the chase vehicle to keep it close so we can escape in a timely manner.  I was dependent on my chase vehicle to escape if the fire made a run up the hill if we had no time.  Also I would lose my road guard to inform me to shut down if any traffic had to pass by me and my machine.  (The equipment on the fire line was working next to the road that traveled through the division which was the 2652 road.)  Me Heavy Equipment boss told me that he would check with his Task Force Leader or Division Supervisor to voice my concern.<br/>A few moments later, before we left spike camp, the Division L trainee and my Heavy Equipment Boss trainee came to me and I had informed him that I was not comfortable with leaving the machines up there in the “parking lots.”   I expressed my concerns of the size of “parking lots”, the weather, us being on the uphill side of this fire, and the fact the team is going to let the fire burn to our line.  His comment to me “You have insurance don’t ya.”  That comment caught me and my transport driver off guard and I didn’t know what to say so we just walked away.  My Heavy Equipment Boss knew I was upset and asked me if I was okay.  I told my Heavy Equipment Boss that I didn’t appreciate that comment, and that I know after briefing, Division Supervisors have a lot going on so I figured it was best to give him some time to think about everything he had going on.  <br/>After that I expressed my concerns to the Division L Safety Officer.  I explained having the transports released from the incident would not be a good decision from a safety stand point.  I also expressed my concerns about the “parking lots”, the weather, where our equipment is working in relation to the fire below us, and how the team is going to let the fire burn to the division.  He told us that escape routes are in place, he would take our concerns to his supervisor and get back in contact with us.<br/>Later that morning while we engage on the line, I kept my chase vehicle and transport operator close to me due the situation we were getting into and if we needed to get out of the division quickly, my chase vehicle was the way out. This is how I mitigated not having a close safety zone and using my escape route (LCES.)  Not to long after we engaged, Task Force Leader came and talked with us about our concerns.  I assume that our Heavy Equipment Boss talked to him also, but I do not know that for sure.  He assured us that our division had three lookouts watching the fire, the division had a lot of air support, escape routes were in place, and that we had time to get off the division if we had to.  I told him okay and that I really appreciated him come talking to us.  I didn’t say anything to him about the equipment safety because it was an afterthought after he had left us.  Awhile after that conversation, Division L trainee comes and talks to me and my transport operator.  So we broke for lunch and started the conversation.  He had the same message as the Task Force Leader saying the division had lookouts in place, good air support, and escape routes.  So I asked him how do we keep the equipment safe?  He told me that the parking lots were not going to increase in size and that option was out.  He told me, I can walk my machine to the other end of the division and see if there is any work there, or I go home.  I felt like I had been backed into a corner with no options.  I told him that I wanted to stay on the fire.  I also told Division L trainee I felt everyone was getting too comfortable on this division.  I had explained to him about a couple of burn overs I had been in due to under experienced overhead on other fires in previous years.  In the end I did stay engaged on the line.  I never heard about my transports being released.  I do know that other transports did get released, but mine didn’t.  <br/>Two days later on August 15, 2016 as I was working on the line, I saw that the smoke column was getting bigger and closer, fire activity was definitely picking up.  At that point a started monitoring Air to ground and command channels on my radio to get a better understanding of what the fire was doing.  I learned on the radio that the fire had jumped the line on Division K.  I didn’t get a clear understanding but I was under the impression that they wouldn’t catch the fire.  Later toward the end of day shift we completed the cutting and skidding operations on Division L.  Some contractors move equipment to DP 23 on Division L due to fire activity.  I believe that there were six pieces of equipment at DP 23, but I’m not certain on the exact number.  My masticator and its transport was on Division K were move to DP 21.  All contract personnel were released from the Division L and headed to spike camp or home after day shift.  My personnel had gone home because we were local.  <br/>Around 2230 I receive a call from another contractor that the team is moving the equipment from Division L drop DP 23 and Division K DP 21 to DP 22 on division L due to the fire activity.  The contractor told me that my resources on Division K were the most of threatened to the fire.   My equipment that needed moved was a processor parked at DP 23 Division L, a masticator and transport parked in DP 21 Division K.  The contractor wanted to know where my keys were for my transport.  So I told them that the keys were in the center console and that they had my permission to move my equipment.  I also informed the contractor that the agency (USFS) had my permission to move any of my equipment.  I do believe the contractor that got in phone contact with me helped move the equipment along with the agency.  So while the other contractor and I played “phone tag” due to poor cell service on the division, I retrieved my radio.  I used command to get in contact with someone on the line.  I got in contact with Division L Task Force.  I asked the Task Force Leader if my equipment was secure, he told me yes.  I asked what I can do to help.  He asked if I knew how to operate another contractor’s forwarder because they could not get it to move.  I told him that I would make a phone call and find out because I knew the contractor.  By the time I had gotten an answer on how to move the forwarder, Task Force informed me they got the forwarder to move.  At this time at night, I was a little shaken up by what was going on.  I know I was probably 45 minutes to an hour away from the equipment driving at night.  I trusted what Task Force had informed me, and I figured if I went up there, it would be too late if anything happened and I would be better off if I rested up so I was ready for the next day.<br/>On the next morning, August 16, 2016 we went through briefing at Sheep Creek Spike Camp, not much was said about the prior night’s events accept that they had to move equipment and to please leave keys in all the equipment from now on.  We were told to walk the equipment out, get them on our transports, and we would stage.  Some equipment traveled to H-91 I believe (the bald sister big safety zone) from DP 22 on Division L.   I went up the DP 22 on Division L and moved my equipment to H-120.  There were also 2 more pieces of equipment that went out this way.  We loaded our equipment and transported the 4 pieces at H-120 to the gravel pit on the 13 RD.<br/>I don’t know why much wasn’t said at briefing on August 16.  I believe that the agency was in “I told you so” situation from a contractor but no one wanted to admit it (that’s my opinion.)   I found it strange that not much was mentioned.  I did get the opportunity a few days later to see what had actually burned and see the slop over area’s on parts of Division L and Division K.  What I seen on Division K where my equipment was staged, is the evidence very active fire activity.  All the trees and vegetation was burnt (very good black.)  I never did get to see past DP 22 on Division L till later.  I do know at looking at the briefing maps, that the fire had gotten close.  I did eventually see where the fire slopped over Division L.  Where it sloped over, the fire activity was very intense.  The whole tree log decks and slash piles were burnt in most places where fire burnt to the 2652 road.  I am sure that I am missing some details on the after effect of this event.  One thing to take in consideration, contract equipment operators usually do not get to see the after effects of their work or fire events once we transport our equipment from their engagement areas to the next.  That is the case for me in this situation.  I know there was concern when the agency has to move that much equipment to a different location after shift.  Being an equipment operator, business owner, and a fire fighter with eighteen years of experience, it had taken a lot of time to move all that equipment.<br/>In closing, I feel that I did my part in voicing my concerns and communicating through chain of command.  When that didn’t seem to produce results at briefing, I talked with the Safety Officer.  Also, if we are told to leave our keys in our machines, I think it is time to reassess the current situation.  I do understand that leaving keys in agency vehicles is usually common on fires.  With the situation of having no road guards around the clock I was uncomfortable by leaving keys in my machine but I did anyways and I am glad I did.  Some knowledge I believe will help.  A brand new processor comparable to mine is approximately $600,000.00.  A used machine is about one half that value.  Human life is priceless!  I believe Agencies do not have enough training on equipment capabilities and production rates. I also believe that transports and transport operators can be an overlooked necessity to contractor’s team effort.  I believe the main factor that led to this situation is the breakdown of communications between a contractor and agency.  I hope that people have the opportunity to learn from my experience on the Rail Incident and maybe it will make a difference in the future.","09/15/2016 14:41"

Firefighter trainee was operating a Stihl MS440 chainsaw with a 28' bar using full skip, round filed chisel chain.  The trainee was wearing all required PPE and was operating the saw under the direct guidance and supervision of the module AFEO (a qualified FFT1 and FALB, with 12 seasons of experience, including one year of Hotshot time.)<br/><br/>Prior to initiating saw operations, the trainee was fully briefed on what tasks were going to be performed (in this case it was limbing and bucking a pair of previously felled ponderosa pines.)<br/><br/>The trainee began limbing  at around 1350, beginning about midway up the first tree (approx. 18' diameter), cutting limbs approx. 2-3' diameter.  The trees were located on an approximately 5% slope, with a south aspect. Weather was clear, sunny, 84 degrees, and 14% RH. <br/><br/>As the trainee worked his way up the trunk of the tree, the supervising faller/trainer constantly monitored and evaluated the trainee's performance, reminding the trainee to be aware of tip location, bar placement, kickback and fatigue awareness, and the importance of maintaining positive control of the saw at all times.<br/><br/>At the time of the incident the trainee was at a point where the two down trees overlapped one another. The trainee was cutting a 3' diameter limb located on the upper surface of the bottom tree, which was mostly concealed by the upper tree laying on top of the bottom tree.  A small (1-2') horizontal gap existed between the two logs, and at the suggestion of the supervising faller/trainer the trainee extended the bar through the gap and utilized the top portion of the bar(the powerhead was in the 'up' position) to cut the limb.  As the cut limb began to fall, the upper tree moved downward slightly and the trainee, concerned about potentially pinching the bar between the two trees, rapidly stepped back with his right foot, pivoted on his left leg, pulled the saw out of the work area and inadvertently brought the running saw into contact with his left thigh.  <br/><br/>Upon striking his thigh the trainee immediately set the chain brake, shut off the saw and notified the supervising faller/trainer that he had cut his chaps. The supervising faller/coach determined that the trainee had sustained no injury and that the chaps had received a penetrating cut approximately 1' in length, pulling out a number of Kevlar strands. The supervising faller/trainer immediately suspended saw operations and notified the module leader.","Once notified of the incident, and after verifying that there were no injuries, I had both the trainee and supervising faller/trainer write statements regarding what happened.

Additionally, I contacted the district duty officer via FM radio and asked him to come to the project site.

The overhead on this particular fire were Division Supervisors and Task Force Leaders.<br/><br/>Initially, the Strawberry Fire was a Type III incident, with the majority of the Operations personnel being SMJ's and/or former SMJ's. For the first two days of the Type 3 incident, I was the 'Team Safety Officer' when most of these SMJ overhead failed to comply with basic PPE standards and failed to set a good leadership example for the Resources they supervised.<br/><br/>The main issues were SMJ's and/or former SMJ's overhead with ball caps and NO hardhats, fire shirt sleeves rolled up, fire shirts unbuttoned halfway or more, fire shirts thread-bare and torn, and carrying tools over their shoulders on a fairly regular basis, while on the firelines. <br/><br/>The other Agency Crew leaders and wildland firefighters themselves were rarely a problem. Contractors stated that they 'followed the lead of the overhead' regarding wearing PPE. One should be safe and follow safety protocols because it's the right thing to do and NOT because a Safety Officer is present.<br/><br/>This occurred for several days even into the Type 2 IMT transition. I politely and professionally mentioned to each of them numerous times on a daily basis about their leadership roles as supervisors, role models for younger firefighters, and to set a good example as leaders for their subordinates. Attitudes toward my compliance requests were mixed, with some being obstinate and repeatedly resisting, to others apologizing and readily and willingly accepting the corrections.<br/><br/>Those with their shirt sleeves rolled up often revealed bright yellow in their lower sleeves once rolled down, indicating these had been rolled up for several months to several years. In other words, this was a regular and accepted habit that had been allowed to persist by these employees themselves and employees' supervisors, both on their respective home units and on this and previous fires.<br/><br/>These are clearly leadership and attitude issues. Some of these even fall into the Hazardous Attitudes realm enumerated on page xi, in the IRPG, namely 'Invulnerable - That can't happen to me' and 'Anti-authority - Disregard of the team effort.'<br/><br/>On leadership, the Red Book is very clear: 'The MOST ESSENTIAL element for success in the wildland fire service is GOOD LEADERSHIP. ... The hallmarks of Forest Service leadership are ACTION, ATTITUDE, and ACCOUNTABILITY.' (EMPHASIS ADDED) These leadership hallmarks were NOT complied with in the instances listed above.<br/><br/>Concerning hardhats, the Red Book states: 'Head Protection - Personnel must be equipped with hardhats AND WEAR THEM AT ALL TIMES WHILE IN THE FIRE AREA.' (EMPHASIS ADDED) The SMJ's and/or former SMJ's Overhead were 'equipped with hardhats,' but wore ball caps on the firelines unless they were reminded to wear hardhats - sometimes several times each shift.<br/><br/>Regarding fire shirts, the Red Book states: 'REQUIRED PPE - National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1977 compliant LONG-SLEEVED flame resistant shirt.' (EMPHASIS ADDED)<br/><br/>The assumption here is that the 'required' standard is for the fire shirts to remain LONG-SLEEVED, without them being rolled up.<br/><br/>What is basically occurring is the Normalization of Deviance when we allow these Bad Decisions With Good Outcomes, especially when they are allowed and exhibited by supervisors and fireline overhead. <br/><br/>We hear a lot of talk these days about changing the 'Fire Culture' and working toward a safer wildland fire attitude with safer outcomes. However, what I see occurring on the firelines by SMJ's and/or former SMJ's overhead exhibiting their double standards and unsafe attitudes on these three fires, I am less than hopeful. There is a very long way to go to achieve these necessary and significant goals with the attitude that prevailed on these fires.","Notified Incident Commander.<br/><br/>Continual reminders to SMJ's and/or former SMJ's overhead be good leaders setting good examples.<br/><br/>Continual reminders to SMJ's and/or former SMJ's overhead wear PPE properly and in good condition.<br/><br/>Thanking those leaders for doing their jobs as supervisors regarding PPE.<br/><br/>Thanking those that were in compliance for wearing their PPE and wearing it properly and in good condition.<br/><br/>Filing individual SAFENETS for each of the three fires.","10/03/2016 09:40"

The Bootlegger Fire is our 5th fire in this general area this year, and all of these fires have had iffy radio communication or none at all with dispatch.  The repeater coverage in the area is nearly non-existent.  Some transmissions were heard in dispatch, but the quality and readability were poor, and other transmissions were not heard at all.  The current repeater locations are just too far away to provide adequate communication.  This was especially evident later in the day.  As temps got hotter, we lost all ability to trip the repeaters.","For this fire, we established a human repeater.  We tried three different peaks in the area and none provided good radio communication with dispatch.  These three peaks were the tallest points within a 1/2 mile of the fire location.  I fully believe that the solution to this problem will be the installation of another BLM repeater in the southern portion of Carter County,  MT.  There are two county repeater sites with towers already in use in the area.  I visited with the Fire Chief from the area and we conducted some radio tests on the county repeaters and we were able to communicate at virtually all locations on and around the fire on the county repeaters.  The BLM could establish an MOU and install a repeater on either the Carter County South Repeater Site or the W Butte Repeater Site and we could eliminate this blackout spot in repeater coverage.  The new repeater could be standalone, or if the distance is too far to reach Dispatch the new repeater could be linked to the BLM tri-point repeater.  A new repeater in this area would also be extremely beneficial to fire management due to the large amount of critical sage grouse habitat in the area.","08/22/2016 08:01"

While on a severity assignment on the Battle Mountain District for the BLM. We had received a thorough briefing including maps, pockets cards and local frequencies. After being cloned up from a DPH from the local unit to our KNG we discovered that the clone would not override the already pre-programmed tone guards set by our radio shop on the Boise National Forest. In short, the pick list set up the Boise National Forest Radio User Group had been locked.<br/><br/>This could not be overridden by any variation including of re cloning or hand programming or even using a different set of radios. Also after further looking into this cloning problem we had discovered that out of the 16 tones pre-programmed into our KNG radios, we only had 13 of the local Tone Guards from the frequency list given to us by the local FOS. Meaning, we did not have all of the local tones that were required to be able to function on the district that was hosting us. <br/><br/>The local district did not have a radio tech available to us at the time to help with this. So with nowhere else to turn I called back to the home and the  local Radio Tech on the Boise National Forest. He told me that the tone guard “pick list” had been locked and the only way to get around it was to be reprogrammed by someone who had the KNG software. There was the slight possibility that someone with a KNG could also reprogram us, but that was not an option since no one on the Battle Mountain District BLM had an operational KNG. (All of this we already knew).<br/><br/>This was not only problematic on the NV-BMD-BLM, , while working in areas of the Northern Utah Inter-agency Fire Center.","The workaround we used was to cross reference the preexisting tone guards in the BOF KNG’s and wrote up a cheat sheet. Example. Battle Mountain tone 1 was 110.9 for the BOF radios that was tone 2. However Tone 3 for Battle Mountain was 123.6 and for the BOF radios that was tone 7. There was no work around for the 3 tone guards listed in the Battle Mountain frequency list that we did not pre-programmed in the BOF radios.<br/>  <br/>As luck would have it we were on a fire on a neighboring district and it took the better part of 30 plus minutes while in route to switch Zones in the KNG and then find the corresponding tone to talk to the Sierra Dispatch Center and then to pass that on to the rest of the crew.  This was not a seamless transition nor did it create and optimal working environment while in route to an incident. The Confusion from our end was we WERE cloned by BMD and we DID create a crosswalk to match up tones for the hosting district. But what we did not have the forethought to do was create a crosswalk for all the zones that were programmed into our radios that were used by the neighboring dispatch centers. Again, Nevada Interagency Dispatch Center and Sierra Front Interagency Dispatch Center. As Well as Northern Utah Interagency Fire Center and Color Country Interagency Fire Center. <br/><br/>Locking any part of any of these radios needs to be and should be remedied. Being able to program a radio on the fly during operational and non operational shifts is a critical part of our job in regards to fireline safety. I am not sure if this is on part of the Radio Shop or if this is direction from the Radio User Group on the Boise National Forest. However, to have this radio locked and unable to be cloned or hand programmed can be dangerous. <br/><br/>Lastly we were not the only unit/module with KNG’s from the Boise National Forest with this problem.","08/05/2016 12:46"

BLM resources were soon ordered to assist on mutual aid, Boise District BC-20 was the first to arrive on scene and immediately went into unified command with the Department BC.  At this point the only communication capability was on a 700mhz radio system that fire resources in Ada County operate on for structure fire, fortunately BC-20 was equipped with a dual band radio.  In unified command the BLM IC urged to have frequencies switched over to a city VHF Zone that has been pre-identified for wildland mutual aid fires.  The BLM IC was only successful in switching two divisions to the correct operating frequencies along with a patched VHF command.  Division Alpha and Division Zulu were switched to VHF after it was communicated that BLM resources would remain staged until frequencies were resolved so proper communication could take place.  Three other structure division were in place that were still operating within the 700MHZ system.  Fire behavior was erratic with multiple small storm front passages and 270 degrees of wind switches occurred over the fire area putting over 100 structures at risk.  Efficient coordination between structure divisions and divisions Alpha/Zulu was non existent initially due to frequency barriers.  Creating division breaks and coordination of suppression efforts and burning operations proved to be a significant hindrance to the overall objectives of the incident.","The BLM IC utilized his dual band radio to be a communication link between the Structure Divisions on 700MHZ and Divisions Alpha and Zulu facilitating coordination between the two.  Around 06:00 the fire had burned onto Idaho Department of Fish and Game land in which Boise BLM has fire protection, at that point the BLM IC then helped facilitate switching all resources on the incident over to VHF frequencies.

After the installation portion had been completed, they tried to log into the ROSS system on each of the computers.  Although it appeared that some computers did allow for a user log in, others would not connect at all.  At approximately 0800 this morning all of the users in the center were being logged out or timed out of the system. This situation continues at 1800 today.<br/> <br/>Currently the RMACC is supporting two T2 fires and several T3 fires across the region. At 1700 this afternoon, large air tankers and SEATs were ordered to support an emerging fire with high values at risk.  Over the past several days there have been mobilizations for teams, aircraft, crews, engines, etc. for all incident types. The concern here is making sure that orders are processed in a timely fashion and that incidents can receive their resource needs in a timely and efficient manner for the safety of responders, the public, and cost containment. Without ROSS dispatchers have had to revert to generations old paper based systems and fax machines. <br/> <br/>Since the initial release of ROSS, there has been a traditional software release of a newer version of ROSS in the early part of summer (usually in June).  Over the last several years there have been maintenance releases- which are still timed in mid-June. Each release has created some type of short term disruption in service; however, today's disruption which has continued through the entire day, has had significant impact on the abilities of dispatchers to support the initial attack and large fire resource needs at the local and geographic levels. Full ROSS usability has been compromised and some important functionality has been lost (for example the ability to print out resource orders and reports and the ability to fill team, crew and engine rosters).  Only occasionally have our users been able to login and access the system, only to be logged or timed out without cause.<br/> <br/>The RMCG is filing this SAFENET to document the risks, and issues presented during untimely failures of ROSS associated with planned maintenance and upgrades of the system during fire season. Although we are always informed that the upgrade has been thoroughly tested, this disruption has become an annual event each summer.  We wonder why the contracting oversight and the developers of the system couldn’t choose to wait until fire season before rolling out new changes to the system that could possibly impact the dispatch and resource mobilization system?","RMACC called into the ROSS help desk and made notification of the problems. The local decision was to fill critical resource with cardstock and to utilize aircraft request forms for aviation resource movement.","07/07/2016 09:09"

The two vehicles were rented in the beginning stage of our mobilization from a well known rental company.  Both vehicles were 2016 Dodge pickups, one was a 1500 model and the other 2500.  The 1500 was equipped with a dash mounted knob shifter while the 2500 had a steering column mounted stick style shifter.  Both vehicles had automatic transmissions.<br/><br/>The first Dodge 1500 completely died two separate times while driving on winding dirt roads in northeastern Wyoming.  The crew boss deemed it unsafe to drive, and promptly made arrangements with the rental company to deliver a replacement vehicle the following day.  Another 2016 Dodge 1500 was delivered, also with a knob style shifter.  One day after receiving the new vehicle, the exact same issue occurred.  The truck died while driving 50+ mph on a mountain highway (this time in South Dakota), and required the driver to immediately pull off.  Another lengthy phone call was made to the rental company and eventually another vehicle was delivered the next day.  <br/><br/>After demobilization and during return travel home, the original Dodge 2500 had a similar issue and lost all power while driving 70+ mph on a state highway.  Again, the driver was forced to immediately pull off and bring the vehicle to a stop.  <br/><br/>Thankfully no one was injured and there were no accidents.  The number one concern was the safety of the occupants of each vehicle when the trucks failed while driving at highway speeds.","Crew boss called the rental company and demanded new vehicles at the time of occurrence.  When the second 1500 failed, he told the company that we would no longer accept a Dodge truck.  Unfortunately, when the 3rd mechanical failure occurred the rental company claimed inability to exchange the affected vehicle with anything other than a mid-sized SUV that turned out to be insufficient for off road fire response.<br/><br/>Upon return from assignment and while checking in the vehicles, a full briefing of events was relayed to the rental company employee involved to include the significant safety concerns presented by the mechanical issues.  No charge was applied to agency credit cards used for rental and fire personnel were told that the problem would be addressed by the company immediately.  Involved staff intend to follow up with the rental company to confirm widespread distribution of the incident to other rental locations and with the manufacturer, as well as to determine whether or not a recall has or will be issued for the power loss problems experienced among these Dodge trucks.","07/18/2016 07:47"

The crew was doing this using a stihl MS460 with no modifications to buck up burning logs and felling burning Juniper trees.  The temperature was in the mid 90s and we had been running the chain saw consistently for the past two hours.  The saw had been running well for two consecutive shifts.  While falling a burning juniper tree the chainsaw died two consecutive times.  While attempting to restart the saw after it died the second time, the saw was making a sound similar to starting a saw on half choke but not as deep of a tone when the cord was pulled.  The sawyer not recognizing the unusual sound the saw was making thought the saw may be out of gas.  He brought the saw up to his leg, opened the quarter turn cap and fuel sprayed out of the tank in a 'fuel geyser'.  The fuel did not ignite which was fortunate because he was standing in close proximity to burning material. The saw was pointed partially away from him so the majority of the fuel sprayed away from him however some fuel got on his chaps, nomex shirt, and gloves.  The geyser shot out of the tank up to 18 inches and lasted for approximately a second and a half.  A 1/4 tank of fuel came out.  Upon looking into the tank after the geyser had stopped it was noticed that air bubbles were leaking back into the tank out of the fuel filter.","After the incident took place the crew immediately took the saw out of service for the day.  The crew boss notified all resources on the Cherry Creek Fire of the incident.  The crew took a break and discussed the incident at length amongst themselves and then with the IC.  After the shift the incident was discussed again with all resources on the fire during an AAR.  For the remainder of the fire the crew made it a point to give all of their other saws a break in between making hot cuts.  When not using the saw the crew made sure to stage them in shaded areas.  Any refueling that was done was done in the green away from any heat source and with a very exaggerated tilt away from the person opening the cap.  <br/><br/>Potential problems with the saw could be the air coming back into the tank via the fuel line, and the tank vent not releasing extra pressure.  The tank vent will be replaced and the saw run again in a controlled environment prior to the saw being placed back in service.  <br/><br/>The crew has now discussed at length the unusual sound that the saw was making while the sawyer was attempting to restart the saw and made it a point that if a saw is making an unusual sound then something is probably wrong.  Also if a saw has been running well and dies and still has fuel in it, it should start on the first pull, if it doesn't something is probably wrong.  If any of this takes place we recommend placing the saw in the shade and allowing it to thoroughly cool down prior to opening the cap.","07/05/2016 08:06"

The 'temporary fix' for this was the rental of two shipping containers for equipment storage.  The containers are rented thus we cannot make any alterations to the structure of the containers.  During the spring of 2016, district personnel constructed tool racks for safer storage of hand tools(previous to this tools were leaned against the wall and were a tripping hazard due to poor lighting within the containers).  The racks were held in place by nails, screws, and chains connected to fastening points that are permanently attached inside of the containers.  When the weather heats up during the summer months the inside of the containers become very hot.  We determined that this directly resulted in the wood to warp and twist, pulling out the nails and screws and thus causing the racks to collapse (note in the pictures provided that the top of the rack is still suspended by chains).  The collapse occurred on Saturday, June 25 2016 while the crew was on days off and was discovered the next morning.<br/><br/>If any personnel had been in the container when the collapse occurred it would have resulted in serious injuries.","Immediate actions taken were to remove the tool rack from service and continue to store the hand tools on the deck of the container. This is still only a temporary solution as now the tripping hazard is present again. We are determining a plan 'C' at this time (unknown what that will be). But, until we can get cache facilities, we continually will be challenged with proper and adequate storage of our equipment.","07/05/2016 08:06"

I had a direct line of sight to McFadden Lookout tower at the time I tried to make contact.<br/><br/>I continued down highway 288 towards Workman Creek and tied in with IC trainee a half mile down the road.  At that time, Juniper lookout called the IC trainee to inform him that they were trying to reach me on the radio but could not make contact.  Juniper IC trainee informed the lookout that I was sitting next to him and he could dis-regard the relay.  At that time, my KNG-P150S did not pick up any radio transmission, however, the IC trainee radio, Bendix King DPH handheld radio, had no issues with radio reception.<br/><br/>The IC trainee and I relocated to Honey Creek Divide camping area.  We were both scanning all radio channels for the forest.  Multiple times, the IC trainee received radio traffic on the forest net repeater with his BK DPH radio and my BK KNG-P150S received nothing.  I walked around with my KNG-P150S held in high in the air trying to get reception and only then could I get off and on reception.  Poor radio reception was experienced on forest net and TAC channels.

Due to this the crew did not have the updated air to ground and was unable to hit our repeaters as there  were repeater tone issues and comms. guide issues that had been resolved from the 2015 season.

I was near some of the Miles City crewmembers and could hear air attack’s conversation with the IC on their radios but I was not hearing the traffic on my radio.  I asked which channel the traffic was on and they replied A/G 66.  In my radio (and in all the Billings crew’s radios) for the Miles City and Fort Howes Groups we had A/G 10 and A/G 52, although A/G 66 and A/G 13 are listed in our 2016 Montana/Dakotas Frequency Guide.  After confirming with the IC that A/G 66 and A/G 13 were the correct air-to-ground frequencies the Billings crew hand programmed those into our handheld radios.  The fact that I was near the other crew when air attack was over our fire allowed us to mitigate the potential lack of communication with aviation resources due to incorrect radio frequencies.","When we confirmed the correct air-to-ground frequencies were not in our radios we programmed them in manually on the fire.  We also checked the rest of the frequencies in the Miles City and Fort Howes Groups and found other inconsistencies, such as the order of the frequencies did not match between the radios and the Guide, the same repeater had different Tx frequencies between the two Groups, and our radios had repeaters that were not listed in the Guide.  When we returned to our home unit we performed a detailed review of the frequencies in our radios and compared them against the Montana/Dakotas Frequency Guide.

I made an attempt to trigger the Tri Point tower on my handheld radio and had no luck engaging the tower at all. I moved to my truck and attempted on the mobile radio and had the same issue not being able to engage the tower at all. I tried towers Forest Service Tri Point, Home Creek, Diamond Butte, Forest Service Tower Hill and BLM Tri Point all with no ability to engage.

This lasted approximately two and a half hours and then I was able to access all the towers via both mobile and handheld.

At the time of the incident ICT3, OSC, DIVS A, DIVS C and DIVS C(t) were discussing how to tactically engage resources for the next day’s operation.  After then plan was discussed, the group started to leave Helibase and head towards camp where all fire personnel were located.  While in route to the camp an individual from one of the crew called for DIVS C (t).  DIVS (t) was driving an open cab UTV and was unable to hear the call from the individual.  Therefore, DIVS C picked up the call.  Once he picked up the call the individual relayed that there may be a medical emergency evolving.  DIVS C inquired as to whether ALS treatment and evacuation was needed and the individual was unsure.  Moments later, the patient began having a seizure and the individual on the radio relayed that ALS treatment was needed and Life Flight evacuation was also needed.  Simultaneously while this was happened individuals from 2 other crews began to size-up the situation.  Both crews had very experienced structural fire fighters who were EMT’s and Paramedic qualified.  One crew took command of the incident and relayed to DIVS C who they were, and yes, emergency evacuation of the patent was needed.   The local county resources on scene had face to face communication with the medic in charge and immediately started to order Life Flight through their local dispatch center.  While this was happening the overhead from the incident continued to travel towards base camp.  As soon as it was clear that Life Flight was needed and there was a serious medical emergency developing OSC instructed DIVS C to oversee patient care (by supporting the medic in charge) and instructed the local county resources to contact Life Flight through their county dispatch.  As soon as OSC contacted the county resources he was told by them that they had already done so.  After this, the overhead folks on the fire completely deferred to the expertise of the medic in charge and the local county resources and developed a plan B (county resources were dispatching a ground ambulance) and a plan C (Meet the county ambulance half way with the patient in one of the crew vehicles) Both of these contingency plans were developed based on the input from the county resources and the medic in charge.  While this was occurring, ICT3 was utilizing the Satellite Phone to communicate with Casper Interagency Dispatch Center.  Overall, this incident with in an incident went as smooth as it could, with Life Flight arriving and taking the patient to the hospital where it was found that he was extremely low on sodium.","Prior to this incident occurring, it is worth noting that this is a known area where communications are consistently bad.  It is commonly referred to as a ‘black hole’.   While utilizing both the conventional repeater and digital radio’s (WYOlink) communication back to Casper Interagency Dispatch Center was sporadic and spotty at best.  There are Miles City repeaters near the area and it was determined that these repeaters did not provide coverage to the south end of the fire where Spike Camp and Helibase were located.  Campbell County even had trouble reaching their dispatch center.  There have been multiple Type 3 incidents within this area in the last 10 years and this ‘black hole’ has always been a problem.  To help mitigate this, a portable repeater was ordered and set up prior to the medical incident.  However, this portable repeater was unable to reach Casper Dispatch Center.  Due to the fire history of the area, there will be another Type 3 incident in the same area and hopefully this will highlight this communications ‘black hole.’      <br/>	After the medical incident an AAR was facilitated to discuss how everything went.  It was determined that everything went very well with the heavy staffing of experienced EMT’s and paramedics.  The ability of the Short Fire command to allow these folks in conjunction with Campbell County’s experience in ordering Life Flight made this an example of how a medical incident should go.  However, the question was raised what would we have done without Campbell Counties ability and experience to order Life Flight?  This is once again where the ‘black hole’ is highlighted.  While utilizing county dispatch to order Life Flight worked very well, what would have happened if they were not there?  Would we have been able to reach Casper Dispatch with the current system?","07/07/2016 09:09"

Within a fraction of a second I was pinned to the drivers seat with no idea what was going on.  I glanced over at the passenger fully prepared to see a decapitation and blood spurting every where. Pleasantly that had not occurred, nor was I impaled at the kidney/liver. Confusion reigned.     <br/><br/>A spring pole had entered the top, forward, right portion of the roll cage; deflected against the rear window(behind the passengers head - bending the metal head rest) continued in an arc down along the seat and to the left eventually ending up pressing across my lap (drivers side) with the tip protruding about three inches out of the door frame.  As the pole traveled through the cab it grabbed my jacket at the right side pocket and carried my coat and under layers out the door with the tip (rip stop jacket and vest were penetrated).  My clothes were gathered in such a way that had I not been seat belted I possibly would have been carried outside the cab.  My coat covered/hid the spring pole, I couldn't tell how or why I couldn't move. I did not realize I was pinned. One of the most bizarre situations I have encountered, freakish.

The head rest was readily bent back into place and the door frame gasket reattached with minor abrasions.  No injuries were sustained.

The repeaters, being only a small distance away from the fire location (tower was visible from burned area), provided very good communication for local resources on the fire, but could not be heard at any distances.  Initially, Engine 2604 could not communicate with dispatch via BLM Tripoint following the tone out.  Then, when 2603 arrived on-scene and took control of the incident I could not relay any size-up information to dispatch via BLM or USFS Tripoint.  We were forced to use the DNRC Conger Hill repeater for the initial phase of the fire to communicate with dispatch.  The was not a great solution either, being that the Conger Hill repeater is a long distance away and it caused several issues while trying to transmit and receive on a handheld radio.  The problem that I was experiencing on my end of BLM Tripoint was that dispatch was very faint and mostly inaudible on all of their transmissions.  There was a short period (an hour or two) each morning that BLM Tripoint worked without issue (approx. 0700-0900).  Dispatch was never able to copy any of my transmissions on USFS Tripoint, despite multiple attempts over the 3 day fire.  The final day of the fire, I was able to communicate with dispatch by transmitting from the fire on BLM Tripoint and having dispatch transmit on USFS Tripoint (which I received loud and clear).  In order to safely perform the duties of wildland suppression, we need to be able to communicate effectively with our dispatch unit.  Had this fire been any further east on the zone, the Conger Hill repeater would not have been a viable option and there would have been absolutely no ability to communicate with dispatch.  This poses threats on multiple levels, as it would prohibit the ability to provide size ups, resource and supply needs, and most critically med-evac information should the need arise.","I was fortunately able to utilize the other repeater mentioned above, but it required some special considerations, such as using a mobile vs handheld and finding good locations to transmit.  I performed radio checks multiple times a day on the three repeaters I had available to be sure that I could contact dispatch in some fashion to relay critical information.  These actions that I took were merely a temporary mitigation to a problem that needs a long-term solution.","06/14/2016 07:34"

The military was using their helicopters and their communications network.  Which, required me to use a separate radio.  This is not at all useful or safe.  I was our front of the crew.  The concern is that I was given at three separate times three radios to try and establish communication with the helicopters.  <br/><br/>So for the first few hours I had to have crewmembers relay three radios out in front to me.  This in and of its self is and an issue but the bigger issue is that once I was able to communicate with the helicopters, I was the only one from the crew that had any idea what was going on.  The work around was to have the helicopter move out front far away from us. But as we got closer to the helicopter's working area the issues became more prevalent.  It was very difficult to establish positive comms do to the way in which the military helicopters are use to operating. which made it more difficult to begin precise water drops around the are the crew was working.  Overall the communication system and work style needs to be addressed.  On, the second day we began to experience the same miscommunication issues.  But, these issues were even more significant as on two separate instances water was dropped from the Type 1 Chinook on top of crew members from two different crews.  <br/><br/>The first problem is not in the pilots lack of care, it is in the 'system'.

The second day of the incident we got the helicopters that could communicate with firefighters on the ground using King radios.  Then we began to work through common understandings of what and how to work together. IT was a quick but learning situation. That can be addressed with some real hands on training with some hands on training in the  wild land fire world, by non-military folks.  The third issue is the manor in which the helicopters operated.  On 5/16/16  BlackHawk had a significant bucket strike on the ground.

A check engine light came on which overrode the operators ability to complete an OCR(operator controlled regeneration). The engine then began to experience a marked loss of power.  Due to critical holding needs of the burn operation, 5670 was kept in service until completion of the burn. The engine had very little power, even in 4 wheel drive. It made navigating very difficult throughout the night due to steep terrain and recently constructed dozer line.  Upon completion of the firing operation E-5670 was driven off the line and placed out of service. There are more details in regards to what caused this problem in a deficiency report submitted on 5/16/15","Extra time and coordination with firing was taken to ensure that E-5670 had good ingress and egress.

The PNW IHC crews have several stories of crew carrier breakdowns that could have resulted in undesirable outcomes.  All of the examples provided are first-hand accounts, as I have spoken to the Superintendents involved in each breakdown and they have reviewed the content of this safenet prior to submittal.   <br/>One of our crews had their broken crew carrier protruding onto an interstate lane between Tucson and Phoenix.  Many of our crews have experienced severe or complete loss of power on congested interstate highways several times.  One of our crews had their carrier breakdown on a proposed burnout that halted the entire operation for 2 shifts because it blocked a forest road that would have been within the proposed burn area.  One of our crews had trouble getting their carrier to start when fire behavior dictated it was time to leave the fireline.  Another crew was leaving an active fire at the end of shift and broke down on a remote, narrow, steep road (luckily the fire was moving away from them).  <br/>These are the most severe examples of close calls due to the unreliability of these crew carriers.  Keep in mind that when a crew carrier breaks down 8-10 people are exposed. <br/>Please read the attached briefing paper on the unreliability of the 2011 and 2012 international crew carriers operating in Region 6.  The attached spreadsheet details most of the mechanical failures and the situations where they occurred through the fall of 2018. Already this spring we have had 4 of the crew carriers in the shop for various mechanical failures. One additional crew carrier has been out of service since last fall due to a major mechanical failure.","All Superintendents involved have notified local fleet and fire management of the issue.

Radio frequency to contact dispatch was established as BIA Pajarito. Fire was extremely active, with fire running in grass and brush. Size was estimated at 50-75 acres. Equipment, crews and air support was ordered by 0730. During the start of the incident, Mescalero BIA radio frequencies were extremely hard to copy due to broken transmissions and interference. The majority of resource transmission calling in to report they were on scene were broken and unreadable leaving communication with dispatch a safety issue. <br/><br/>Around, 0930 dispatch was unable to make contact with the Incident Commander or any other resources assigned to the incident. Dispatch attempted to contact the incident using BIA Pajarito, Cienegita, and Wofford. Dispatch continued to try and reach any resources on the incident for the next 30 minutes. At 1000, dispatch contacted a crew on the incident via the Forest Service Buck frequency and asked them to contact the IC on the incident TAC channel and relay to the IC to contact dispatch. Whitetail IC then attempted to contacted dispatch on BIA frequencies. Dispatch tried to relay that an Air Tanker was en route and that the power lines had been de-energized by the power company, but dispatch found it hard to ensure message was relayed as IC's transmission was broken and unreadable. <br/><br/>At 1030, IC was unable to transmit on BIA frequencies to Dispatch and was forced to switch over to the Forest Service Buck frequency in order to inform dispatch that the Air Tanker was on a hold and to cancel load and return. <br/><br/>The inability for dispatch to communicate with resources on Wildland Fire incidents using BIA frequencies has been a reoccurring issue. The last incident on Mescalero BIA, resources were required to utilize Forest Service frequencies during the incident due to BIA radio frequencies not functioning.

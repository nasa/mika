We were headed out to work on some fire re-hab projects. We were about 15 miles south of the Arizona/Utah state line on BLM road 1069 at about 2PM. As we were going uphill, around a blind turn to the right, on the side of the road to our right, we saw a motorcycle headed straight toward us. With very little time to react I swerved to the left to avoid a head on collision. At the same time the driver of the motorcycle locked up his brakes and skidded until he impacted the front right side of the pick-up. With only moments between us seeing each other and impact I acted on pure gut reaction. He was so far to the right side of the road I knew that the only chance was to swerve to the left. The driver of the motorcycle sustained multiple breaks in his upper right arm, a couple of broken ribs, a lacerated kidney, broken lower leg, ankle and foot. He had a helmet on but had a mild concussion. We contacted our logistics center within moments of the accident. They called 911 and had the paramedics en route within a minute. The passenger and I rendered first aid until the ambulance arrived. This accident happened on a dry dirt road in the early afternoon. Besides the blind turn there were no other environmental factors involved in the accident.","By all accounts I did everything I could have to avoid the accident. I was driving a safe speed on the right side of the road. I was not affected by fatigue or road conditions. However the following day the district had a safety stand-down where we discussed driving procedures and safe practices.    One of the things that I took away from this is to continue to drive slowly and continue to stay on the right side of the road when driving on winding dirt roads. It wouldn't have avoided the accident in this case but I think that the outcome could have been much worse.","12/21/2005 00:00"

The local residences had back fired from behind they homes on the night of 11/26/05 all the way to the head of Adam Springs Hollow. The fire was around 200 acres when the crew arrived.

The IC on the fire had planned to use an old strip mine road for a control line and was in the process of burning out this road when the crew noticed a lot of smoke from below them. At first they thought it may be from their burn out. But as the smoke grew larger, the IC drove his truck around to check and see. What he found was a guy on a 4-wheeler setting fire along the road below the crew. The IC tried to catch the guy on the 4-wheeler and advised the crew what was going on.

The crew did not have enough time to reach a safety zone and laid down in the road as the flame front passed over them. Luckily the crew escaped with injuries. Due to large number of fires, there were only 3 crew members and the IC on the fire at the time so a good lookout was not in place.

The deficiencies identified here were not mitigated prior to the execution of the prescribed burn.....

________________________________________________

'When the Space Shuttle Challenger blew up on January 25, 1986, the nation was stunned. However, the accident did not come as a major surprise to the engineers with Morton Thiokol. They had tried to warn NASA officials of the dangers with a launch on that cold January morning. Their concerns were ignored......

We continually counsel our subordinates to speak up when they observe an unsafe action. Knowing that what I am writing won't be accepted well, it requires personal courage for me to speak my mind on this subject.

With the recent plans to carry out the Topeka Burn I identified safety concerns relating to a lack of adequate planning for public safety and possible evacuation scenarios. I have personally seen two previous Topeka burn projects get out of control and the proximity of this burn to the South Rim Village leaves little margin for error. I strongly believe the following critical issues need to be addressed or resolved prior to any follow-up burning attempts on this or any other burn projects which have the potential to directly impact the South Rim Village.

1. Evacuation Plan- The revised Park Evacuation Management Plan needs to be signed by the Superintendent. We have spent two years making improvements to this plan and conducting training exercises to test the accuracy of this revised plan. Failing to approve the plan in advance increases our agency liability.

2. Evac Route Signage- Installation of permanent evacuation route signage on South Rim roads. This deficiency was identified in the out-sourced Urban Interface Safety Review and has not been completed.

3. Structural Fire Staffing- Prior to initiating a burn effort, Emergency Services should notified with adequate advance notice (2-3 days) to assemble necessary structural fire resources for stand-by efforts. The recent scenario of being notified on the morning of a planned burn is simply short-sighted.

4. Evacuation ICP- Prior to initiating a burn effort, an incident command post needs to be identified and activated for the purpose of possible evacuation efforts. This includes notifying members of a designated evacuation incident command staff, who should be part of the incident briefing associated with the burn effort. Front-loading this effort, rather than scrambling to play catch-up will assure us far better results.

5. Incident Action Plan- The IAP for the burn should include a review of transition to incident organization involving an evacuation and be distributed to involved personnel. During the recent burn efforts I had Park Dispatch asking me why they had not been provided a copy of the IAP.

6. Distribution of Nomex PPE- A previous lesson learned from the Long Jim Burn was that law enforcement personnel suddenly conscripted to man traffic control points should already have Nomex PPE with them. During the recent Topeka black-lining project, South Rim rangers went to the Wildland Fire Cache but could not obtain PPE because everyone was out in the field. We need to resolve this previously identified deficiency in advance.

7. Pre-Planning Efforts Incorporate Public Safety- The degree of pre-planning work that a prescribed burn involves is huge. Unfortunately the public safety/evacuation component has not been directly incorporated into the planning efforts of the burn. Besides written plans this includes conducting another tabletop as mandated by the Deputy Superintendent.

I know that I am not the only protection employee that felt uncomfortable with the recent burn efforts. We were put behind the power curve in a situation that was self-generated. We can do better. Before we initiate another burn in close proximity to the Village I urge us to resolve these issues.","The suggested corrective actions are outlined in the message above.    I made verbal contact and put my concerns in writing to the responsible individuals one week in advance of the prescribed burn project.","11/21/2005 00:00"

This base station still can not communicate with the consoles at Great Plains Dispatch. Great Plains Dispatch does all initial attack and extended attack dispatching for the Nebraska National Forest. Currently the resources that work in the Chadron area are contacting Great Plains Dispatch through the Fall River base station. This only works well when there is relatively light radio traffic. In the event of two or more initial attacks or a combination of prescribed fires and initial attacks it is likely that resources in the Chadron area would not be able to contact Great Plains Dispatch.","After many conversations with the local radio technician it appears the only reasonable solution is to redesign/reprogram the network the radio traffic utilizes to access Great Plains Dispatch Center.    I submitted a SAFENET on July, 8. I spoke with the local radio technician and he informed me that ISO had suggested we purchase additional circuits to alleviate the congestion problem. The local phone provider estimated it would take three additional circuits at a cost of $6,900 a month. This was an unacceptable solution. I spoke with the local radio technician and he informed me that he had spoke with a 'network' person in the ISO organization and they had stated that a redesign and reprogramming of the network to make the radio transmissions a priority would solve our problem.

I have observed on IMT incidents on multiple occasions the consumption of alcoholic beverages by aircraft pilots and helitack while assigned to an incident. I have only observed them doing so in their out-of-service hours.

The IHOG does not address alcohol consumption by pilots or helitack while assigned to incidents.

When I asked an AOBD about this, he said to refer to the FAA regulations.

The FAA regulations state '8 hours from bottle to throttle'.

This is not good enough.

If a pilot were to consume a large quantity of alcohol, ending at 2200 hours, their bodies would not eliminate all of the alcohol by 0600 the following morning. They would still have enough alcohol in their system to be declared legally drunk for driving a commercial vehicle .04 (1-2 drinks for a 160 lb. man). The body normally eliminates/converts alcohol at one drink (1 1/2 ounces of grain alcohol) per hour. 8 hours would eliminate 12 ounces of alcohol or 8 drinks (beer, whiskey, etc.). A pilot or helitack crewman consuming over 8 drinks the night before would still have alcohol in their systems at 0600; perhaps enough to exceed the .04 legal limit for commercial operators.","Establish a NWCG policy that states pilots and helitack are not to consume alcohol while assigned to an incident, even in their off-shift hours.

Employ the use of breathalyzers at air tanker bases and helibases for pilots and helitack crews. Prior to flying pilots and helitack personnel would have to pass a breathalyzer test.    I have repeatedly attempted to resolve this problem for over 20 years with no success.

Alcohol consumption by pilots and helitack crews occurs on every incident.

If the NWCG cards pilots and aircraft for wildland fire incidents over and above FAA regulations, why can't the NWCG do the same for alcohol use on incidents over and above FAA regulations?

Commercial airline pilots found to be under the influence of alcohol while flying has been in the national news lately. I hope the same doesn't happen in the wildland fire community.

The problem will not go away, probably ever. But the NWCG can make the effort to reduce the risk.","02/15/2005 00:00"

This has effectively shut down that repeater from our use or any user out in the field until the same frequency(s) are programmed into the Grizzly Peak Station, which all transmissions relay through and programmed into BDC. Depending on what actual day in Nov. this was done, it has been almost two months that this frequency has been down. Dispatch was never notified about this change until it just happened to be mentioned matter of factly at this meeting. We have not been told when the rest of this process will be completed.","First and foremost, dispatch should have been notified that a change in frequency(s) was going to happen. Second, the change should have been started and finished within an acceptable time frame or not started at all. With winter time conditions up on the mountain tops now, it could be another several months before this is completed. This overall project was started almost 1 year earlier. It was decided to hold off on changing the frequencies until after the main fire season, which is a good decision. Unfortunately that leaves / left a very short window of opportunity to start and finish this portion of the project before the winter weather set in on the mountain tops. There were some completion dates given out at the 1-5-06 meeting, but these are very weather dependant during the winter and spring in MT.    There is no way to resolve what has happened in Nov. until the radio technician can get up to the rest of the mountain tops and complete the frequency change. Somehow there has to be better communications between the Users and the Radio Shop. Don't start a project of this importance and size if you can't finish it in a reasonable amount of time.

We were given the forest frequencies and maps to use while on assignment there and had no trouble figuring out and using their radio system. We were able to program the local frequencies in to our handheld radios and they worked fine. Our mobile radios are the new Vertex mobiles that are not field programmable. We were therefore unable to use the local radio system in our vehicles without holding a handheld out the window to get clear enough reception to talk with Cleveland Dispatch.

During the past 7 to 10 days the repeaters themselves have become an issue. Resources in the fields are having a hard time communicating with each other, even if they are within line of site.

No warning was given to the Food Unit that spray operations were going to take place near personnel and eating areas.

A plan should be in place to shut down the serving line, cover exposed food, and move personnel under cover.

Also, a ground control spotter should be on site to fine tune spray operations and provide current wind direction and wind speed to the pilot, so that flight patterns can be adjusted to account for drift and direct spray patterns away from exposed personnel.","IMT team personnel should have been notified of pending aerial application of insecticides, and this information including pesticide label and associated MSDS sheets should have been available to all incident personnel.

Communications with the fire were achieved only with the use of multiple human repeaters. Although none of the 10 Standard Orders were violated nor were any of the 18 Watch Outs unmitigated, they were jeopardized on every shift.

10 Standards:

1. Very difficult to inform crews on the fire of weather conditions and forecasts. Achieved through human relays.

3. Difficult to communicate FBAN forecasts to crews and line overhead.

7. Maintain prompt communications.......... Communication directly with line overhead from ICP required human repeaters. Satellite Phones were utilized but ICP could not call the fire via sat phone. Human repeaters had to call line overhead and ask for them to call ICP via sat. phone. Sat. phone connections were iffy and often required multiple phone calls to complete the communication.

8. Clear instructions were extremely difficult to give via sat. phone and human repeater.

18 Watch Out Situations:

Instructions and assignments not clear. Extremely difficult to mitigate.

Mitigation measures implemented.

Sat. phones. iffy and still required radio relays to implement.

Human repeaters and relays. Multiply the potential for communications mistakes.

All of these communications problems would not have existed if the Ranger District had in place a radio repeater that covered the fire area.

At about 1330 I went back down the fence line to check the piles we had burned earlier in the day and found a previously undetected spot fire that was approaching 1/4 acre. I tried calling each member of my crew on my radio and I got no response on any channel. I was about to go back for them, when one of them began walking in my direction because he had seen the smoke. I asked him if he heard me on the radio, and he said they all had heard a buzzing noise but did not hear me. We put a line around the spot fire, then began radio checks. We only heard a buzz when calling one another. One of the crew took his battery off and noticed a dark coating on the contacts on the back of the battery (rechargeable type). He lightly scraped the coating off with a pocketknife and tried again. This time we could hear him. We all did the same and the radios worked.

Our guess is that the coating on the contacts could have been caused by the heavy smoke, dust and heat we were working in and since the radios were directly exposed to it in our chest harnesses.

Later that week I had trouble communicating with a crew from another agency that was using Racal radios. They could hear me loud and clear but I could not hear them at all.

Conditions were appropriate for jump operations. The first two pairs (sticks) of jumpers deployed normal. In the third stick, the second jumper opened, checking and saw he had a good canopy overhead, then noticed that the connector links on his left set of risers were still tied together. Under normal openings, the connector links would be separate by a couple of feet.

The connector links are the hardware used to hold the suspension lines to the risers. Rigging protocol requires that the connector links be tied together along with the flap that closes the deployment bag. This bag contains the canopy and suspension lines. The jumper had a complete canopy and noticed only minimal extra resistance from the steering line on that side. He landed without incident.

The rigger had met the Region 4 Smokejumper Standards for being able to rig Main Canopies earlier this year. This canopy was rigged at a Spike Base on a makeshift table. A Senior Rigger was overseeing the rigging operation. After further review at the jump spot and back in the McCall Parachute Loft, it was determined that the rigger had improperly tied off the connector links on the parachute. No other conditions other than human error contributed. There were three additional canopies by this rigger on the shelves in McCall, these were broken down and inspected.

On the Alpine Incident this past summer I was on a handcrew that was spiked out for 6 days. We worked 16 hour shifts and we were away from any source of electricity. I had one Racal hybrid battery and two rechargeable batteries as emergency batteries. I felt it was imperative that I had my radio on 5 watts of power to keep in radio communication with adjoining forces. Due to the long shifts I was unable to keep the hybrid battery charged up. The battery guarantees 14 hours of operation. The extra hours on the shift put the battery power at a deficit and after a few days I had to use my rechargeable batteries to allow the hybrid battery to 'Catch Up'.

The lesson I learned is that you need at least 2 hybrid batteries on assignments. This will allow time for the batteries to fully recharge. Also it takes a truck load of batteries to keep the recharge process going. Thales recommends a new set of AA batteries at the end and beginning of each shift too recharge the hybrid. Optimistically for one hybrid battery this would be 16 batteries a day or 224 batteries on a 14 day assignment, however the quality of AA batteries that are distributed on large fires could result in higher battery use. This number of AA batteries will have to be doubled when you carry two hybrid batteries.

My coworkers reported similar findings on the hybrid batteries this summer on wildfire assignments. It should be a heads up to overhead type positions for resupplying batteries to handcrews.","An alternate brand of radio that requires fewer AA batteries and more information to line officers on Racal’s Battery consumption.    To solve the Racal battery recharge issue I have purchased an additional hybrid battery so I have two Racal Hybrid batteries. I haven’t found a reasonable way to slow down the consumption of AA batteries.

I have notified my District FMO and my Zone FMO. This information was past on the Planning, Operations, and Safety branch of the USFWS at NIFC. The reply I received was that the Racal hybrid battery met the NIFC battery requirements requested by both the BLM and USFS engineers that were part of the DOI Team for the DOI contract.

Crew Boss had her priority set to TAC 2 on her Vertex radio. She was scanning several frequencies. While talking to her Crew Boss Trainee on TAC 2, the lookout, who was on TAC 5 (command repeater channel), broke through, over-riding her communication with her Crew Boss Trainee on her priority channel.

POTENTIAL ISSUE

How to prevent inter-crew radio communication problems involving VERTEX programming and settings?

FOLLOW-UP

Crew Boss discussed issue with Safety Officer, who discussed problem with Radio Tech. Safety Officer also experimented with settings on several other fires. Observations included:

1) VERTEX Instructions - VERTEX radio programming and use instructions are unclear. This is not just a non-Radio Tech issue. For example, experienced state agency Radio Tech had difficulty interpreting instructions provided to users when had to program VERTEX's on another fire;

2) VERTEX Training - Reduction in Radio Techs has decreased radio training updates and availability of Radio Techs for formal and informal training sessions;

3) VERTEX Programming and Settings - Flexibility of VERTEX programming means that some radios will be programmed differently than other radios and the buttons are not specifically marked (e.g. 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'). This is particularly the case for 'Dual Watch' and 'Talk Around';

4) Complexity of VERTEX Features - What gives the VERTEX some of its flexibility means that one button does more than one thing (one press, two presses etc.).","SUGGESTIONS

1) Instructions - Rewrite VERTEX instructions to make them understandable to a non-Radio Tech audience, and ensure all users have copies and access. A small, plasticized version that can carry in glove-compartments, radio harnesses, vest pockets etc. is preferred as well as web access to reprint more;

2) Training - Ensure radio training is done yearly for fire and non-fire personnel. People who do not use the radio consistently are having difficulty remembering what features to use and when;

3) Programming and Settings - Agree on settings and only change annually, so can receive training, instead of mid-year. Also consider modifying buttons so they are not generic, and an intermittent user can interpret and understand (perhaps means clear instructions attached to the back of the radio);

4) Multi-Function Buttons - Make instructions clearer or reprogram so eliminates the fumbling on one press, two presses etc.

2)    See narrative above. The recommended corrective actions involve factors beyond the control of the Crew Boss.","09/14/2005 00:00"

When we arrived with another engine that was ordered we found that the helicopter manager had no current needs for us. I talked to the local patrol and he asked if we could patrol the area. As I got back on the road I called dispatch on the phone due to poor commo, the terrain made it difficult to hit the repeater. I called to inform them of our situation and asked if there was a certain area they would like us to patrol since I was not familiar with the area. The girl on the phone said that she was unfamiliar with the area as well so that we should patrol what ever area we felt was getting lightning. I decided to patrol a near by canyon road called Lee Canyon. The communications from Vegas Dispatch got scratchy as we drove up the canyon. I soon realized that I was not able to hit a repeater, yet I had cell service. Not long after that Vegas started dispatching a new fire that was in my response area. At times I could only hear half of the radio transmissions. I could hear that Vegas was trying repeatedly to reach resources but unable to. I was worried that I was one of those resources unable to hear dispatch. I turned around and began driving back towards the highway hoping to have better commo. Since I had cell service I called Vegas dispatch hoping they could assist me with my communications problem, let them know where I was located and if I was where they wanted me to be.

A woman answered the phone with 'Vegas Dispatch.' I told her that I was calling because I had poor commo, I was concerned and I wanted to make sure I was where they wanted me. She responded with rude frustration in her voice telling me, 'Don't call in here, if we want to talk to you we will call you on the radio, you won't go to a fire unless I say so.' When I tried to respond she slammed the phone down and hung up. Confused I called back hoping to hear a more helpful voice. The next call began with, 'Vegas Dispatch, this is XXX.' I identified myself and asked if she was the woman who had just hung up on me, she simply said, 'no but I'm going to right now' and hung up a second time. I called back again and the phone was answered by another woman. She was very friendly, I asked if I could please talk to the dispatch center manager, she responded with 'yes, one moment' and put me on hold. A second later a woman came on the phone and once again identified herself as XXX. I told her that I did not appreciate her hanging up on me, that it was a safety issue, she cut me off and said, 'Don't call in here again, I'm going to tell (another dispatch person) about you guys.' She then hung up for a third time.

I called 7502, the FMO. I explained the situation to him. He apologized and said that she has done that before. He asked if I would document and send it to him. He informed me that 'XXX' was not the center manager, it was another individual and that if I need to call in again I should ask for him. I asked 7502 where he would like my engine since he was the duty officer and I was unable to communicate with dispatch. He sent me to another area to patrol.

When I arrived to that area I detected four new smokes. I still had poor commo and called dispatch on the phone. When I called I asked for Dennis the center manager. I told him that I had poor commo which was the reason I had originally called in. He apologized and said that XXX had a habit of being rude, and that I can call in any time and ask to speak only to him. Through out the initial attack of the small lightning fires, I regain adequate radio commo. I called in a number of times per the dispatch manager,s request to give him fire updates and info, a few times XXX answered and I had to argue with her to be able to speak to the center manager .

The fire was being managed by a fire-use team.

Background information: This day was our 14th day on tour. The last 5 days and 4 nights where spent spiked-out. The temperature at night was very cold and several people where coming down with a cough and general fatigue.

I felt that starting our drive on 7/28/2005 and stopping in 2-3 hours at a hotel would allow a good nights rest, a hot meal, and shorten the drive the next day to ensure we had alert, well rested drivers.

Upon completion of all demob tasks I requested of the IC that we be authorized to start our drive home now due to the amount of day left and the length of the drive (approximately 10 hours). I explained that starting the drive tonight would shorten the drive for the next day, and allow for a good nights rest. The IC understood my safety concerns and took everything into consideration. After a bit of debating the IC informed me that dinner meals had already been ordered for my crew and the cost of letting us leave tonight would be about $2000 for hotels and per-diem, therefore we where not authorized to leave but stay the night at the ICP and leave in the morning.

On 7/29/2005 at 0600 my crew left the Falls Creek fire and reached our home unit at 1730.","There has been rash of driving incidents related to fire fighters returning from fires. These accidents can generally be attributed to cumulative fatigue and work stress after being on the line. I was somewhat appalled that the incident was more concerned about saving $2000 than to allow a crew to break up a long drive, get a hot meal, and a good nights rest. Driving 11 1/2 hours is a long drive for the most alert, well rested drivers.

Our bus was part of a convoy with two other buses carrying crews demobing from Cedar City to Las Vegas. Our route was south on I-15. During our drive several startling events occured:

-Bus driver missed off ramp that the lead bus had turned off and proceeded to slow the bus down to 15 MPH and was going to stop. I told the driver that slowing to that speed on an interstate with a posted limit of 70 MPH was not safe and to continue on to the next exit where we could get turned around where we could meet up with the other buses in the convoy. Prior to finding the next available exit, the driver started to attempt to cross the median to back track. I stopped this action and told her to continue until the next exit.

-The bus's CB radios did not work, so crew bosses on the buses used their portable radios to communicate for the convoy, adding to our responsibility.

-Throughout our trip, the driver repeatedly drifted over the fog line into the rumble strip and overcorrecting in a rough fashion to get back into the lane.

-Throughout the trip, the driver would look back at me and the other passengers in the front seats for 10-15 seconds at time, diverting her attention from the road.

-During our travel down the Virgin River Canyon, the driver erratically moved from the slow lane to the fast lane to avoid a broken down truck pulled off on the shoulder, nearly hitting the truck and cutting off traffic in the fast lane.

-Other buses in the convoy had to repeatedly pull over to wait or speed to catch up because the driver's speed was so inconsistent. (I could see her speedometer from where I was sitting.)

-During heavy traffic in Las Vegas, the driver would signal late and cut other traffic off during lane changes and exhibited extreme nervousness and doubt while navigating through that heavy traffic.

The other crew bosses in the convoy buses expressed their concern to me and my supervisor about our bus driver's actions. Numerous crewmembers of mine also expressed concern for their safety and the safety of other drivers on our route.","Have all contract drivers be tested and trained to our agencies' standard of driving and have an agency employee certify that driver's ability and level of competency on a annual basis.

Additional resources responded to the fire (Helicopter N97? with crew) near Twin Falls, ID. A dip site was selected near the fire and both helicopters began bucket drop operations 30 minutes after dispatch. The fire was fueled by a stack of hay bales. The surrounding area had irrigation canals, irrigated fields, water bodies, and other sources of water in the area. The dip site was jokingly called a sewage lagoon by the crews and worse. During the operation you could have taken you Incident Response Pocket Guide and thrown it out the window. Those responding were clueless about which dip site to select. Radio communications from air to ground was not working because radios were not properly cloned. The manager and crew failed to open the bambi bucket properly with center ring pulled out enough to engage the aluminum spokes. This caused much spillage and slinging sewage sludge everywhere. Preceding the second dip or during filling the N49MA manager and crew had to redeploy a nasty bucket with bio-solids and unknown substances. The weather was hot and sunny. The fire was putting up a vertical column of white smoke that could be easily seen from the Twin Falls Tanker Base. At 2100 IA resources returned to the helibase. I along with other personnel was ordered to clean and disinfect the contaminated buckets and gear. The splash back residue from the buckets left an oily residue on nomex clothing after drying or unknown origin. Crew members complained about eye irritation and the helicopter mechanic complained about possible damage to the bucket and equipment. I was more concerned about personnel involved, exposure to unknown pathogens, lack of proper PPE, not following proper procedures to set up a decontamination station, possible forage & food contamination, and environmental impacts. In addition if hazardous gases such as dioxin that may have been released during the fire, fire fighters should be fully informed, aware of the dangers, chemicals, pathogens and wear approved PPE. I mentioned my safety concerns fellow personnel. The next day, I was asked to leave and received my return tickets to my home base.

Managers need to be more aware of what pathogens they are exposing crews to and how to follow proper paper work procedures in documenting exposures. We can not spread hazardous material all over creation just because there is a fire. Note: It would be a good idea for everyone involved to have the appropriate shots , revisit the helicopter crew member task book, gain more awareness working under the rotors, and learn more about approved PPE requirements. Operations should make sure proper PPE is available to fire fighters on incidents. Managers should have verified the pilot was carded to spread bio-solids and helicopter placarded with bio-hazard symbol. The proper paper work and permits should have been completed by managers.

I was working at my desk at the Roosevelt Ranger Station, monitoring both my handheld and base set radios (both Bendix-Kings). Although the transmission from Peachville Helibase to Phoenix Dispatch was slightly 'scratchy', it was readable and concise. The Helibase requested that Phoenix Dispatch launch a medical helicopter to the fire area, with instructions to contact helicopter '2HL' (a medium helicopter working the fire) on the designated air-air VHF frequency. After the initial call from Peachville Helibase, Tonto Dispatch requested 'clarification', as they were unable to correctly decipher the entire message. Peachville helibase repeated the message (which again was slightly scratchy, but readable on the radios in my office). Again, Tonto Dispatch called back to Peachville helibase indicating that they were unable to copy the entire message (talking with the Dispatcher later, I was informed that they were only hearing 'bits and pieces' of the message). At this point I dialed the phone number for Tonto Dispatch and relayed the information to the dispatchers. As I was dialing the phone, an Engine Captain from the Pleasant Valley Ranger District attempted to contact the dispatch office on Tonto Forest repeater channel 6, tone 3, to relay the same information (evidently he was also hearing the Peachville helibase loud and clear. My concern is that the Forest repeater system is NOT working to acceptable standards, which DID and WILL in the future continue to pose a SERIOUS SAFETY issue for the firefighters and other employees working in the field. The Forest has had an ongoing problem with the radio system, which only seems to have gotten worse with the advent of 'narrow banding'. Even with a new radio console in the Dispatch office, communications throughout the Forest are 'hit and miss' at best. It is my conservative estimate that 75% of all transmissions from field units to the Dispatch office are asked for 'clarification' ('unit calling Phoenix, please repeat, you were unreadable') at least once, and often many times. The Peachville medical incident is a wake-up call that must NOT go unheeded. Viable communication is the cornerstone to fireline safety. The operational viability of the current radio system on the Tonto is in direct conflict with the basic safety philosophies that govern wildland firefighting (LCES, 10 & 18, etc.).","The Forest needs a total overhaul of the current mountain-top repeater system.

I was serving as the ICT3 during the operational period from 0600 to 2000 on 07/24/2005. At the time I took command, the fire was approximately 1000 acres and consisted of the main fire and 2-3 large spot fires approx. 200-300 yards in front (south) of the main fire's head. Upon my arrival, the tail and west flanks of the fire appeared to be relatively secure due to the abundance of natural fuel breaks and the inability of the fire to spread through the grass/sagebrush uplands. The east and south perimeters were located in the timbered bottom areas. Fire behavior here was light to moderate with occasional torching occurring in the juniper jackpots beneath the pine/fir over story. The topography in the area is typical of the Missouri River breaks and consists of large rolling grass/sagebrush uplands which are deeply incised by steep, often timbered, drainages. The main fire head and the spot fires were all basically down in the bottom of one of these drainages (Sourdough Crk.).

At approximately 0900 I flew a recon flight with 2 of the OPSCs from the Type 2 incident management team that was currently managing the nearby McArthur Fire and was going to be taking the Knox Fire over on 7/25/05. We agreed on a general strategy to wait for the fire to burn through the timbered bottoms and catch it up on the grass/sage uplands. We also discussed a couple of areas where there were potential opportunities to burn out, either along two-track roads (east perimeter) or along the edge of the timber near the tops of the draw. The southern perimeter caused the most concern as a good anchor point was not readily apparent. The OPSCs also informed me that they would be available to return to the fire in a couple of hours to help with the day's operations along with several DIVSs, a DNRC strike team of Type 6 engines, and at least one additional helicopter (all resources currently assigned to the McArthur Fire).

After landing at approx. 0920, I noticed that we had favorable conditions to burn out a piece of line in the northeast corner of the unit. I placed an individual in charge of lighting operations with support from two engines. At approx. 0940, a Type-3 helicopter arrived at Knox Helibase. I went to tie-in with them at the helibase and gave them a briefing on the fire and instructed them to stand-by for further instruction. While visiting with the crew from the helicopter (approximately 1030), I was contacted by a visiting ATGS from Miles City, he informed me that he was on scene and wondering what the plan was. I informed him that our general strategy was to catch the fire in the grass/sage uplands and to generally let the fire burn out of the timber. I went on to state that we did not want to 'throw a lot of mud' at the fire down in the timbered bottoms. Finally, I asked air attack to recon the fire and use their best discretion as to the effectiveness of helicopter water drops. At approx. 1040, I left the helibase and proceeded to return to the northeast portion of the fire where the burn-out was proceeding nicely. I got another call from the ATGS stating that he thought we might be able to use the helicopter bucket to effectively cool off the fire in the bottom along the southern perimeter, particularly if we could get another helicopter from the McArthur fire to work in tandem. He also stated that it would be good to get some engine folks in the area to work the water. I agreed to 'drop a few buckets and see how it goes'. I then contacted another individual who was supervising operations along the north and west perimeters and asked if he had an engine or two that he could spare to go support the helicopter bucket work. He stated that he would send an engine and 3-4 personnel from a Helitack to tie-in with a local landowner on the Knox Ridge Road and that the landowner would guide them into a two-track ridge road along the west side of the fire which would eventually lead them to a point just above where the helicopters were working. On my way back to the north east corner of the fire, I ordered the additional helicopter from McArthur helibase. At approximately 1100, I tied in with the individual handling lighting operations at the burnout in the NE corner. Things looked good at the burnout so I decided to proceed southerly along the eastern perimeter searching for an anchor point and potential line across the southern perimeter. At approximately 1140, I got a call from the ATGS and was informed that things were looking pretty good and that he had a visual on the engine and pick-up that was working its way down the ridge road to the location above where the helicopters were dropping. After I got a mile or so down the two track along the east side, I got a radio call from one of the OPSC stating that they, along with the DIVSs and the strike team of engines had arrived at the incident. I informed them that I would be at the northeast corner of the fire in approximately 10 minutes. I then headed back towards the Knox Ridge Road to tie in w/ the OPSCs, DIVSs and engine strike team. While en route back to the Knox Ridge Road (approx 1215), I overheard some radio traffic between the ATGS and an engine about accessing the area where the helicopters were working. I recall the engine boss for the engine asking the ATGS if they would be working direct or indirect. The response from the ATGS was 'direct'. I don't recall what was specifically said next, but I do recall several minutes of communications between the engine boss and the ATGS as to the best route down to the fire, etc. It soon became apparent to me that the engine boss was concerned with the safety of the assignment as directed by the ATGS, as on several occasions he made statements such as: 'It's awfully steep and thick down there' and 'I'm not too comfortable putting a crew down there, etc.' I don't recall the exact response of the ATGS to the comments made by the engine boss, but they were generally comments that seemed to understate the hazards perceived by the engine boss and encouraged him to proceed with the assignment. I was then going to call the engine boss and inform him that the DIVSs had arrived and I was just about to brief them and send one his way to help assess the situation, but before I could, one of the other engine bosses on the fire called the engine boss questioning the situation and supported his decision not to go down into the drainage. After that radio transmission, I then raised the engine boss and directed him to come back out to the Knox Ridge Road and tie-in with the DIVS from the IMT that I had assigned to that part of the fire. The engine boss acknowledged and then the engine and the pick-up being driven by the AZ helitack crew proceeded out to the Knox Ridge Road where they met up with the DIVS. At approximately 1300, the aircraft w/ the ATGS transitioned with a replacement ATGS and aircraft and headed back to Lewistown for fuel. Shortly after this, the DIVS, the engine, and the AZ helitack crew proceeded back down the ridge road on the west side of the fire and discovered that fire behavior in the area where they had earlier been directed had increased significantly and that the fire was now spreading rapidly down canyon to the south and up slope to the west. The crew spent the remainder of the operational period up on the ridge road supporting the helicopters that were now suppressing spot fires across the ridge road in the SW corner of the fire. Operations proceeded normally from this point on and no further safety concerns were identified","Clearly the engine boss made the right decision. Shortly after the decision was made to retreat, the area was engulfed in flames.

Possible failures which occurred that led to this near-miss situation include:

Failure on the ICT3's part to make clear the objective of letting the fire burn in the timber to the ATGS, or failure of the ATGS to follow this direction. (Ensure instructions are clear and understood.)

Failure of the ATGS to recognize a high-risk / low probability of success situation (Initiate all action on current and EXPECTED fire behavior).

It is my best guess that what actually happened was, that the fire and topography from the ATGSs perspective did not appear to be nearly as difficult to maneuver or as hazardous as the conditions actually were on the ground. All fire personnel and particularly those performing aerial supervision of fire incidents need to be reminded of this potential discrepancy in risk assessment. Aerial supervisors need to be reminded that those folks on the ground actually have the best feel for what conditions actually are on the ground, and when it becomes apparent that the folks on the ground have safety concerns that those folks performing aerial supervision do not place additional pressure on those ground resources to proceed.    I resolved the problem by directing the engine back onto the Knox Ridge Road and having them tie-in with a DIVS for re-assessment.

In the future, as the ICT3, I would not have allowed that bucket work in the timbered bottom to occur in the first place. I would have issued clearer direction to all personnel (particularly the ATGS) that the plan was to post all personnel up on the ridges and wait for the fire to come-out onto the grass /sagebrush uplands were it could be easily extinguished.","08/01/2005 00:00"

The four crews, a division chief, and an environmental employee met at the burn site at 0830 hours. An informal briefing occurred which included communications, PPE, environmental hazards, a map of the area to be burned, strategy, and assignments. Two Captains were each given division assignments. At the end of the briefing a second division chief arrived at the site. At that time the two division supervisors each had short meetings with the crews assigned to them. My crews' particular division assignment was to get out ahead of the other engine crews and start lighting and they would tie into our burn. Other topics included holding the road we were burning from, staying hydrated, and switching off burners if we got fatigued. We then made our way out to the site where the lighting would commence. This area was a two track road with no turn arounds because of environmental concerns. My engine was the last one to reach the two track road. When we arrived the other crews had already started to burn so there was no way to get around them. It was obvious that at this time all strategy and tactics that were discussed in the morning briefing had been thrown out the window. The two division supervisors ended up staying out front with the burners and never utilized the tactics that were discussed earlier in the morning.

Although there was no life threatening or near miss situations, the lack of communication, the absence of weather discussions, contingency plans, and medical evacuation is just a recipe for disaster.","A more formal briefing needs to be implemented. At no time was a weather discussion for the day mentioned. A spot weather forecast was also not available. In my opinion, I do not believe that the instructions regarding tactics and strategy were understood. I believe that an Incident Action Plan (IAP) also needs to be implemented for these types of annual burns. A map was made available but it was picture map taken from a high elevation. Topo maps would have been more acceptable. Contingency plans were not discussed and neither were medical evacuation plans.

IAPs should be made available so all the involved crews know and understand their assignment.    It was too late to resolve the problem on the day of the burn. The next shift I discussed with my supervisor the implementation of IAPs and formal briefings.

He was also assigned to as I.C. of the Schoolie Rim fire. He was not aware of being assigned to two fires until the morning briefing. Our initial assignment was to meet with the other resources and the division supervisor at the incident. We arrived at the incident at 0745, all resources except the DIVS were on scene. For approximately 20 minutes an engine from MT Hood National Forest tried to contact the DIVS or the IC and was unsuccessful. At this point the MT Hood engine and the four contract engines decided to begin taking action on the incident. I discussed with them that we need to wait for a supervisor and plan of action before engaging. The other engine captains agreed that we should wait, but they had been on this incident the last two days and knew what to expect. So, at 0815 the MT Hood engine, and 4 contract engines engaged the fire with no communication with supervisors or dispatch. At this time I tried to reach the IC on the BIA repeater and was unsuccessful. I than tried to reach Warm Springs fire dispatch and was unsuccessful. I was told by one of the other engines that dispatch probably wasn't in service yet. I than tried to call Warm Springs fire management on my cell phone. After three attempts, due to poor cell reception, I reached Warm Springs fire management. At 0830 I asked if an Incident commander or division supervisor was en route. I was told that the DIVS was 15 minutes away from the incident. At 0835 the IC contacted the MT Hood engine and one of the contract engines on the radio and notified them that the DIVS was now the IC and would arrive in 30 minutes. The DIVS arrived at 0930 and gave us the assignment of mopping up.

The original IC allowed action to take place on the incident, having never seen the fire and with out LCES in place.","Leadership, a plan, and LCES need to be in place before any action takes place on the incident.

Extreme fire behavior was witnessed at most of these fires. At least two fires pulled personnel out to safety zones due to fire behavior. Due to rapid fire growth several of these fires were deemed to be Type 3 or 2 incidents but due to lack of resources immediately available were still being managed by Type 4 Incident Commanders. Eventually all fires were included into the Sundance Complex. The main problem that was encountered was the fact that at least 4 fires were being run on the main repeater (North Zone Warren) and also on the same tactical channel (FS Work). The repeater channel was completely overwhelmed with traffic, and as some folks were unable to hit the repeater they had to use a human repeater which compounded the traffic even more. Several times traffic was missed due to incidents talking over each other both on the command and tactical frequencies. On at least one incident dispatch was unable to make contact with the IC for approx. one hour. Although it seemed that each fire handled the situation and ensured that LCES remained a priority for individuals on the fires, by not having good radio back to dispatch if there were an emergency need the individuals at the fire may have been left to handle it on their own.","Increase the capacity/range of the current repeater system. Add another repeater channel that could be used immediately during multiple incidents as a second, or back up command channel. Add several designated fire tactical channels that dispatch can assign (letting each incident choose their own tactical channel would still cause problems).

Each crewmember has been given a Racal radio, rechargeable battery, hybrid battery (combination rechargeable/AA batteries), and clamshell.

As ICT4(t) on the Neck Fire, I had significant safety concerns due to the lack of communications which occurred due to the use of my Racal radio. My concerns include the short duration of battery life, the length of time required to recharge each battery, and the incompatibility of Racal radios with the radios of the majority of the fire organization.

I started using my Racal radio at 0600, the beginning of the operational period for the Neck Fire 07/22/05, and continued using my radio through the operational period. At approximately 1600, I had used my rechargeable battery (which had been fully charged), my hybrid battery (which also had been fully charged and takes 5 or more hours to recharge), and one clamshell of AA batteries. The clamshell has a certain length per transmission before cutting off which required me to break my transmissions into sections. To my knowledge, not a single other firefighter present at the Neck Fire had a Racal radio, so I did not have access to additional rechargeable batteries or a battery charger.

My second concern involves the incompatibility of the Racal radios with radios of the majority of the fire organization, Bendix King. It is not possible to clone our radios with the radios of the majority of other firefighters. Each time our crew is dispatched off district either as an entire crew or as a single resource, it requires manually reprogramming the frequencies at each incident.","If Zion Helitack is provided with digital Bendix King radios instead of the Racal radios, then each crewmember would be confident in the reliability of the Bendix King batteries, especially knowing that AA batteries are available in the field and that the clamshells allow for communication as effectively as the rechargeable batteries.

Also, each crewmember would be able to clone his/her radio at each incident and use his/her Bendix Kings radio equipment interchangeably with other individuals on the fireline.    To resolve the problem while on the Neck Fire, I utilized the radio of the other ICT4.

I am submitting this SAFENET so that others in the fire organization will be aware of the safety concerns associated with the Racal radio.

I hope that in the future Zion Helitack will have an alternative means of communicating within our crew and with other resources for safety in operations, whether fire, search and rescue, or daily projects.

I also plan to inquire within Zion N.P. on the availability of Bendix King radios, which have been placed out of service due to the change over to Racal radios.","07/27/2005 00:00"

We have expressed concerns earlier as to capabilities of the system to meet our needs and have done some limited testing to confirm our fears. At this point in the summer we have had crews and engines return from off-forest assignments bemoaning the poor performance of the Vertek and unsafe environment created by having a marginal radio that couldn't be cloned. Many SAFENETS have been posted by returning crews.

Today, during routine fire operations, resources could not hear each other from other fires or locations on-forest and talking over each other to create problems for Dispatch. A lot of effort and air-time was devoted to having resources switch mountaintops and/or repeat messages in the hopes that maybe the third or fourth try might work. Again, this was with 3 small fires exhibiting low to moderate fire behavior. To illustrate how bad it was, one IC was talking to a Forest Lookout (also a repeater site for the system), and it was so poor that the Lookout asked the IC to switch to our Project Channel (a face-to-face freq) so they could complete commo.

Prior to leaving Washington we reviewed the great basin safety alert about fuel conditions and fire behavior. Numerous times briefings where requested through the staging area manager. We were finally given a briefing by a type 2 team that demobed off a fire and were sent to Color country staging at the middle school.

The facilities where inadequate for the number of personnel assigned to the staging area. There were approximately 600 people in staging with 1 functioning toilet out of 4 in the men’s room.

Water was in short supply as well. When we arrived we where instructed to fill our canteens out of the sink in the rest rooms and bottled water was limited and dehydration was a concern.

Shade consisted of 5 shade canopies to support 600 people. The result was sun exposure which Crew supervisors tried to mitigate by purchasing sunscreen from the local mini mart. Sunscreen was not provided for 4 days and resulted in a number of sunburns.

While in staging NWR #5 and #6 consolidated orders for supplies to be fire ready which consisted of hand tools, fusees, batteries and saw fuel.

At approximately 1200 hrs July 20th, 2005 a wildland fire was reported in  a fire protection district in Colorado. Shortly after arrival, this district  requested mutual aid from an other Fire Protection District (a 100% volunteer organization) and other county fire departments. One firefighter and a deputized citizen responded in a type 6 engine.  Approximately 10 to 15 minutes later another firefighter  (FF2) reported he was also responding in a second type 6 engine.

FF2 reported to the IC face to face. The IC told him to go to the South end of the fire and begin operations.  He informed the IC that he was alone in the truck and to send him additional crewmen as soon as possible. He then drove to the South end of the fire and began a one man operation.

After an undetermined amount of time the FF2 was then assigned to the East side of the fire by the IC. He moved his type 6 engine and continued his one man operation. While operating on the East side of the fire he over heard on the radio another fire unit report that they had been “burned over” on the North end of the fire. It was shortly after this radio report that he was reassigned to operate at the North end of the fire with the other engine. FF2 had been and was still operating with out any additional crewmen or attached to any other fire units. FF2 stated he never saw or linked up with the other engine.  Approximately 2-1/2 hours had transpired since FF2 had reported into to the IC.

Upon arrival at the North end of the fire FF2 set up operations by positioning his engine approximately 10 feet outside the fire line in the unburned fuel side and deploying a 1-1/2 inch hose line. He stated, he positioned the truck in the unburned fuel because the fire was “reburning” in the black.  He stated at the time the wind was erratic and swirling due to weather conditions. He estimated that winds were approximately 10 mph and flame lengths at the time were 2-3 feet in grass approximately 2 feet high. After operating for a few minutes he noticed that the fire had reversed direction and was burning toward the truck from about 10 ft away. The truck was positioned so that the driver’s side of the engine was flame side. The driver’s door had been left open as he had been working the hose line, driving forward and then getting out to work the hose line some more. He stated the fires approach was too rapid and to large for him to gain access through the drivers door so he ran to the passenger side, opened the door and started to climb across to the driver’s side. He stated that the force of the fire “blew” him out the passenger side setting his hair on fire. His comment to me when I was talking to him was that he “thought he was going to die.” He stated he thought the wind speed at this time to be around 50 mph. He stated he did the only thing he could remember which was to “Stop, Drop and Roll”.  Two nearby ranch hands, (unknown who) who were the only people in the area, went to find help. Finding the Fire Chief, just over a nearby hill, FF2 was transported back to the ICP where he was given treatment by paramedics and then transported to a local hospital via ambulance.

FF2 suffered 1st and 2nd degree burns to his left face, head and ear. Blistering to his lips, both of his hands and showed burns to the inside of his left nostril. He was kept for 7 hours under observation at the hospital to ensure that he didn’t have any significant damage done to his airway. The burns are not depilating enough at this time to require his continued hospitalization. At present FF2 has lost 1 day of work and is presently on prescribed pain medication.

FF2 was wearing only his issued yellow Nomex shirt, green wildland pants and a personal pair of sneakers. He stated he had left his issued helmet at home. His issued fire shelter, 2 – 1 quart canteens and harness system, gloves or goggles whereabouts at the time of the incident has not been determined by this writer. FF2 stated he was not wearing his gloves or goggles.  He has successfully completed S-130 and S-190 date unknown. This writer is also unaware if this firefighter has attended the yearly refresher as is required. I do not know if he is a current Red Card holder.

This writer is also unaware of any structures that were threatened. I have been told by several other sources that were on the fire that there was not.

FF2 sustained relatively minor damage and as I understand it still in service.

My major concern is that this was a near miss and could have ended tragically. As is almost always the case when tragedy strikes it is never one thing that was wrong. In this case it was;

FF2:

•	All of his PPE was not being worn

•	Operating alone

•	Uninformed on strategy, tactics, and hazards

•	Safety zones and escape routes not identified

•	Poor equipment positioning

•	Unaware of present weather conditions and uninformed about future weather events

•	Instructions and assignments not clear

•	Constructing fire line without a safe anchor point

•	Attempting frontal assault on fire

•	Unburned fuel between himself and the fire

•	Wind increased and changed direction

Incident Command Staff:

•	It is this writers understanding that IC personnel commanding this fire are not trained or certified in the NWCG positions they held

•	No safety oversight

•	Safety zones and escape routes not identified

•	Did not inform crews on strategy, tactics, hazards, fire behavior, or current or expected weather conditions

•	IAP missing or not communicated

•	Did not ensure instructions were understood

•	In this case suppression resources were inadequate. I don’t know about the rest of the fire.

•	Did not retain control at all times

•	Encouraged free lancing","Safety retraining for firefighters of this volunteer organization emphasizing;

•	The need and use of PPE

•	Not operating alone on a fire

•	Not operating with out clear and concise orders

•	Not free lancing

•	Not operating with out knowing the expected weather conditions

•	Ensuring escape routes and safety zones

•	Not deploying with out adequate personnel

Incident Command Staff should

•	Ensure that personnel operating on a wildland fire are trained and Red Carded for the position that they are operating in.

•	Reinforce the need for spot weather forecasts

•	Ensure crews are inform on strategy, tactics, hazards, fire behavior, or current or expected weather conditions

•	Ensure that all personnel on scene (a number of road graders and several dozer operators were operating on this fire with no training in wildland suppression or wildland PPE) have appropriate training.

•	A county wide adherence to NWCG standards, training and tactics    This writer has spoken in depth with the members of the volunteer organization Board of Directors. The Fire Board members are committed to improving the way the district does business so that this does not happen again. The over all problem is far greater then just this one district in that the fire department “power houses” in this county do not believe they have any need to follow any of the NWCG standards. Even to the point of still fighting wildland fires in structure gear. Such a “near miss” in my opinion will do little to change the attitudes of these leaders. It is my hope that pressure brought from the outside will have more success in changing these attitudes outside of the volunteer organization then I have personally had over the years.","07/23/2005 00:00"

I have other personnel on this incident which feel the same way.

On 7/19/2005 I was dispatched to the Martins Ferry area reported vegetation fire. At approximately 0730 am when I arrived at the martins ferry bridge I contacted the (IC) Incident Commandeer on the appropriate radio frequency. I was told to standby until they found a way into this fire. After about 1.5 hours I was told to proceed up the Bald Hills road about 3 to 4 miles and ended up driving up the road about 10 miles before finding where the IC was located. Then was then told to stage there until the road was cleared by a hand crew to make it passable. I waited there for another 4 hours by this time in was getting to be around 1400 hours and very warm. At this time the IC had a Helicopter crew and 1 CDF hand crew working the fire and six air tankers while the rest of us were waiting to proceed down this one lane brushy road. While traveling down the road we came across a very muddy part in the road it was very hard to get through that area. After the engines and water tender made it through the first time the road was pretty much impassable to get back out if there was an emergency. I informed the IC of the situation and I was told that when the dozer was done with his mission that he would be able to go back and work on that. So I talked with the dozer operator about 1 hour later and asked him if that information was relayed on to him and his reply was yes I was relieved with that part of it. Meanwhile I was talking with IC to see if there was a plan to get hose down to this fire and if he had been down to the fire to see what the fire was doing. The reply that was given to me was I think I have a plan and I almost made it down to the fire but I was about 100 yards away and I came back to the top to get with you folks to get some hose to the fire, he started to tell me the plan that was being made and I suggested to him that maybe we should have a briefing with all the crews that were going to be involved with doing this and the reply that I got was yes that is a great idea. While the IC was giving the briefing he was quite unsure of the decision that he had made. He kept saying I think we'll do it this way. That shows me uncertainty in his decision making process like he was unsure if him self or what he was trying to get these crews to do. The briefing lasted about 5 minutes and was very uninformative the IC at this point has still not seen the fire all the information given was given by the few people actually on the fire and air attack. There had been no weather taking on the fire he did not know exactly where the fire was actually at just that it was down this ridge. And he wasn’t real sure of all the safety concerns that were down there just that it was hot so drink lots of water and watch out for snakes. Did not tell where the escape route and safety zones were until he was asked then the reply was oh it will probably be in the black but was very uncertain. He informed the crews that putting in the hose lay that he was pretty sure that the retardant that was put down was holding the fire a bay and he thought it would be pretty safe to walk down into this fire. At this point we broke up and started the task that was given. I told my crew that with the situational awareness that I have gathered that we would carry hose down into this fire and if I did not feel comfortable when we arrived that we would turn right around and hike back out of the fire and that was agreed upon by all. While walking down to this fire we were walking through a incredible amount of blown down trees and a lot of dead slash on the ground so that would have made the escape very difficult if there just so happen to be a blow up in the fire. The line that was chosen to walk to fire was directly above the fire at this time the air attack was supposed to be the lookout but that was not clear to all the resources that were walking into the fire. Upon arriving at the fire there was a CDF hand crew captain there and asked if we were assigned to help him and his crew finish up cutting the hand line and I informed him that we were to lay hose around the fire that was our task. So at that point I informed my crew and one other engine crew to stay put while I walked this fire and seen for myself what was actually there before I put my crew in there to do any work. While walking the fire I informed my crew to head back to the top as we would need more hose to reach around this fire. There was no problem with that decision. While on the walk out my driver told me that it was a 15 to 20 minute walk out considering that you were not carrying anything. So that was put into consideration that the escape route was going to be back up the line and to the trucks as the burn that was told by the IC to be our safety zone was not a clean burn and had a high possibility of reburn if the right conditions would have arose. At this point I decided that it would be safe to proceed with our task. So after we had laid out all of our hose packs is when the IC had finally reached the fireline and his expression was oh my goodness this is a mess. I replied yes it is and asked him how the water shuttle was doing he replied that it was really slow and he did not know where the water tenders were at it was taking them a lot longer than expected. About that time I heard the water tender trying to get a hold of me as he could not reach the IC. I answered him and asked what’s up and he replied that he had been trying to reach the water tender now for about 15 minutes this wasn't the first time that the IC would not respond to radio transmissions it happened several time that shift. So the water tender told me that he had gotten stuck in the mud hole in the road that dozer supposedly had fixed. So I told him stand by and proceeded to call the IC and let him know what was going on with the water tender the IC replied that he would be right out to help with the problem. Now the road is completely blocked and he had no concern that was the only way out if something were to go wrong. It was about 1 hour after that he had received a call from my dispatcher requesting that we be released. So after the walk out we sat at the trucks for about 2 more hours before the road was fixed enough to get the engine's out of that road.

Bottom line is that the IC on this fire did not do a very safe job on this fire and the only ones that thought so were the USFS agency people all of the state folks were fine with his decision making process.","In the future it would be nice that all agencies Federal or State be trained the same in wildland fire situations so that everyone is having to follow all the same rules and guidelines. Such as having an IRPG Incident Response Pocket Guide, Follow the 5 steps of the Risk Management Process. etc    I resolved this problem by asking the right questions and gathering my own Situational Awareness to do the task at hand safely. The thing that needs to be changed is that all agencies federal and state have to follow all the same safety guidelines when it comes to fighting wild land fires.","07/20/2005 00:00"

For approximately one hour, the IC, and IC (T) were unable to converse on the mobile radios whatsoever. At several other points during the hike into the incident there was sketchy or no communication via the handheld radios in locations that separated individuals by less than 1/2 mile. Communication with dispatch was usually possible, and there was a 'human repeater' that was sometimes possible. However at some points the Vertex radios could not communicate with the human repeater with unbroken line of sight. The concern is that if a critical situation had arisen at any of the instances communication wasn't possible, we could have a huge safety issue. If there was a serious injury, it may not be possible to get a hold of the appropriate personnel to get evacuation of medical attention to the victim.","To prevent this issue from happening again, we need to scrap the Vertex, or at least boost the power (if possible) to an acceptable level. At this point the old Bendix Kings were 10 times stronger both on transmit and receive, and there were very few communication black out areas on the district. Now those black out areas are larger, and much more numerous. With communications so important in the 10, 18, and LCES, and Safety always being priority number one, it seems silly to be using inferior quality radios when safer, more effective radios exist.

At least once the team arrived they gave each division a national tactical channel which had already been programmed into our mobile Vertex. Since we now believed that we had solid communications using our mobile we were no longer attached to another engine. We were used as a lookout by an IHC crew while they cold trailed a long piece of line that they could not see all of.

At first communication was fine as the fire was still relatively small. As the fire progressed and increased in size we started losing communication with the other resources on the incident. Our Vertex handhelds just didn’t seem to have enough power to communicate on a simplex channel at any distance.

There was a Type 3 team assigned .  

I arrived on scene during Mop-up as a Div. Supervisor (A) on the opposite side of the fire from where the event occurred. I took note of a pattern of dozer lines on a steep hillside that caused me to question what had occurred in earlier operations.

I had been informed at briefing that unexpected winds (about 25-30 mph) had fanned the N. edge of the fire when they thought they had 'buttoned-it-up'. One IHC Supt. described it as 'chaos' as the fire raced N. down the slope toward the edge of the community of Contact.

On our last day 7/19 I offered up assistance to the 'team' with contract equipment inspections (my trainee needed this experience) and it turned out no pre-inspections had been conducted. It was at this time that I took the opportunity to ask the dozer operator about those steep dead-end dozer lines on the hillside. This was a first-year operator. He told me '...it was really exciting out there but kind of scary cause he couldn't talk to or hear anyone.' He told me that his dozer had stalled on the hillside and the fire was coming at him. He got out and ran to the nearby rock outcrop until the fire passed over his dozer. The fuel-type in this area was grass and sagebrush. After the fire passed he made it back to his dozer and it started up ok.

I then talked to the other seasoned dozer operator. He told me that when they tried to get a radio at BIFC/NIFC; they told him they would get one on the incident & that this was common practice.

I then decided to go to the I.C. I asked him what their policy is w/ regard to dozers and radio communications. He told me that he usually carries extra radios but he didn't have one. He said that they 'mitigate this situation by assigning another tactical resource to the dozer' and in this case it was an engine crew. I offered that in our region a contract dozer cannot go on line with out a dozer boss directly assigned. He said that a dozer boss is ideal but repeated that assigning another tactical resource is mitigating the situation.

At the end of our last day, my assigned trainee called for an after-shift AAR. The I.C. asked for input to 'take forth' and up the line. I gave the last comment. I mentioned that they need to make a change in their policy with regard to use of contract dozers without adequate radio communications or dozer bosses. One of the other remaining resources gave a supporting comment of agreement stating it is a major safety violation'.

2. Know what your fire is doing at all times.

7. Maintain prompt communications with your forces, your supervisor and adjoining forces.

9. Maintain control of your forces at all times.

During this time frame we encountered many problems with our current radios. Here in Region 6 we decided to save some money two years ago by buying radios that were cheaper to purchase than King radios. Vertex radios were the radios that were purchased by some forests and these forests are using them exclusively. When we first received our Vertex’s, there had been a lot of problems and grumbling about how bad these radios were. Most problems I heard people talk about were how there were too many features, and it did not work as well as the King radios. Here at our district I know everyone was opposed to them from the start. We in Fire tried very hard not to judge the Vertex before we had a chance to use them, and after getting used to most of the features found that the radio performs ok for our home district users. The problems we had in Arizona are problems that all of us with Vertex radios will have when leaving our home districts. Tone controlled repeaters are used in many parts of the country and the Tonto N.F. is one of those places. We arrived in Globe and our first task had been to figure out communications, we spent many hours programming all of there frequencies in to our radios, we found that we were unable to use our radios with tone controlled repeaters. We attempted to fix this problem during the whole 14 day assignment, but we were rarely ever able to communicate with any one using the Vertex. The Ranger District had one extra King they were able to lend us but this did not fix the problem at all. We responded to three dispatches during this time and most of our communications with the dispatch center had been by cell phone, and the only radio communication had been with the borrowed King. Another concern I have with our current radio situation is the nonprogrammable radios we have in our vehicles. On our home district there are many areas that we can not hit repeaters with our handhelds and the extra power in the vehicle radio is the only way to communicate with others.","The obvious answer to this is for all employees to have King Radios again; I know that this is not impossible, with the dangers all forest workers deal with these days, and the fact that we know how important communications are, we have to buy a radio that will work in all areas. Another possible answer is to have King Radios at each district for those individuals who have to go off forest. Type 1 crews are allowed to purchase and have Kings for their travels during the summer, and this shows that these problems have already been noticed, and it is time for us to realize that not having communications is a very dangerous situation and is one of our 10 Standard Firefighting Orders that we all are responsible for following.

At approximately 1117, our Air Attack aircraft went up for a recon. At 1134 a high pitch tone came across our radio. We tried to contact the Radio Shop to see if they could get a hold of the QWEST tech and have them stop the tone. The QWEST tech was running tests on the circuits here in town and had gotten onto the wrong one causing the piercing tone over the radios.

Air Attack reported that they started to receive the high pitch tone on Air Guard about 5 miles out of Lewistown. This caused them to have to shut their radios down.

Several weeks ago the Forest Service had some problems with the Laramie Peak repeater.

There is communication with the Forest Service through the BLM repeater but this communication ties up the BLM base station which is used by resource staff and for initial attack by the BLM.

July 11, 2005

Incident Name and Number: Chapman Fire (BS4V)

Incident Type, Activity and Stage: Wildfire, Support, Demob.

Location: Fort Wainwright, Alaska 1544 Gaffney Rd. AFS Warehouse

Contributing Factors: Human Factors and misuse of equipment.

On Monday, the 11th of July, the AFS warehouse received backhaul from the Chapman Fire. The backhaul included a Fedco (NFES 1149…pump, backpack) that contained approximately 1 gallon of liquid that turned out to be drip torch mix fuel. Fedco’s routinely come with liquid in them and are emptied at the beginning of the refurbishment process. In this case a warehouse employee opened the Fedco to drain and got drip torch fuel on their hands and it also resulted in a small fuel spill.

Issue:

Backpack pumps are for dispensing of water only; this was an inappropriate use of that equipment that could have resulted in injury/exposure to personnel, is a serious violation of transportation of fuel and a possible fire hazard.","We need to continually educate the firefighter/incidents that the shipping and packaging of fuel from the field to the Caches is a serious matter.    Corrective Actions:

1) An inquiry into the source of this misuse of equipment.

2) The filing of this SAFENET.

3) A meeting with fire managers to dispense information to the field personnel throughout Alaska that fuel should never be used in backpack pumps.

4) An e-mail of the above information being disseminated throughout the BLM and State of Alaska Networks.

5) A review of spill response procedures at the AFS warehouse.

The final link in our radio system is a hard-line link from BAM to Winnemucca. Over the 6-plus years that the current dispatch scenario has been in place, this link has failed numerous times, leaving the 11 million acre BMFO without radio coverage for extended periods.

When this has failed in the past, the back-up has been to cut the switch to Winnemucca, and activate the old BAM dispatch.

On 7/10/05, there was a temporary disruption in this land-line connection. However, Nevada Bell believed they had it repaired that evening. On 7/11, the problem re-surfaced, on an intermittent basis. Upon the decision to 'throw the switch' and activate BAM Dispatch, management was informed that BAM dispatch was non-functional. The problem lies in the console not being narrow-banded. The BMFO communications tech informed me that for the last year, the technician from NSO has been unavailable to travel to Battle Mountain to convert the equipment.

As a result, BMFO has no back-up to an unreliable communications system in the middle of fire season.","Provide service to BAM Dispatch to made system narrow-band capable.

The fires then progressed beyond the type 5 IC's limit and type 4 IC's and additional resources were ordered. All three fires were progressing at about the same speed and at the same time. Once I received my briefing and transitioned into the incident as the commander I started using my radio to contact the forces on the incident to confirm that a transition had taken place, what the new tactics were, and what the new tactical frequency would be. Every person was able to program their Vertex radios with the new tactical channel and communication was established throughout the fire. Then the problems started. The other two incidents progressed to the same type 4 incident at this time and the command frequency we were using (the only one that could be reached) became extremely cluttered. The Vertex radios we have give the user 5 seconds to key the mike and the radio will automatically transmit on whichever frequency was received in the last 5 seconds.

The IC requested that the switch be made after the operational shift. He was told by CCIFC that he was going to switch NOW because the Air to Ground frequency assigned to the fire was also the local flight following frequency, and was interfering with that operation. CCIFC said that NICC assigned the incident A/G frequency through EGBCC and that we needed to take the issue up with them.

During this time there was a large burnout operation in progress on Division A with many resources involved. We had no problems resulting from this SNAFU, but with a large firing operation underway and being in the middle of an operational shift on a large (30,000+ acre) fire with approximately 300 people assigned, it could have been very easy for some resources to miss this frequency switch, or not receive it in a timely manner.

If a serious incident would have occurred in which air resources would have tried to contact ground resources or vice-versa, there could have been serious delays, resulting in an untoward outcome.

* A similar situation occurred with CCIFC and the same Type 3 team on Friday, June 24, 2005, on the Westside Complex Fire.

Does EGBCC have a list of the local flight following frequencies for the dispatch centers in the Eastern Great Basin?

I think that the answers to the above would provide the corrective action.

Using these three layers of redundant checks would be a good way to minimize the possibility of this happening again.    The IC told dispatch that we'd switch after the operational period.

Last summer while serving as an SOF2 on the Three Fire Complex in Arizona I became concerned about some radio traffic between a Task Force Leader and one of his crews. The traffic from the TFLD was clear but the other half of the traffic came across as totally unreadable squelch. However, it was obvious that the TFLD was able to understand the traffic from the crew even though none of the rest of us monitoring the conversation could. I recognized the “squelch” sound as the sound heard when someone is transmitting in digital mode and the receiving radio is receiving in analog mode. Our local BLM has been converting to digital gradually over the past several years and it is common for their personnel to accidentally transmit in digital mode. Since all of their radios are programmed to receive in mixed mode they don’t even realize the problem. However since many of our radios are still analog we pick up only the “squelch” sound.

Suspecting that this was the problem I tracked down the TFLD and asked him how he was hearing the crew transmissions. He stated he could understand them on his portable but not his mobile. We quickly discovered his portable was one of the new digital BK radios and was programmed to receive in mixed mode. The mobile was an older model analog. I then tracked down the crew. The crew boss trainee explained that when he programmed all their digital hand held BK radios with the tactical frequency he had come to the Mode option and changed it to “D” (digital). Since he programmed all their radios the same and then did a radio check he did not realize his error. Although he knew how to program in the new frequencies he had no idea what the Mode option was for.

At the end of shift I explained the issue to the Communications Unit Leader. He was not familiar with the new digital BK radios and their additional options. He did however state that he had been able to clone new frequencies into the digitals with a GPH series radio. Of course cloning with a GPH would not affect the Mode.

I believe we have the potential to have a serious problem. First, anyone who currently knows how to field program a BK radio can easily change the receive or transmit mode to digital or mixed simply by pushing the priority button when given the “Mode” option. Secondly if someone arrives at an incident with a radio from home that is programmed to transmit in the digital mode and they have it cloned it will continue to transmit in the digital mode. Either way no one on the incident with an analog radio or a digital radio set for analog receive, will be able to understand the transmissions.

At the very least I hope we can get this information distributed widely so we can correct the problems quickly when they occur.","Ensure all Comm Techs and Comm Unit Leaders are aware of this potential problem. Distribute information widely so crews know that they must keep their radios in the correct mode. The problem is actually fairly easy to recognize as soon as you hear the radio transmit, as long as someone recognizes the 'squelch' sound made by a radio transmitting in the wrong mode.    I hope that wide spread distribution of this information will prevent or correct this problem immediately when it occurs.","02/06/2006 00:00"

Make crews aware of the light flashy fuels in the southwest, and the potential for erratic fire behavior due to winds and terrain.    An After Action Review was conducted with the involved parties. It was determined that good training and the setting of trigger points assisted the crewmembers on the helispot to make timely decision and allowed them to safely use their escape routes. This is an example of how crews should behave when put into situations where conditions are potentially hazardous. Observe, Establish Trigger Points, Execute LCES in a timely manner. Despite the loss of some gear the crew is safe and this SAFENET is just another notice that conditions are extreme in the light flashy fuels of the Southwest. Crews should not underestimate the potential for erratic fire behavior and should have proper LCES in place.","06/28/2005 00:00"

Crew members facing forward were only held on by their seat belt during the rapid nose dives. I was not aware of this until the next day (24th).

On 6/24/05 while doing a crew transport the pilot decided again to mess around, flying out of path from the point to point mission and to climb steadily and do rapid declines, then flying side to side and messing around. The pilot continued to do this for the entire troop shuttle.

This is uncalled for behavior by a pilot and something should be done. The temperatures were in the low 100's. It was very unprofessional, aggressive and irrational behavior to fly as 'cowboy' as he did.

The boom delimber was on a hillside at a log landing and was on fire. There was no one around the equipment. The FS employee called Northern Great Plains Dispatch to notify them of the fire. Great Plains was notified of the type of fire, and local Forest Service engine crews were dispatched to the fire. In the meantime the equipment operator had driven approximately 4-5 miles to find a phone to call in the fire. The 911 call was received by Custer County dispatch and fire department personnel with equipment were dispatched to the scene. In an interview with county dispatch, and reviewing the radio tape, it was determined that Great Plains dispatch failed to notify the county dispatch of the fire, which resulted in inappropriate resources initially being dispatched to the equipment fire. Once Custer County dispatch received the 911 call, Great Plains dispatch was notified of the fire.

Upon arriving at the fire, the equipment was fully engulfed in flames. The 80 gallon hydraulic oil tank had gotten so hot that the oil was boiling. I feel if the equipment operator had not went for assistance, the FS engine crews would have been in harms way if the tank would have ruptured causing a rapid release of burning oil throughout the general area. The engine crews were very responsive to the fire departments needs and directions. There is an understanding of the hazards and the potential with this type of fire with the FS engine crews. The failure by the dispatcher at Great Plains to notify the appropriate resources exposed FS engine crews initially, and may have led to the additional damage to the equipment and increased danger to all firefighters on the incident.","1. Communication between Great Plains dispatch and county dispatch centers must be improved. They must be be receptive to comments, concerns, and constructive criticism.

2. If the type of fire is identified, appropriate resources and agencies must be notified and dispatched in a timely manner. As an example - if someone calls in a structure fire, FS engine crews should not be the initial resources dispatched. Fire Departments should be the first dispatched units and then followed up with wildland engines.

3. Dispatch centers must understand their role in this type of incident. They are the first line of response, and their actions primarily are an INFORMATION DISSEMINATION AGENCY. Their role is to receive information and disperse the information to the appropriate agency or agencies.

4. Dispatchers must receive adequate training on types of fires, as well as their roles in fires other than wildfires, and how resources are used for a particular incident.

5. A mechanism must be established for all agencies that use Great Plains and the process to be heard, a way for resolution of concerns and or safety issues, and all agencies must know how to access this process.    I tried to discuss this with the Dispatch center director  with no resolution. I was told that Custer County is the problem and the dispatch center is NOT an information dissemination center.

Secondly I discussed this with the BHNF FMO and expressed my concern. He stated he would discuss it the the center director.

There must be clear cut direction for dispatchers to use in this type of incident. Further, counties and Great Plains must come to an understanding of their roles and how to improve communication. Counties are required to notify Great Plains dispatch of reported fires. However Great Plains will only notify counties when they have time to do so, and on other occasions local agencies have not been notified.

Set radio frequencies between all agencies must be used for all incidents involving multi agencies.","07/07/2005 00:00"

LCC was unable to receive our transmission on all repeaters. We were able to receive LCC and we were able to transmit and receive to the field. I requested that LCC adjust their volume controls. LCC said they could see the receiving indicator on the radio monitor but could not hear us or anyone in the field.

I called the End User Support Center (EUSC) at 1805 on 06/15. I explained the problem and was given a ticket number (#1601604). I explained to them this was a high level emergency and a high priority.

We waited approximately 1/2 hour for EUSC to call us back then started leaving messages with our local Radio Manager. Unable to reach our local Radio Manager we called a local radio tech at home. Our local radio tech asked that we have LCC ask their radio tech to come in a look at the problem. Our local radio tech said he would come to the office to see what he could do.

At 1900 I called LCC to discuss their availability of a radio tech and to do another radio check. At that time all channels received and transmitted properly.

I contacted our local radio tech to disregard and called EUSC to tell them to lower the priority but to leave the ticket open as we were not sure if the problem was resolved.

The MOST CRITICAL one from my perspective as a dispatcher is that, in dispatch, we are not able to access any repeater consistently. This is, of course, a major SAFETY issue for us and people in the field, to say nothing of being a major irritation. For example when I came to work 6/11, I tried hitting each repeater and these are the results. I made several tries each.

Chev Butte				Gentry

Greens-Sitgreaves			Promontory

Rose Peak				Big Lake

Escudilla				Saddle Mtn.

South Mtn.				Bear

Mitchell Peak

And all this will change in 10 seconds and/or 5 minutes and/or this afternoon. The NOs may become YESs and the YESs may become NOs. You never know. We have 'tickets” in for these radio problems and other radio problems. My earliest ticket that was about not being able to access a repeater consistently was dated 6/3/2005. On 6/11, ignition started on the Mesa RX (planned) burn on Clifton District. We knew we may not be able to talk to it, so there was a human repeater at the district office. Another dispatcher had to read a SPOT forecast several times to the Mesa RX off Mitchell Peak repeater before she could get a squelch tail. So what happens if/when we get a fire/accident and we are unable to talk to it at a CRITICAL time/ didn't know we needed a human repeater somewhere in advance??

When is this CRITICAL enough to actually get the radio system fixed?

(2) Several times during the last 2 weeks, we have been reading the weather (simul-select/ Greens Peak) and hear our voice coming back over on Flight Following/ once we could hear a Tonto NF dispatchers voice/reading the weather bleeding over on Flight Following along with mine.

(3) On 6/12 H-306 had been flight-following with Flagstaff Zone and called us about 1230 when they were about 5 miles out of from here, Springerville. Later the manager told we were very weak/could hardly understand us but Flagstaff Zone was still coming in loud and clear over flight- following in the helicopter radio. A Flagstaff dispatcher called us to say we were coming in over their flight-following weak and unclear. We always hear Flag Zone or Tucson loud and clear over flight-following.

(4) Yesterday we had the recon plane, 39Q, up. Several times the AA would say something to dispatch. The aircraft dispatcher would reply (off Apache-Greens or Sitgreaves-Greens) and the AA would say 'dispatch did you copy?' She would reply 'copy 39Q' Again 'dispatch did you copy?' Eventually she could actually transmit and he would hear her.

(5) Blah blah blah","FIX THE RADIO/MICROWAVE SYSTEM - GET SOMEONE WHO CAN

Possibly, if other forests are looking to get their radio/microwave systems replaced, they might, at least, want to wait until all the parts/software are there before they begin installation. Of course (?)

they might want to see how/when/if this works out on the Apache- Sitgreaves NF (and on the Santa Fe NF I guess) before they contract for something. Also why pay for something until it's completed. Why would a contractor come back??    We in dispatch can and do REPEAT THINGS OVER AND OVER AND OVER, like the weather, like 'copy', like 'yes, dispatch copies' until we get a squelch tail.

We can and do keep lookouts up, arrange for other human repeaters.

We (others in Dispatch as well as myself) have filed tickets, talked repeatedly to the Comm Spec here, talked repeatedly to the NICS people/ contractors who installed PART of the new microwave/radio system a few weeks ago (we were told they would install some software next FALL!!!), and reported all this to fire/field personnel and fire supervisors.

Basically there is nothing dispatchers can do to fix the radio system except CONTINUE TO FILE TICKETS AND SAFENETS and let everyone know what is going on so we all can function safely at some level. I am going to do a repeater check every morning and will file a new SAFENET as needed. This morning when I checked, I could hit 3 repeaters 'all' the time, 4 about 50% of the time, and 6 not at all.

Problems:

1. While I was in scan mode, I was trying to communicate on our incident tactical frequency; several times I accidentally transmitted over forest repeaters. I believe this is due to other incident radio traffic in our area combined with our automatic call back scan feature programmed into our radios. The major problem that occurred was that I took my radio out of scan feature because the five second automatic callback after a transmission and therefore the forest dispatch was unable to reach me. This also caused a problem when I was in contact with dispatch and not using the scan function, people on the incident using the tactical frequency were then unable to reach me.

2. Transmitting with other Vertex radios within 20 foot proximity caused all radios to squelch and no transmission sent.","1. Reprogram radios so they do not automatically call back the last scanned frequency picked up. Also, instead of the radio screen displaying SCAN, it should read the channel that it is set to.

2. I do not know why this happens and do not know of any preventative measures.    1. Have a second person in close proximity scanning other channels or carry two radios.

The vehicle has a 5 speed manual transmission. The vehicle was parked on a very slight incline of 2% to 4% grade left in reverse gear and the E-brake applied. The vehicle was un-chocked at the time the incident occurred. After being parked for approximately thirty to forty five minutes, the vehicle unexpectedly rolled backwards for about fifty feet and crashed into the other crew truck. Upon inspection of the vehicle immediately following the accident it was confirmed that the truck was in fact in reverse gear and the E-brake applied. The truck gave a repeat performance later during a crew shuttle operation. The truck was being driven by a crew member from another agency who was not aware of this potential problem. He too applied the E-brake and left the rig in first gear. This time the vehicle rolled forward right after the driver got out of the vehicle, and was stopped by a crewmember who was being shuttled. This occurred on a much steeper slope of about 20%. Again it was noted that the truck was in gear and the E-brake applied.","When the accident first happened it was quite a surprise due to how slight the incline was, only about 2%. We did however conduct a safety meeting on chocking vehicles at all times. It is currently being noted that every now and then when we remove the chock block, there are times when the truck has rolled up tight against the block and has to be backed up before the block can be removed.

I am a supervisor for the Grants Pass Resource Area Fire and Fuels shop (Medford, Oregon BLM). I assisted during prescribed fire activities last weekend. I personally witnessed several problems with our communication system.

Unless there is a direct line of sight, crew channels will not transmit and receive beyond distances of 1/2 mile. Our group has reported not being able to communicate when working on the same unit that is separated by a sub-ridge. They have used communication relays on units that are 20 acres.

Using the repeaters worked some of the time. There seems to be several dead spots and the clarity is scratchy making clear communication problematic.

If communication needs to be established with Medford Dispatch, personnel walk down to the mobile vehicle radio to transmit information.

Using a handheld, I was not able to pick up the afternoon weather forecast. I heard the forecast on the Engine mobile radio. I checked to see if I was scanning and whether my handheld channel was programmed - it was - but I couldn't pick anything up.

During this time, we had a serious accident on another unit. The Burn Boss was not able to communicate with Dispatch on his handheld. The Burn Boss had to utilize the contractor’s communication system and his work cell phone to mobilize the medical evacuation.","Something needs to be done at the Regional level.

When the helitack crew arrived via air, there was an ICT5 qualified individual managing the progressively complex incident. The size of the fire upon arrival was 50+ acres with all flanks active, and 15 - 20 foot flames. The IC requested the helitack crew to try and hold the fire on the north side of a dirt road and try and catch the spot fire which it had recently crossed. At about this time air attack arrived on scene and started working 2 Seats along the head of the fire. About 45 minutes into the fire (size about 250 acres+) air attack notified the IC that there was a house immediately threatened just upwind of the fire about 1/4 mile away with 12 people and 2 dogs and that they were in immediate danger and were in need of immediate evacuation. A BLM LEO came over the tactical frequency and notified the IC that he was with the ranchers at the house and was unsure what to do next. At this time, the IC contacted the helitack supervisor and asked her what her qualifications were. She told him ICT4 and STCR. He requested that she take over the incident because it had rapidly progressed beyond his ability to manage the incident safely. She accepted and made the announcement over the radio and it was at this time that the RACAL brand radio completely and altogether quit receiving transmissions. The battery was still completely fresh, and there was no apparent reason for the failure. The transitioning incident commander with an immediate life safety issue had to take one of the Bendix King Radios (which continued working perfectly) from another firefighter - leaving him without one - to continue managing the fire safely. The individuals were safely led out of harm's way, a type 3 IC was ordered and eventually a type 2 team was ordered. The fire burned 6400 acres and had threatened a subdivision, by the time it was over. At such a critical time in this incident this most important item to fire fighter safety failed and could have contributed to private citizens being injured or worse. The radio still does not receive transmissions and it is uncertain as to the reason why. I feel this equipment is substandard to the needs of firefighters and should be discontinued due to the potential with regards to safety. As a new employee to the BLM (recently transferred from another agency) I've been told that the RACAL is the ONLY approved radio along with some EF Johnson type device and that the Bendix King is no longer approved with this particular agency.

In the interim, the district will need to carefully monitor the functional performance of their system. Any time it is not working, they should consider the use of human relays (using mobile/hand-helds) in place of the repeater. Cell phones may also provide emergency contact capability.

One of the stands and the drill was proctored by a HIGHLY RESPECTED former IHC Superintendent who now works for a local county fire agency. This particular stand was the fire shelter deployment drill. At this training drill there were old and new generation fire shelters and practice shelters of both varieties utilized. There were several issues and concerns that surfaced with deployment of the new generation fire shelters.

Upon deployment of the new generation fire shelters multiple shelters had handles fail by coming unstitched. These were not the earlier recalled shelters. When these failed the side of the shelter that failed flew away from the people deploying. It was also apparent that the real shelters require much more vigorous shaking to come unfolded. There was one individual, who is above average physical stature, that took about 10 seconds more than the rest of his module to deploy. The increased deployment time was directly attributed to the shelter being extremely compressed and of such heavier weight. The new generation practice shelter was extremely easy to deploy and did not give a realistic training experience when compared to the issues with the real new generation shelter. Upon witnessing this it became apparent that in the heat of the moment a person knowing it required more physical exertion to deploy could actually shake this thing so hard the handles would come off and the shelter would fly off into the wind. Turbulent winds would compound the issue.

Another glaring factor was the reduced airspace of the new generation fire shelter. Upon reviewing all the material with the new shelter, it still only reflects 95% of the heat. This was the previously published number for the old generation fire shelter. So what we actually have is a fire shelter with less airspace that still reflects and absorbs the same amount of heat. The issue here is the shelter, with little to no wind, would sag directly touching the occupant. This would cause heat to be directly transferred to the flesh on a large percentage of the persons back. Would a person be able to stand that long enough to stay in the shelter? I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IT!!! Again, I said little to no wind for the sag.... not turbulent convective winds.","The new generation fire shelter, while offering the double layering of material, is still seriously lacking structural integrity. The new fire shelter needs to be re-designed with a ridge or some other structural integrity place on top to keep the shelter from sagging onto the occupant. The floor in the shelter does not do you any good if the shelter is covering half your back transferring heat directly to your flesh.

The handle systems on the shelters are not adequate. The handles need to be addressed and re-designed.

Analyze and re-design the shelters so they deploy or come unfolded easier.    First and foremost modules will/must train with real new generation fire shelters. You cannot train the problems using the 'practice' shelter, which do not simulate the problems with the new generation fire shelters. When training to correct problems you must set the problem up in order to teach someone how to overcome it. The problems with the new generation fire shelters, which could prove to be fatal, will not be corrected locally. Specifically the design flaws of the new generation fire shelters must be overcome by engineers. The modules that utilize the new generation fire shelter will overcome these problems by training and simulating these problems.

The question one must ask is if time is of the essence can you overcome 10-20 seconds of delay during a deployment? What it the fire shelter comes out of your hands and flies away with the wind? One of the module leaders commented that the best fire shelter is between a person’s ears, and I could not agree more. Increase situational awareness, a thorough hazard assessment, more than adequate hazard control and good sound decision making had better be in play.","05/25/2005 00:00"

This is the first season of elimination of the 4th tier Saguache Initial Attack Dispatch and total reliance on PIDC for all fire dispatch. Communications via radio system, primarily the Boot Mt. repeater were satisfactory. All proceeded adequately through the weekend and until Tuesday May 17. The radio link from the Rx fire over Boot Mt into PIDC experienced problems. Sat phone & Saguache office relay was utilized for this period of difficulty. On Wed May 18 radio systems appeared partially operational except Boot Mt and RG Direct. Basically, communication with PIDC was reduced to satellite phone and brief periods of radio commo from Boot Mt &/or RG Direct. However, commo was mostly good to the Saguache office. Therefore, Saguache VIS personnel and finally a skilled dispatcher relayed fire info & needs to PIDC on phone lines because radio was not able to provide a reliable link. During this time, the Prescribed Fire became resistant to control due to wind gusts and spotting across control lines occurred. Additional resources were ordered thru the link at Saguache. Evening approached and the minor spotting was evaluated to be well within the MMA, contained at apprx 5-7 acres and all remained within prescription. However, other resources considered for approx an hour or so were AVAILABILITY of a Type 3 helicopter with module and bucket should the need be there. This was later miscommunicated to be considered ORDERED. Upon mutual understanding this was determined not to be necessary and cancelled. Meals were ordered due to keeping personnel on the line later than planned to manage the spots. A RADO was requested from PIDC to be at Saguache for the Thurs May 19 operational period to talk to fire personnel and relay to PIDC. PIDC provided this support. Radio communication was good to the Saguache office, but not working from the RX fire to PIDC. EUSC was contacted on Wed May 18 by both PIDC & the RGF and ticket(s) were issued. A Comm-Tech worked on repairs on Thurs May 19 & Fri May 20 and continues repairs May 24, 25 and ongoing. By late PM Friday May 20 it appeared that Boot MT repeater was working from the Rx fire into PIDC (and Saguache) but RG Direct was not working and the Comm-Tech will continue to work on the system. A transmit time delay issue remains when PIDC uses the Boot Mt repeater that has been temporally resolved with PIDC dispatchers using a 1,2,3,4,5 count upon keying the mic before beginning the message.

PIDC did a Resource Order for a RADO to be at the old Saguache Dispatch office for Friday May 20 that would enable them to have their RADO/ Dispatcher return to Pueblo for scheduled days off. With radio commo re-established from the RX burn to PIDC, it was planned to keep the old Saguache Dispatch office staffed and available for 2 operational periods to assure adequate communication has been re-established. Therefore, Saguache Dispatch did remain staffed by a PIDC Resource Ordered RADO for Sat May 21 & Sunday May 22. An evaluation was made Sunday evening to see if this could be terminated. All dispatch service was returned to PIDC for Monday May 23 thru current time.

Evaluation provided by Zone Comm-Tech's indicates that the obsolete radio system on the RGF is subject to a high rate of failure. Outdated microwave links that control base radios that then enable commo to reach PIDC need to be replaced immediately. These microwave links are suggested to be no longer authorized. The microwave is not to be utilized and the FCC will eventually sell these frequencies that are currently still being used.

In summary, PIDC & the RGF maintain excellent working relationships, EUSC appears to have been responsive, additional costs incurred seem related to system / equipment failures and I fully anticipate the complex 'links' that enable PIDC to utilize RGF radio systems will remain problematic. The RGF does not intend to re-establish the 4th tier Saguache Dispatch. I view this temporary use of the old Saguache Dispatch office as merely an extension of PIDC activated to assure firefighter safety is not compromised.","First: Evaluate the entire radio system on the RGF that also serves the San Luis Valley BLM. Evaluate the link(s) that enable PIDC to use the RGF radio system.

Second- or at same time: Immediately replace outdated microwave links that currently enable base radios to operate (Del Norte Office to Aqua Ramon & Saguache Office to Saguache Peak) and also eliminate the complex network of links involving Colorado State controlled lines, Quest phone lines, and perhaps other hardware/software and move our commo to the established Network that currently is in place and carries our other data needs, i.e. computers. Also provide a reliable link for Flight Following Radio and Air to Ground Radio that are currently on Aqua Ramon. Comm-Tech suggested solution is Spread Spectrum link to control these 3 radios on Aqua Ramon and a VHF/UHF link to control the radio on Saguache Peak.

Eventually: Consider placement of a zone Comm-Tech on the RGF which is more centrally located within the Southwest Zone working circle. This placement would enable the Comm-Tech to provide more timely service to the RGF (that currently may have the most 'at-risk' radio system in the zone) as well as the eastern portion of the San Juan NF and the western edge of the San Isabel NF.    EUSC was contacted and Tickets were issued. Satellite Phone(s) were utilized during times of difficult radio commo & RADO was utilized.

Suggestions on how this can be prevented in the future are given above with radio system modifications.","05/25/2005 00:00"

To facilitate communications with state resources (and to be able to implement the contingency plan if needed) we were operating on DNR frequencies which are wide band analog. (State and local resources do not have narrow band nor digital capabilities). The communications plan for the burn was shared with the NPS personnel prior to ignition.

During the pre burn briefing the communications check had gone well. However about 30 minutes into the burn it was apparent that we did not have adequate communications with all personnel.

DNR radios were King EPH models. FWS radios were Motorola XTS 3000 and Racal. NPS radios were King DPH. DNR policy prohibits field programming or cloning of radios except on out of state fire assignments. Neither of the FWS radios on scene could clone to King radios. This required the NPS radios to be hand programmed.","The inability to provide a common radio on an incident requires hand programming. With all of the information that needs to be programmed into a radio (Frequency, analog/digital, narrow/wide band, tone guards, transmit power, misplaced decimal point etc.) it is easy to have a key piece of information get programmed incorrectly.

Having a common radio at least for all federal wildland fire agencies would allow us to clone to each others radios.

Review station/burn plan and zone communications plans to assure they list which frequencies are wide band/narrow band and digital/analog.    After reviewing radio settings we determined that several of the radios had certain settings that would not allow them to operate with the local FWS and DNR radios.

The shelter was then folded back on to original folds and placed back into the original plastic cover and case and flagged so as not to be put into service.

My squad was mopping up smokes as we went up hill following the basic edge of the slop over. Our squad boss had gone to check out a smoke down a hill side while the rest of the squad climbed closer to the top of the slop over, a few minutes later he yelled to us to get over there as quickly as we could. I was the first one to arrive and I began scratch lining the edge of the flames as they crept uphill as a slow pace. The fuel type of was light to moderate height grass with random black brush and sage. The squad boss was on the other side of the spot fire which was around 100 feet wide at that point. I decided that since the fire was moving very slowly I would run a ways up hill and make a quick scratch line. Another individual yelled something to me as I went uphill but in the confusion I didn’t understand what he had said. I was putting in my scratch line when the wind shifted blowing the fire up at me. The wind was blowing about 10-15 mph. I knew I had made a mistake and I grabbed a new guy and took him to get in the black. We both ran through the flames and into the black. Neither of us were injured. The flames we around 3-6 ft. tall and about 6 ft wide.

Afterwards we were told to anchor in and dig line. (This is the part that kills me 'afterwards')

VFD was actively fighting fire along with a 'crew' from whitestone logging camp at head of fire. Size was 3-5 acres and wind driven and rate of spread was about 12-15 chains per hour. Flame length 6-12 feet depending upon fuels.

1322...Fire pushed by winds. Short range spotting and more trees torching. VFD called for emergency egress, three VFD members narrowly escaped, 1300-1500 feet of hose burned. VFD crew divided by fire, half on west side of mill road and other half on east side of mill road. No injuries. Fire individual calls for spot weather forcast.

1340...A member of management arrives on scene. I attempted to brief this individual, I was interupted by him stating 'this is to big for you to handle, I'm in charge here until a new IC arrives.' I am a qualified IC5 and the only one on the district at the time of the fire. This individual showed up wearing blue jeans and a nomex shirt, a hard hat and boots. No other PPE was worn. He also admitted on the scene that he 'was not red carded but was on the fire as his day job role.'

1345...This individual proceded to head of fire to talk with IC of VFD.

1352...This individual calls for HRD fire squad to 'gear up and get ready to engage.

1400...Fire Module drove to head of fire. Parking about 1/3 mile away from active front, which was currently jumping the mill road. Numerous trucks closer to fire front blocking egress of the road with the member of management's farthest in (closest to the fire). The member of management ordered fire squad (consisting of three people) to engage by cutting fuel break and digging line through the muskeg by starting in the middle of the fire, anchoring to the mill road and flanking the fire and direct as possible. Fire Module did not engage at this time due to waiting for chapps to arrive that were forgotten on the back of the pick-up truck.

1415...Fire has now jumped mill road and was still being pushed by the wind. The member of management went into the muskeg to 'walk the fire.' We were told to be ready to engage upon his return. We were again told to engage. This was questioned by numerous people at this time, including district safety officer. The member of management kept telling everyone 'to calm down, it's only a little smoke. Take a deep breath and calm down.' At this time the fire was aprox. 75-100 acres and still being wind driven.

From here on out, my time line is aproximate.

Aprox. 1445-1500

Radio call was received that crew members from Juneau were to arrive shortly. The member of management ordered one member of the Fire Module to take only escape vehicle to pick up individuals at airport while leaving squad boss and one crew member on mill road to 'monitor fire behavior.' This point was disputed by squad boss and against the member of management's wishes, pulled back at staged at point of origin.

2...All ten Fire Oders and at least 8 of the watch out situations were violated, along with each of the LCES, by this individual during IA.

3...On numerous occasions the ICS system was blatently ignored by both of these management individuals, even to the point of arguing with the IC and Helicopters during an evacuation of a farm.

On Friday, April 29, 2005 at 1200 hours, the Muskeg Fire was started by debris from a burning trash pile. After a significant wind driven advance of the flame front, initial suppression efforts by the local VFD and a local logging crew were unsuccessful. The VFD incident commander immediately called for aid from the Forest Service. The Fire Module assembled and as per local protocol, awaited a dispatch from a member of management. District personnel could not locate this individual for approximately 1.5 hours. During this time weather was taken at the origin of the fire using a handheld electronic weather meter (kestrel).

Weather observations:

1300 - 67 degrees F, 11% RH, Winds = NE @ 8-15 mph with gusts to 28mph

1330 - 68 degrees F, 13% RH, Winds = NE @ 11 mph with strong gusts

1430 - 68 degrees F, 16% RH, Winds = NE @ 7-11 mph with strong gusts

1815 - 61 degrees F, 15% RH, Winds = NE @ 5-7 mph with gusts

Upon arrival at the incident the member of management, who had neither a valid 'red card' nor proper Personal Protective Equipment (no nomex pants, no gloves, no fire shelter, and no bear rifle) stated that he was 'here as (his district role) and not as a firefighter' and that he was 'in charge until an IC arrives'. He then proceeded to the head of the fire to discuss strategy with the VFD chief. After discussion with VFD chief, the member of management made a radio call to fire module member and informed him that he needed to get the module 'geared up' and meet him at the head of the fire. The fire module member then drove to the designated location, parked the truck in a way that would allow for a quick egress and he and two firefighters walked down the road to meet the member of management.

With no briefing at all, no lookout in place, no ability to see the fire, no mention of safety zones and escape routes, and no anchor point, the member of management assigned the module (3 firefighters) to construct hand line and endeavor to 'hook the head of the fire'. At this time flame lengths were 15-20' with spotting, crowning, and torching and the fire had already jumped a road. The FFT1 stated that he could not engage the fire immediately as he had forgotten his saw chaps and was awaiting their arrival.

The engagement plan presented by the member of management was immediately questioned by a safety officer. An argument ensued between the member of management and the safety officer about the validity ('stupidity') of the proposed tactics.

The member of management then proceeded to walk through the middle of the active fire (at least twice) without the required PPE and stated that the fire was 'just a little smoke' and 'not that hot'. At that time the fire was making repeated runs and jumping the road at various points. He then advised the local Police Chief to bring his firefighters up the road directly through the active fire. Again, the safety officer intervened and told the Police Chief that the firefighters in question were in a safe spot on a beach and that he should leave them where they were.

At this point, radio traffic concerning the arrival of an Incident Commander from another Ranger District caused the member of management to change his plans again and assigned one of the module members to take the truck and pick up the IC at the airport. He then assigned the remaining module members to wait at the spot on the road with no lookout in place, no good view of the main fire, no egress vehicle, and no bear protection rifle until he returned from a reconnaissance flight. The remaining module members disregarded this order and proceeded to the point of origin to await the new incident commander.

The new IC assumed command of the Muskeg Fire and immediately ordered all forest service personnel off the fire until communications can be established amongst all the participating agencies and resources.

This SAFENET seeks to call into question the judgment and decisions of this member of management and to highlight the lack of adherence to established agency safety policies and protocol concerning wildland firefighting. In the wake of the South Canyon, Thirtymile, and the Cramer fire fatalities, the decisions and actions displayed by this individual during the Muskeg Fire cannot be condoned, ignored or tolerated. This sentiment becomes far more dramatic when the individual in question is a fire program manager and a supervisor. I have only scratched the surface of the blatant disregard for agency fire suppression safety policies and protocols as this narrative only highlights 4-5 hours of suppression operations on this incident.

The following is the initial list of violations of the '10 Standard Firefighting Orders' that I have compiled:

KEEP INFORMED ON FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND FORECASTS

There was a 'red flag' warning issued on 04/29/05 for high winds and low relative humidities. This information was never passed on to any agency firefighters assigned to initial attack operations. No briefing was ever given to cover the immediate and forecasted weather.

KNOW WHAT YOUR FIRE IS DOING AT ALL TIMES

There was no lookout posted during initial attack. The member of management could not see the main fire from his position and was not in contact with someone who could.

BASE ALL ACTION ON CURRENT AND EXPECTED BEHAVIOR OF THE FIRE

The member of management’s plan to engage 3 firefighters in constructing hand line in an Alaskan muskeg with no anchor point against a fast moving fire containing 20' flame lengths is very dangerous, against established engagement policies, and preposterous.

IDENTIFY ESCAPE ROUTES AND SAFETY ZONES AND MAKE THEM KNOWN

No escape routes or safety zones were either identified or communicated.

POST LOOKOUTS WHEN THERE IS POSSIBLE DANGER

No lookouts were posted during the time in question.

BE ALERT, KEEP CALM THINK CLEARLY, ACT DECISIVELY

The decisions made by the member of management were clearly unsafe and showed very little experience or concern for personnel safety.

MAINTAIN PROMPT COMMUNICATIONS WITH YOUR FORCES, YOUR SUPERVISOR, AND ADJOINING FORCES

During initial attack of the Muskeg Fire, there was no common frequency for all the resources on the fire. None of the entities on the fire could communicate with the other. The member of management directed his module to engage in suppression operations in direct violation of established agency/district protocol.

GIVE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS AND ENSURE THEY ARE UNDERSTOOD

No clear orders were ever given and the member of management was continually changing his engagement strategies. No briefing was ever given to any resources on the Muskeg Fire.

MAINTAIN CONTROL OF YOUR FORCES AT ALL TIMES

The FFT1 in charge of the fire module disregarded the FMO's request to stay on the road and await his return.

FIGHT FIRE AGGRESSIVELY, HAVING PROVIDED FOR SAFETY FIRST

Safety was never provided for during the initial phases of the Muskeg Fire. The member of management did not have a valid 'red card', he was not wearing the required PPE, and he directly violated all 10 of the STANDARD FIREFIGHTING ORDERS, 13 of the 18 WATCHOUT SITUATIONS (1,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,14,15,16) and did not meet any requirements under LCES.

The 18 Watch Out Situations that were not mitigated adequately are:

1. FIRE NOT SCOUTED AND SIZED UP.

The Muskeg Fire was never adequately scouted out or sized up by the member of management.

2. IN COUNTRY NOT SEEN IN DAYLIGHT.

N/A

3. SAFETY ZONES AND ESCAPE ROUTES NOT IDENTIFIED.

Safety zones and escape routes were neither identified nor communicated to any agency personnel.

4. UNFAMILIAR WITH WEATHER AND LOCAL FACTORS INFLUENCING FIRE BEHAVIOR.

There was a red flag warning posted for the day of the fire and the member of management as well as a fire module individual were unaware of it.

5. UNINFORMED ON STRATEGY, TACTICS, AND HAZARDS.

No briefing was ever given to clearly identify strategy, tactics, and hazards. The member of management changed his plans repeatedly throughout the initial phases of the incident.

6. INSTRUCTIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS NOT CLEAR.

There was no clear agency IC. This member of management stated that he was here as his district role and not a firefighter and then began 'suggesting' suppression strategies to all resources on the fire. He then gave direct orders to the fire module to engage in suppression operations.

7. NO COMMUNICATION LINK WITH CREW MEMBERS/SUPERVISOR.

There was no common frequency for all the resources working on the incident. There were helicopters engaging in suppression efforts that had no communications with agency personnel.

8. CONSTRUCTING FIRELING WITHOUT A SAFE ANCHOR POINT.

The fireline proposed by the member of management had no secure anchor point. The area where he proposed anchoring from was subsequently completely consumed by the fire.

9. BUILDING FIRLINE DOWNHILL WITH FIRE BELOW.

N/A

10. ATTEMPTING FRONTAL ASSAULT ON FIRE.

The member of management planned a frontal assault on the head of the Muskeg Fire.

11. UNBURNED FUEL BETWEEN YOU AND FIRE.

Large areas of unburned fuel existed between the proposed line construction and the assigned firefighters.

12. CANNOT SEE MAIN FIRE, NOT IN CONTACT WITH ANYONE WHO CAN.

No lookout was posted and no one could see what the fire was doing from their position on the road.

13. ON A HILLSIDE WHERE ROLLING MATERIAL CAN IGNITE FUEL BELOW.

N/A

14. WEATHER IS GETTING HOTTER AND DRIER.

There was a 'red flag' fire weather warning posted for both the day of the incident and the previous day for high temperatures and low relative humidities.

15. WIND INCREASES AND/OR CHANGES IN DIRECTION.

'Red Flag' winds were forecast for the day and gusts to 25mph were recorded on the fire.

16. GETTING FREQUENT SPOT FIRES ACROSS THE LINE.

The fire was observed to be spotting in many places along the perimeter.

17. TERRAIN AND FUELS MAKE ESCAPE TO SAFETY ZONES DIFFICULT.

N/A

18. TAKING A NAP NEAR FIRELINE

N/A

Not one component of LCES was in place at the time the member of management directed the fire module to engage in hand line construction!

The Muskeg Fire serves as notice to me that this individual either does not fully understand his duties as a fire supervisor or blatantly disregards established agency firefighting safety policies, procedures, and regulations.","1. I would strongly encourage that the facts that I disclosed concerning the conduct of this member of management during the Muskeg Fire be verified by agency safety managers and any justified actions be taken to ensure the safety of any firefighting personnel assigned to this District.

2. I would suggest that firefighting personnel who are given unsafe assignments initiate the 'turn down' protocol referenced in the Incident Response Pocket Guide, pages 18 and 19.

3. A minimum red carded qualification (i.e. division supervisor) be instituted before being eligible for duty as a fire supervisor on the Tongass National Forest.

4. A 'mutual aid' agreement be put in place and honored by all participants between the Volunteer Fire Department and the Ranger District.","05/09/2005 00:00"

These individuals repeatedly left the IC out of the loop and broke the chain of command to the point of contradicting the IC's decisions. The IC kept a professional attitude and kept firefighter and public safety at the forefront of his decisions. The IC did an excellent job throughout the incident while trying to deal with what seemed like a separate command entity. One of these individuals repeatedly argued and questioned the IC's decisions to evacuate a farm community located at the head of the fire that was in direct threat of the fire. These disagreements occurred over the radio where all personnel could overhear the conversations. The other individual opened a road that the IC had closed to all traffic but fire vehicles without consulting with or telling the IC. This was not communicated to the IC until the person posted at the road to keep traffic out contacted the IC with the information that the individual declared the road open. This individual also called the fire controlled on 4/30/2005 at 2000 without consulting the IC or even telling the IC he had called it controlled. The IC did not learn of this until 5/01/2005. There was some sort of power trip going on with these two individuals. The IC's decisions and performance were exemplary and he should in no way be found at fault or deficient. I was dumbfounded at the lack of communication and recognition of the IC's authority by these two individuals.","These two individuals should be reacquainted with basic ICS, reprimanded and on of the should be removed from this position.","05/06/2005 00:00"

My engine with three individuals took an EF Johnson radio to the Bosque Fire as a Type 2 Management Team was taking over. This was the first time I have allowed one of these radios on my engine for field-testing this year.

The team was unable to program the EF Johnson, and sounds like this will not change in the near future (via Communications).

After hand programming the radio, past issues came up. NO COMMUNICATION with any individual carrying an EF Johnson radio. It was quicker and easier to communicate with a runner than trying to get messages through on radio. The radio would transmit fine at short distances (shouting distance), however would not receive most messages.

I could communicate with any individual carrying a King radio with my King radio, however my firefighter with the EF Johnson could not always communicate with other radios...other EF Johnsons, Racals, Kings, or other.

The volume on these radios is still unacceptable. Any background noise, regardless of how loud it was, would drown out messages coming over radio.

I was able to play with the EF Johnson radio for awhile and get it programmed and get a scan list set up, however, if there is a manual somewhere out there that explains the different functions, and programming procedures no one in this office has seen or heard of one.

I am not just trying to hammer the EF Johnson radios. I have gone into the field with an open mind every time we got them back from getting a new software version downloaded. They simply aren’t working for us at this time.","Fire season is upon us; my crew WILL NOT be field-testing these radios any longer during fire season. We have dealt with these same issues time and again in the past, as we still are.

With the multiple software versions that have been programmed into these radios, most people no longer know what functions the radio can perform or how to enable those functions (lack of something as simple as a manual).    At the time, I hand programmed the radio so my firefighter, (an Engine Boss Trainee) had the needed frequencies.

I then had to keep this firefighter within shouting distance so we could communicate.","04/13/2005 00:00"

Curious and concerned, we proceeded to the location of the smoke via a Type 6 engine (non-NWCG Type) with one Polaris Ranger ATV. After arriving at the fire a quick size up was made in order to properly inform the county dispatch, as was done on scene. A page then went out (as suggested by my supervisor) for at least 2 VFD's to respond to the fire. My supervisor and I proceeded back to the office to change into nomex and obtain PPE. Upon returning to the fire, which was approx. 200 acres and burning in grass, timber and brush, we (my supervisor and I herein) rode the ATV to the heel of the fire, planning to stop it from jumping a ditch and igniting an adjacent native grass field. At this point, no briefing was received by responding VFD's and no IC was assigned and/ or noted. After subduing the main fire we proceeded to attack an eastern flank with a 'pump and roll' strategy. After successfully carrying out this operation, my supervisor met up with a MN DNR wildlife managers whom I had met prior to the fire IA. They seemed to be free lancing as I was unaware of a dispatch notice to them. After my supervisor met with the wildlife managers, I was informed that a burnout operation would be carried out to void the area of a potential hazard. Approx. 100 acres was to be fired. With no communication with the wildlife personnel firing off the road towards us, we noticed a column establishing and began our back burn west to east having first tied into the black. After completing half of our back burn and trying many times to reach the MN DNR personnel on the radio, we became 'socked in' with smoke from the on-coming head fire and had to escape the lowering visibility and oncoming flame. We proceeded to the east flank in the direction of our back burn operation and began to extinguish the oncoming head fire after anchoring off a ditch. It was not until the firing ops were out that I had tied in with the wildlife personnel. Having questionable authority with my FFT1 and ICT5 qualification, I did not voice my concern or opposition. There was no incident commander identified nor was there a plan or action communicated to all personnel, a critical link in safe fire fighting ops.

The crewmember that came to assist was not very familiar with Racal radios. After an extended period in which operations were held up to address the problem it was solved by turning the radio off and disconnecting the battery, reconnecting the battery and turning the radio back on.

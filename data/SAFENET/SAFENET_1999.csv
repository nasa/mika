I was made aware of an individual with the FWS that was previously employed by a Structural Fire Dept. In 1999, this individual was employed as a seasonal FFT2 with the FWS and had no previous wildfire experience. In 2001 the individual took a job as a permanent employee with the FWS. Since 1999 the individual has attained FFT1, ENGB, RXB3, RXB2, ICT4, CRWB, STEN, TFLD, FACL, WHSP, SEMG and they are currently working on ICT3 and DIVS. All of these quals were attained by the end of 2003 except SEMG. SEMG was attained in one fire season 2004. Is it possible to attain this many qualifications in less then five years? This may be a tragedy incident waiting to happen.","Review suspicious qualification. Review qualification process.

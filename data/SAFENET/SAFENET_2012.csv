This was the second day of field excersises with many of the participants already having previous chainsaw experience. At approximately 1330 hours, Group Two, which consisted of a Group Leader, Sawyer,Swamper and a Lookout, was conducting their training felling exercise when the tree that was being cut had some undetected live vines in the upper portion of the canopy that were connected to a nearby dead snag. Once the cut was made and the tree began to fall from its stump, it fell into another tree located in front and slightly to the right of the cut tree and this plus the vines prevented the cut tree from falling to the ground. The Sawyer and the Swamper moved out of the fall zone and discussed their options with their Group Leader. After a brief discussion, the Group Leader, Sawyer and Swamper went back into the fall zone and started to evaluate what was preventing the cut tree from falling. As they reentered the fall zone, the cut tree became dislodged and continued to fall bringing with it the top portion of a snag that was located behind the crew. As the cut tree began to fall the top slid down the standing tree forcing the base of the cut tree to move in the direction of the cutting crew. As the Lookout observed this chain of events occurring, he noticed the snag behind them beginning to fall and gave a shout of warning to the crew located within the fall zone, however the tree came down with in a matter of seconds. When the cutting crew heard the “shout of warning” they began to exit the fall zone area using the predesignated escape routes at 45 degree angles away from the base of the cut tree. The Sawyer moved back and to the left of the cut tree, the Swamper moved left at 45 degree angle from the cut tree and when the Group Leader turned to his right to escape from the falling cut tree(that was in front of him), he turned into the snag that was falling from behind his location and thus leading to the snag striking him on the left side of his helmet rendering him unconscious at approximently 1344 hours. The segment that fell and inflicted injury was approximately 20 feet long and 8 inches in diameter and fell from a distance of roughly 30 feet. The Swamper and Sawyer immediately went to the Group Leaders aid and began patient care as trained First Responders. The Swamper supported the Group Leader’s cervical spine while the Sawyer (who is not an agency employee) was attempting to call for help but did not know how to work a FFS radio. The Swamper called for an onsite EMT using the radio but the call was not clearly understood. The Swamper called a second time and the traffic was answered by the Ops Chief. The Ops Chief did not clearly understand the call but asked if someone needed assistance. The Swamper answered yes, and that Group Two needs an EMT because a tree fell on the Group Leader. At 1345 hours,EMTs heard the radio traffic and responded to Group Two’s location. When the EMTs arrived,they found the patient lying on his back, semi-unconscious and disoriented. The EMTs instructed the Ops Chief to call 911 while they completed their patient assessment. Due to the mechanism of injury and loss of consciousness, it was determined to request air medical transport. The EMTs started treating the Firefighter for head injuries, multiple abrasions and numbness to his right side. At 1355 hours,Fire Rescue arrived on scene. Due to the quick response of the onsite agency EMTs, all life threatening wounds were exposed and treated by the time patient care was transferred to Fire Rescue for transport to a nearby preestablished helispot. At 1413 hours, the patient was airlifted to the Trauma Center where he received surgery to fuse two vertebrae in his neck and was treated for a concussion and fractured orbital socket.","Training courses have the potential to be as hazardous as conducting the same type of work on wildland fires. For this reason we should always strive to provide the safest working/training environment possible. The following are lessons learned at the conducted AAR the following day that will allow us to study and prevent<br/>further occurrence:<br/>¿ Reassess to maintain Situational Awareness – Once the cut tree was hung-up in the vines and was leaning up against the tree directly in front it, the cutting team left the fall zone. After a brief discussion the decision was made to reenter the fall zone. While this decision was necessary to get a closer look at the tree’s position, it ultimately led to the Group Leaders injuries.<br/>o Always reevaluate your Situational Awareness based on current conditions<br/>(Look up, Look Down and Look All Around). This will allow for the best<br/>possible decisions to be made based on the most current and accurate<br/>information observed.<br/>¿ Use proper call for help - The Swamper called for an EMT but the call was not clearly understood. The Swamper called a second time and the traffic was answered by the Ops Chief. The Ops Chief did not clearly understand the call but asked if someone needed assistance. The Swamper answered yes, and that Group Two needs an EMT because a tree fell on the Group Leader. It was then understood that there was an emergency and the onsite EMT's responded. <br/>¿ Have plan in place for accidents involving instructors – While conducting the After Action Review, it was said that the instructors were briefed on what to do in case of an emergency involving a student but there was no clear plan in place for an emergency involving an instructor.All instructions listed in the IAP for an Emergency Procedure should be reviewed in detail for the participants and instructors. This will allow for each individual to ask questions and have a clear understanding of their roll<br/>in the event of an emergency incident. <br/>¿ Have more than one radio per group – Group Two only had one radio in their group and it was assigned to the Group Leader. Had this radio sustained any damage and became inoperable, it would have left the group with no communications to call for help.","04/30/2013 07:50"

I received a reply on Admin and we began a system of tests on Admin and Forest net to check the system. I could hear Plumas on both channels loud and clear, but Plumas ECC could only hear me on Admin net. All my transmissions on Forest Net were garbled and unreadable. Plumas ECC then shifted all East side traffic to Admin net. From what I could tell is all the repeaters on the East side for Forest net were not functioning properly. This became a safety concern for my module and the public. Our station is a out station with extremely limited cell phone ability. Sometimes our only form of communication is through the radio network. We quite regularly run across or have medical aides come into our station. The best and fastest way to get help to these people is through our ECC which we were unable to contact on our main radio network today. It also causes problems for fire response on the forest with different districts and resources working on different radio nets.

The quote is referring to times that crew are allowed to run on the incident.

'The crew's time will stop when the crew arrives back at the fire / spike camp. The DIVS may authorize Crew Boss/ Engine Boss up to one hour of administrative time to post crew time, deal with medical and financial issues and check on the general welfare of their crews. The DIVS may authorize the crew/engine boss to approve selected (1-3) individuals 30 minutes to refurbish equipment, gas vehicles, order/obtain replacement supplies.'

The above quote is creating an unsafe work environment for crews/engines that are working on the McGuire Complex for the Northern Rockies team. The reason why this creating an unsafe work environment is because crew/engines are not being allowed proper time to get fire ready before next day’s shift. Example of fire readiness that occur in camp before next day’s shift include: sharpening of all crew members tools, sharpening of all chainsaws, cleaning of chainsaws, fueling and mixing fuel for chainsaws, refilling crews drinking water, getting medical supplies, treating medical conditions, gear and PPE safety inspections, vehicle cleaning(window, mirrors), paperwork(CTRs,CA-1s,214's,crew/engine log), vehicle repair/vehicle safety and P.M. checks, radio repair, cloning radios, camp briefing, rolling hose, making hose packs, filling engine with water, replacement of bad PPE, supply needs. Any of the above items missed because of time constraints can jeopardize the effectiveness and safety of a crew/engine. Only the crew/engine boss is able to effectively make the judgment of how much time is required to get their crew fire ready and safe for the next day’s shift. Asking a DIVS for more time does not solve the problem. Young engine boss and Type 2 crew bosses are not going to feel comfortable asking a DIVS for another hour to refurb their crew, they are more likely to go without their crews needs or do it while not getting compensated.

It’s sad to see a type 1 Incident Management team more worried about nit picking an hour here and there then ensuring its assigned engine/crew boss have adequate time to make safe and fire ready their crews/engines for the next day shift.

Another unsafe practice this team uses is not provided briefing maps for its crew/engine bosses. A map is huge part of your basic situational awareness, it tells you where the fire perimeter is, how deep the next canyon is, what roads take you to your safety zones. I know paper and ink is expensive but is it worth a crew boss miss judging where the fire perimeter is or an engine boss taking a wrong turn in route to their safety zone because they were not giving a map.","","10/10/2012 00:00"

09/25/12..Team 1 transitions with Team 3, throughout the entire day no one from Team 3 contacts Branch Director. Team 3 assumes control of incident at 1800.

I observe that Branch Director maintains control of operations of Branch 3 and divisions G,H,J, as well planning for night shift and the next days activities. I witness multiple attempts by him to contact the new Operations at Northfork, ID ICP. I saw nor heard any attempt by the  Team 3 to contact Branch Director. At approx. 2130 a minor accident involving one of the engine crews from night shift was reported to Branch Director, he made the necessary arrangements with medical to begin the care and transport of the patient, he then tried to contact ICP operations via phone with no success, he then asked Communications to call ICP and the Team 3 Operations via radio. I again observed no response by Team 3.

09/26/12..Branch Directorhad the usual and necessary briefings for the Divisions, I asked him if he had any contact with the new operations, he replied no. At approx. 1300 I engaged in a conversation with the existing Div J supervisor and the new Team 3 replacement as well as his trainee. I had no previous knowledge of any new command staff and was interested to know more about the changes occurring. At approx 1530, I met with Branch Director in the Ops tent at Scripps Camp, he was with the Team 3 Ops, shortly after my arrival, Team 3 Ops' trainee arrived. I witnessed and engaged in a conversation with all parties mentioned. At this time it was discovered that the new team had placed into the field of operations new division supervisors and had not instructed them to tie in with the current operational overhead, Branch Director. They however had them (the new Divs) communicate directly with them at ICP. (one should note that at this point in time was the first direct communications between the new team operations and Branch Director the acting operations)

My observations as briefly described above leads me to conclude that the lack of communication by Team 3 and their insertion of command staffing, circumventing the chain of command, is a very unsafe practice and potentially hazardous.","I engaged in a conversation with Branch Director and explained what I had seen. I verified my observations with him as to the nature of the situation and that I felt it was a potentially dangerous activity on the part of Team 3, he agreed. I then informed my Fire Chief of what I had observed. He had been in contact with the Team 3 IC and a time was arranged to meet with him the IC on 09/27/12 at around 1400. It was at this meeting that I brought these facts to the IC's attention. He informed me that he was aware of the mishandling of the Operations Overhead and that steps were being taken to remedy the situation. I observed no corrections after this commitment, other than to place the blame for the mishandling on Branch Director and demob him.

It is my opinion that the Branch Director was undeserving of this action and Team 3's reasons for their behavior were contrary to my observations.","09/28/2012 00:00"

The engine responded to an initial attack fire, the Wilson fire on the 26th.  While performing pump and roll operations during full suppression/mop up activities, the engine crew heard a loud 'bang' as they were driving the engine downhill, and slightly across a gentle slope.  The slope was very gentle, nothing outside of safe operation for that particular type 4 engine.  Upon inspection of the flat bed (pump package) of the engine, the crew discovered that the entire flatbed structure had shifted forward, the air chucks having punctured 2 small holes in the cab.  Additionally, the bed had slid 6 inches to the passenger side.  The crew inspected the undercarriage, and noticed bent and displaced U-bolts, as well as plastic spacers out of position.  The Engine Boss, who was on detail on theis engine (not his engine) phoned the engine's captain who was on the home unit in Utah.  The captain advised the engine boss to get the engine off of the fire and into a shop if he felt he could safely do so, or to seek a recovery/field service company to come to the fire to assist.  The Engine Boss felt confident that the truck could be taken slowly to Billings, which was a very short distance from the fire.  The Engine Boss contacted the IC, and the engine was released from the fire, and made it safely to a heavy truck shop in Billings.<br/><br/>The home unit engine captain contacted the Forest Safety Officer and Forest FMO to advise them of the situation.  The captain explained his concerns that this incident had the potential to be very devastating if the incident had occurred at higher speeds, or on steeper slopes.  The captain expressed concerns that this situation posed high risk to firefighter safety, and had the potential to cause catastrophic injury or even loss of life.  Additionally, had the shift occurred on a highway, there could have also been implications to civilian life and safety.  The FMO and Forest Safety officer shared similar concerns of the incident, and determined they would pass the concerns to fleet managers and safety officers at the Forest and regional level.  It was also determined to advise fire management staff on the Bridger Teton National Forest, as they also operate the other 3 Montana Meatalworks manufactured types 4's in the region.  At this time, it was determined to make necessary repairs that would allow the engine to return home safely, where additional inspection and modification would be performed.<br/>Upon inspection at a heavy truck shop in Billings, specialists determined that the U-Bolts that attached the flatbed structure to the frame were inadequate to hold the weight and configuration.  Additionally, hard plastic spacers used as a “bushing” between the flatbed and frame rails were of poor material to perform the job, and the bushings had slid out of position.  U bolts were bent and missing.<br/>"," The shop repositioned the flatbed, replacing the original bushings.  They also reattached and replaced U-Bolts, and additionally added more U-bolts.  Shop specialists confirmed that the additional bolts would be adequate to hold the structure to complete the detail and return trip home.  They suggested replacing the bushings with a more hard rubber material, or oak planks.  These materials would allow the bed and frame to 'bite' into the material, holding it more firmly in place.  <br/><br/>Engine 441 is a USFS 'model 52' type 4 engine that was received in 2009, and went into service in 2012.  Upon receipt, the engine failed the national standards for tilt requirements, and underwent modifications to bring the apparatus into compliance.  Spacers were removed from the suspension, per inspection and suggestion by Freightliner engineers.  Additionally, the flat bed was removed by a local vendor, and modified to lower the structure.  The bed was mounted back to the truck exactly as it had been prior to modification, as it had been upon receipt from the manufacturer (Montana Metalworks, Missoula, MT.  Once the apparatus had brought into tilt compliance, work was completed to fix paint issues, and minor modifications to plumbing to bring the complete package up to model 52 specs.  Upon completion, the truck entered service in April, 2012.  <br/><br/>It has been determined that the cause of the incident was due to inadequate design and use of the hard plastic spacers and to few U-bolts.  It appears that modification efforts prior to the incident did not factor into the incident, as the Bridger Teton engines did not go through modification, and have the same design flaws that led to this incident.  Additionally, upon inspection of older type 4 model 52 engines built prior to this engine (in Sparks, NV) had different design features that would not allow the structure to shift if U-bolts failed.  On those engines, metal plates attached to the flatbed structure sit between frame rails, creating a 'block' or 'wedge' that more effectively secures the structure in place.  These tucks also feature oak planks as a bushing between the flatbed and frame rails.  <br/><br/>Corrective action has not yet been implemented however; the local unit is in the process of gathering information and receiving estimates on attaching the metal plates, and replacing the bushings with a more adequate material.<br/><br/>It should also be documented that the home unit captain is has stated to the Forest FMO and Safety officer that he does not feel comfortable having himself or crew in operate the engine until full repairs/modifications have been performed, and an individual with appropriate and recognized credentials (DOT, automotive engineering, etc.) inspects the apparatus and approves/validates the apparatus as safe and fit for duty.  At this time the truck is out of service.<br/>","11/26/2012 10:34"

(168.400 Mhz; toned at 114.8 kHz)

On Friday, September 21, 2012, at approximately 1600 hours, there was heard unrelated Gilead Fire traffic being transmitted from the NIFC repeater; configured with receive frequency 168.400 MHz and a transmit frequency of 166.6125Mhz, whereby, the receiver was private line toned to 114.8 kHz. Here after referred to as, “COMMAND 1”.

It was observed that this timeframe coincided with a new fire start, which came to be known as, “The Border Fire” and was located to the northeast from the Gilead Fire. The radio traffic was very prominent indicating that the frequency used was not a bleed over from a neighboring frequency, but from being on the same frequency and using the same private line tone as COMMAND 1.

At the onset of the offending radio traffic, the radio traffic was incidental and light. But became more problematic and more frequent as time progressed, which was during critical burnout operations that were occurring on the Gilead Fireline. This fireline was located in rough, rugged and remote locations that necessitated the importance of the COMMAND 1 repeater’s usage and had been identified as their primary line of communication and the avenue to convey emergency traffic to Gilead ICP; noting there was no cellular phone service in that location.

The fireline crew had established a spike camp and maintained the camp throughout the night. The offending traffic persisted into the night and early morning, with almost continuous traffic from 0100 and 0400 hrs, on September 22, 2012. During this timeframe, many crew members had turned off their radio, which posed a serious safety concern as any emergency information that needed to be conveyed to the spike camp could not have been made from Gilead ICP to the spike camp on COMMAND 1; their only means of communication into the spike camp. The action of turning off their radio was in efforts for the fireline crew to manage their sleep, which was seriously being impacted by the offending traffic.

Efforts were made to ascertain who was generating the offending traffic. Cody Interagency Dispatch Center, Billings Dispatch Center, Miles City Dispatch Center, Casper Dispatch Center were contacted. It was requested, by Casper Dispatch, that patience be used until 1200 hours on September 22, 2012 as incident authority had yet to be established on the Border Fire.

When the radio inference was not removed by 1200 hours on September 22, 2012, attempts were made again to identify the offending party. The Border Fire was contacted and the problem was explained and efforts were made to attempt to identify the offending party by the Border Fire. The Sheridan County Fire District was contacted to possibly identify the offending party without success, except for the possibility of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.

The Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation was contacted. There was no co-operation from their agency, even to the extent of providing their operating frequency. It was expressed that they were “too busy in an initial attack and” we “would have to deal with” the interference “until” they “had the initial attack under control”.

Cody Interagency Dispatch Center was again contacted and extensively involved in attempts to identify the offending party.

Fire burnout operation efforts continued on September 22, 2012, at approximately 1200 hours. During the mid to late morning and into the early afternoon, of September 22, 2012, the offending traffic became extremely laden upon the COMMAND 1 repeater; whereby, adding unnecessary taxing to the COMMAND 1 repeater batteries. Radio traffic was being interrupted on tactical frequencies due to scan functions in the line crew’s portable radios and the COMMAND 1 repeater breaking squelch with the offending traffic. This became problematic to the extent that the communications plan was changed disjointedly, which resulted in non-cohesive communications throughout the Gilead Fire. The change was established, by some, to report all emergency communications, if possible, through a second NIFC repeater located at the southern end of the fire, referred to as COMMAND 2. Others understood that all communications were to be made through COMMAND 2 instead of using COMMAND 1 in its entirety.

When communications were established on the COMMAND 2 repeater from the spike camp area, communications were barely discernible through the noise and were scratchy at best; often required repeated transmissions to convey a good copy of radio traffic.

Cody Interagency Dispatch Center contacted the Gilead Fire and informed that they had identified the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation Fire Agency as the offending party; whereby, they were using 168.400 MHz as their tactical frequency. It is noteworthy to mention that only a portion of the fire crew on the Northern Cheyenne Fire were using the 168.400 MHz frequency with the 114.8 kHz private line tone enabled. Additionally, if cooperation was had, those few individuals using the offending frequency, with the private line enabled, could have been identified and instructed to remove the 114.8 kHz private line tone from their radios, which would have resulted in successful conclusion to this radio interference issue in its entirety.

The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) was contacted and advised of the situation. Their recommendation was to proceed with a change to the COMMAND 1 repeater private line tone, from 114.8 kHz to 146.2 KHz, as an immediate relief to the Gilead Fire. Old documentation was obtained that the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation maintained a secondary Radio Frequency Authorization (RFA) for the use of 168.400 MHz to the NIFC RFA primary use. Verification of the documentation will be confirmed as current before additional action is taken by NIFC.","The recommendation to change COMMAND 1’s private line tone from 114.8 kHz to 146.2 kHz by the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) was put into action and changes were made to the COMMAND 1 repeater at 1832 hrs on September 22, 2012;

Whereby, additional helicopter resources were utilized to make the private line tone changes,

Whereby, additional hazardous exposure to rough and remote, unimproved helicopter landing spot were endured, placing crew and equipment at unnecessary risk.

Whereby, mid-operational period frequency changes were made, which increased disjointed communications exposures in the event of emergency medical operations.

Whereby, reduction of COMMAND 1 repeater usage results in a reduction in battery usage;

Whereby, results in limiting hazardous exposures to crew members and more efficient utilization of resources.

Since COMMAND 1 private line tone has been changed, no offending traffic has broken squelch on the COMMAND 1 repeater. COMMAND 1 will continue to be monitored for unauthorized radio transmissions.","09/23/2012 00:00"

It laso deals with lack of sufficient support to resolve this issue over a holiday weekend which resulted in violation of the rest to work ratio.

On 8/30 I requested a pool account to be established for a new employee being filled via a resource order. This individual needed access to the FS network to coordinate with other information officers on the fire and with Area Command on the Mustang and Halsted fires. The Forest Service CIO established an account but when we tried to access it we were not able to. We waited a day and tried again but still were not able to access so we called the help desk and they reset the password. This still didn't work but were told they were experiencing network issue and to try again the next day (9/1). We tried again on Saturday and had no success and called the help desk again. They attempted to resolve the issue by establishing a new account which once again failed. After several hours they basically stated they would need to elevate the issue to Tier II support - which would respond back to us within 4 days (supposedly but lately it has been as long as 10 days). On Sunday (9/2) I contacted the help desk again and stated I needed to speak to the supervisor as I needed the account to work today in order to perform our emergency duties. I also tried to contact 3 different customer service representative to raise the issue at a higher level but there was not coverage over the holiday weekend. I once again contacted the help desk and talk this time to a supervisor who spent the better part of 3 hours with me trying to resolve the issue.

I was the only person the help desk would speak with directly as I was the only one who was a permanent FS employee and was the supervisor of the new employee pool account - thus responsible. Sunday had been my scheduled day off to be consistent with work to rest guidelines but I ended up spending over 4 and a half hours working on this issue instead. The lack of coverage by service representatives and a short staff on the help desk plus the lack of quick response by Tier II support put not only myself but others into unsafe situations. Fortunately nothing blew up that day but given the nature of the work this could have been a recipe for disaster and demonstrates a gap in appropriate support for our incidents. I think we often overlook the dependency we have on technology to manage such incidents and we are definitely not providing adequate coverage in support of this incidents during critical periods.

Upon resolving the issue which supposedly was related to server recognition on the local level we then encountered problem with the WDE (encryption) for the laptop and we're basically told not to sign off the computer or we would have the same issues again. This resulted in a security violation and vulnerability.","As mentioned I personnally had to take additional actions to get an appropriate response from the computer support. This resulted in violation of work to rest ratio. To help mitigate the security violation we placed the laptop in a drawer at night but kept it connected to the network.

Standards for mop up on the Water Fall 2 fire were established at 300 feet in all divisions with the exception of M which is inaccessible, and 100% mop up of all spots. Terrain in divisions varies from relatively flat to 60% or greater slope, fuels consist of mixed pine and fir with numerous snags per acre and heavy dead and downed material over large areas.

At 1303 hours, the crew were mopping up and snagging at the 250 to 300 foot distance when a falling swamper was struck on the right shoulder by a top knocked out of a tree. The tree top was about 2 to 2½ feet long and about 1 to 2 inches in diameter and fell from 50 to 70 feet from a tree. The tree that was felled was around 10” DBH and in the 50-70 foot range and as it fell struck another tree knocking out the top which impacted the swamper. The swamper was around three feet away from the faller at the time of the accident, and was wearing all PPE properly. A line medic evaluated the injured firefighter and was determined to have non life threatening injuries and was then transported to the ICP Medical Unit for evaluation and was then sent to the hospital for follow-up.

The concern in this instance is risk and exposure to firefighters in the mop-up phase, often units will set hard standards such as the determined 300 foot mop-up standards in heavy snag areas. Numerous hours of firefighter and faller exposure is associated with hard fast mop-up standards in steep or heavy snag areas and puts them at undue risk and more often than not risk outweighs the benefit. Units need to consider firefighter exposure in the mop up phase, and weigh risk vs. benefits when establishing standards for mop-up.","IMT Safety Officers reviewed medical procedures, operational hazards, mitigations and use of safe practices.

The fire had assigned 'drop points' for either delivering or receiving equipment or people. That day I had two deliveries of equipment to a drop point assigned the number DP13. I work on the Plumas and was familiar with the area. I, in fact, had surveyed the roads in this area this year in anticipation of an upcoming timber sale. The road to this drop point that was activily being used by all fire resources was 26N22. What was unusual was that this road went directly through the uncontained fire. The fire had burned through days earlier and was still smouldering and burning materials. This road was approximately 9 miles long. For approximately the last half of the road the timber inside the fire line had not burned. The next day (Sun., August 26) I was assigned to pick up two injured firefighters and their crew boss at DP13 ( at approimately 1600 hrs). I used the same route as the day before thinking that the road would be marked as closed if there was any danger. As I encountered the second half of the road the smoke and burning intensified. I continued on thinking that it would be a small area as we had gone through similar conditions the day earlier. I soon realized that I could be in a life threatening condition. I decided to continue through thinking that the road back was just as bad or worse than the road ahead. The smoke was so intense that three times I almost came to a complete stop but I knew that I had to keep moving.I was able to make it through to DP13, but realized that I had come through 4-5 miles of an actively burning forest fire. I called ground support and informed them to mark the road closed so no future people would make the same mistake that I had made. The reason that I am reporting this is to help in the future so that this doesn't happen again. The main thing that needs to happen is to make sure that roads are clearly marked as conditions change that should be closed or to be used as needed.","I immediatly contacted ground support and gave them my assessment of the situation and advised them to close the road until deemed safe by fire personnel.","09/11/2012 00:00"

Around 1400 a snag fell onto the powerline in the vicinity were one of the crews was working. When one of the crew members noticed the tree in the powerline incident management was notified who then informed dispatch. Crew personnel were advised to not touch the tree and flag off the area until representative(s) from the power company could assess the situation. Within 2 hours it was determined by Northwest Energy that the powerlines would have to be de-energized to safely remove the tree. While the power company made arrangements for generators to be employed while the line was de-energized the crews focused work on other areas of the fire. By the end of shift the tree was removed and power restored to the line.","The corrective actions are built into the narrative-meaning that appropriate measures were taken by on scene fire fighters.

The mission was to prep and protect a house and an adjacent cabin from the approaching flame front. The engine module started our shift at 0800 on 8/23 and worked throughout the day on the prep for burnout around the buildings in order to save them. As the evening progressed, it was becoming apparent that there would be no resources for a night shift, that being said, the division sup. and task force leader agreed that keeping us on all night for this structure protection was the best plan. The task force leader ensured that we were self-sufficient and able to work the extended shift, we said yes.

The next morning around 0600 on 8/24, after staying up throughout the night, the fire had progressed to the point where the burnout around the structures was needed. We began the burnout and this would take us until around 1200. At this point the task force leader came to me (Engine Boss) and asked if we could continue to work until 2100 that night and then be able to return to day shift the next day. Before I could even really think it through, he then said, 'well instead of showing that you worked 39 hours straight, just show that you got some rest on your time sheets and we can make up what is owed later'. He then told us that it would be fine and that he is 'kind of old school'. He suggested we show 16 hour days and eventually we would able to catch up on the hours owed that we wouldn't show that we worked (39 hours). From that point, due to fatigue, or lack of judgment, or trust in my overhead, or whatever it was, I agreed while knowing better.

I have been working wildland fire for 10 years and understand fully the reasoning and policy behind the 2 to 1 rule. I am not sure why I was able to be convinced that this method of catching up later was OK but it happened and in the end our module could not make up the time that we missed and ended up being owed 16.625 hours of base wages that now cannot be regained.","Upon return to our home unit, the situation was relayed to the appropriate supervisors. They were less than impressed with the lack of judgment in me, and also in the task force leader. This issue was resolved and will not be going any farther than a verbal reprimand on the local level.

I am sending this safenet just to show that this type of thing is still happening (breaking/flexing) the 2 to 1 rule. I hope that further policy enforcement and less old school thinking will begin to prevail.","09/01/2012 00:00"

I feel that a direct attack could be attempted with the fire staying in place for the last 4 days.

On 8/20/2012, the Rush Fire, the first operational day shift under the direction of the Northern Rockies Type 1 Team I was in communication and witnessed an incident with resources in Div. A. Specifically DOZB 1 and DOZB 2. Each were responsible for Dozers and the operators who were contracted to work on the incident. Division Supervisor was Division A. Eldorado IHC was assigned to Div. A and assisted with road prep along the Buckhorn Rd from DP 12 out to the west along with other resources on the Division in anticipation for nighttime firing operation. On that particular morning it was obvious that there was already active fire behavior due to the column and the south wind we were getting, it was much stronger than the previous mornings. I was in contact with Air Attack over the Division and we discussed the fire behavior and current location of the fire and how much time we had before the fire would impact the Buckhorn Rd. and our location at DP 12, which was Pilgrim Lake, an extremely large dry lake bed that we would use to park in and utilize as a safety zone. Air Attack mentioned to me that we had about 1.5 to 2 hours before the fire would hit Buckhorn Rd, he guessed just west of DP 12. The time was approx. 1000-1030 hrs. We continued to prep the road knowing that we would not complete it and I ended up pulling the crew back to DP 12 and we would monitor the fire behavior. Burning the road at that time did not seem like a viable option due to the stronger South wind we were getting. I didn’t want to add to the fire behavior we were already observing and the risk of exposing resources to hold the road was not a good idea with the fire front we were watching.

I notified the other resources that our IHC was pulling back to DP 12; the other hand crews went out to a safe area to the west a few miles down the Buckhorn Rd. The Strike Team of engines decided to return to DP 12 as well. At this time we observed the fire front, dark wide base, making its way towards DP 12, around 1130-1200. Around this time DOZB 1 with dozers E-126 and E-54 committed down the dozer line that took off from DP 12 to the south to improve it. DOZB 1 told me that they were going down the dozer line and that E-126, D-8 had a radio and if I needed to call him just go direct to him. After I realized what he was doing, a few minutes later I called E-126 and told him to get back to DP 12 due to the increasing fire behavior and its proximity to our location. I then called DOZB 1 on Div. A TAC and told him the fire is coming this way and to get back to DP 12 also. He replied that he is fine and that we should try and burn the dozer line out, I replied to him that there is too much fire and no time to do any burning and for him to get back to DP 12 again, conditions are not good. The column then started to switch and began to curl over the dozer line they were on. I relayed the change in the smoke column to DOZB 1, I told him the column is starting to turn and curl over their position now, he said it was just flanking and they were good. I replied to DOZB 1 to start pushing and improve the parking area that he made which were just wide spots in my opinion, into a safety zone, start pushing a safety zone. He replied once again, they were good. I replied “are you going to ride it out on the dozer line?” He replied yes.

After a few moments past, I heard traffic on TAC, “get in the truck, I’m behind you, get in the truck, I’m behind you, get in the truck.” That traffic was from DOZB 1 to the contract dozer operator with the open cab, E-54. The dozers and DOZB 1 were not accounted for after that for a few minutes. I tried again to contact DOZB 1 on TAC, asked him if everyone was OK, any injuries? He replied no injuries, but the back of the truck had some fire in it, could we send an engine in. It sounded like they took care of the fire in the back of the truck, when the smoke cleared, 2 DOZB’s trucks and 2 Dozers came up to DP 12. DOZB 1 and his dozer worked from DP 12 to the south and I can only speculate that DOZB 2 and his dozer were working from Painters Flat, going north improving dozer line, working towards DOZB 1, when they became entrapped or cutoff from a safety zone. I didn’t know that DOZB 2 was with them until they came out to DP 12. They said the dozer with the enclosed cab pulled the fire curtain and the E-54 dozer, and operator jumped in with DOZB 1. I also heard that the temp gauge inside for air temp outside the truck had reached 171 degrees before it went blank. They told me the dozers had pushed a wide spot in the dozer line before the fire came. DOZB 2 said the fire was flanking them, then all of a sudden it made a run at their location. Both DOZB’s and operators appeared shook-up and in my opinion a little bit in shock. I noticed on DOZB 1's truck, that there was damage to the rear, slightly melted tail lights. I mentioned to Div. A that something serious just happened, burn over, entrapment, close call, near miss, whatever you want to call it. It would be good to get statements and notify Operations. Div. A said they refused to come off the line. Later on that shift in the afternoon, I heard the two DOZB’s re-engaging on the fire, still working. It was unclear to me what notifications were made about the whole incident.

The rest of the fire we were spiked out on different portions of the fire until we timed out. I went and spoke with the team Safety Officer to follow up on what happened. He told me I was the first person to raise any issues with what happened that day. No notifications, no FLA’s, nothing. Down below are NWCG definitions of entrapment and burnover. Call it what you will.

NWCG definition of

Entrapment:

1.	 A situation where personnel are unexpectedly caught in a fire behavior-related, life-threatening position where planned escape routes or safety zones are absent, inadequate, or compromised. An entrapment may or may not include deployment of a fire shelter for its intended purpose. These situations may or may not result in injury. They include 'near misses.'

Burnover:

1.	An event in which a fire moves through a location or overtakes personnel or equipment where there is no opportunity to utilize escape routes and safety zones, often resulting in personal injury or equipment damage.","Spoke with Division Supervisor and explained that an incident had just occured and that it was his responsibility to ensure that there is follow up. Report it to Operations, document event. Remove the resources that were involved. I Approached Team Safety Officer about incident, no one thought it warranted any follow up. The only recommendation I received was to fill out a safe net.","09/18/2012 00:00"

We left Boise, ID at around 07:00 am to return to our home unit Los Padres National Forest, Monterey Ranger District. During the timed traveled we had to be speeding above the speed limit due to the fact that our overhead wanted to make it back in one day which was a 16 hour drive. While traveling back to our home unit we did not stop for any reason only for fuel stops and when we did stop to get fuel everything had to be done quickly; we did not have a lunch stop so we had to quickly grab some kind of snacks from the gas station while at our fuel stop. We eventually arrived at our station at about 11:00 pm putting us on the road for 17 hours due to the one hour time change from Idaho.

The concern with this is that we were all put in danger especially some of the drivers that had to drive over 8 hours, due to the fact that we were speeding, not taking rest stops, and going over our drive time regulations, all because our overhead wanted to get back in one day from a 16 hour drive.","I did not take any action nor did anyone from my crew, due to the fact that our overhead does not listen to any of our issues and did not want to get reprimanded for bringing up the issue of driving past our drive time regulation.","09/12/2012 00:00"

The work performed by 1614C was extremely physically demanding and many of the personnel assigned began to exhibit cumulative fatigue due to the nature and workload of the assignment on 8/18/12.

On 8/18/12 elements of that strike team returned to the home unit after the 14 day assignement and upon return those units were informed that they would receive 2 days of administrative leave after completing shift on 8/18 at 1800 hrs, where they were assigned to be available for initial attack response on the ANF.

The granted 2 days off were in concurrence with Chapter 7 of the Interagency Standards for Fire and Aviation Operations 'Red Book', 2011 edition; and the Interagency Business Management Handbook, 2004 edition. According to both of those documents which share ver batem direction regarding rest days following 14 day assignments, the following is stated:

'After completion of a 14 day assignment and return to the home unit, two mandatory days off will be provided (2 after 14). Days off must occur on the calendar days immediately following the return travel in order to be charged to the incident.'

On 8/18/12 around 1200 hours, the ANF-Copco fire was detected and a dispatch was sent. Elements of that initial attack dispatch fire included personnel and equipment who had been assigned to strike team 1614C, and as such were tasked with the suppression of a fast moving, physically demanding, and challenging initial attack fire. Those personnel were assigned to the ANF-Copco until nearly 2400 hrs on 8/18/12 and were then put off the clock where according to 'Red Book' guidelines, personnel who had been engaging in fire suppression duties for 14 days should have received their 'mandatory days off'. However those personnel did not begin their required 2 days of administrative leave.

Fire Management declared that those personnel who had been assigned to 1614C and were due to receive their administrative days off, would be required to work on 8/19/12 for the day shift and be available for initial attack response, including personnel who had been assigned to the initial attack of the ANF-Copco fire until 2400 hrs the night prior.

This is in direct violation of Red Book and Business Management Handbook that states 'Days off must occur on the calendar days immediately following the return travel in order to be charged to the incident.'

Furthermore, Fire Management determined that those elements of 1614C would not be given 2 days off, and would instead be given only 1 day of administrative leave. That leave was to occur on 8/20/12, more than 24 hours after return to the home unit and with initial attack duties occuring between return to the home unit and the allocated day off. A 2nd day of administative leave was not to be granted.

This is in direct violation of Red Book and Business Management Handbook which states 'After completion of a 14 day assignment and return to the home unit, two mandatory days off will be provided (2 after 14).'

Personnel who had been assigned to 1614C that reported for the mandated shift on 8/19/12 were physically exhausted and not fit for duty in a manner that this fire manager deemed reasonably safe. Fire personnel exhibited cumulative fatigue, muscle soreness, low morale and other physical and mental conditions that are common on long duration fire assignments, and serious safety repercussions could have been made not only on the ANF-Copco initial attack, but on any other subsequent initial attacks during the period of 8/18 to 8/19/12.

Futhermore,  forest fire management continues to not provide those personnel of 1614C with the adequate 2 days of rest needed to return to work in a safe manner, as deemed by the Incident Business Management Handbook and 'Red Book' documentation. Personnel are directed to return to work on 8/21/12 after only 1 day of R&R / Admin leave, and will as such not be sufficiently rested.

Fire management stated that those personnel from 1614C were being withheld from their days off due to the lack of availability of replacement resources on the forest for the following day shift (8/19), however resource availability on 8/19/12 was the same as it had been during the preceeding 2 week period while 1614C was off-forest.

It was also stated by fire management that it was forest policy for fire personnel to receive only 1 day off after 14, even though numerous ANF personnel have received 2 days after 14 during the 2012 and previous fire seasons and that statement would be in direct violation of 'Red Book' and Incident Business Management Handbook direction.","Field going personnel informed fire management that personnel assigned to 1614C had conducted 14 days of rigorous fire fighting duties and should received the appropriate rest. Fire management initially agreed, but later revoked that decision and witheld those personnel for extended shifts.

Lower level fire management officers attempted to give those personnel their mandated days off, however a higher level fire management officer overrode that decision and informed those personnel that they would work regardless of what the red book standards said.

Field going personnel have been unable to secure the appropriate 2 days of rest, despite our effots to obtain it. As such, our personnels safety is comprised should we be dispatched to an initial attack incident.","08/19/2012 00:00"

This person was evacuated from the fireline to the ICP. Ground support transported the crew member to the hospital located 12 miles from the ICP. The patient’s condition required overnight hospitalization.

On August 19th, similar environmental conditions existed and at approximately 0938, an engine crew member on the same Division experienced vomiting and heat exhaustion symptoms. The firefighter was evacuated from the fireline to the ICP. An ambulance transported the engine crew member to the hospital. The patient was released the same day.

Care and evacuation of all 3 cases followed the 9 step process outlined in Incident Response Pocket Guide (IRPG).","The Safety message on August 16th included a description of HRI symptoms. The morning briefing safety portion specifically mentioned drinking 4 bottles of water for every bottle of sports drink consumed.

On August 17th, the morning briefing safety discussion stressed the need to urinate. Lack of urination was explained as a sign that people were not drinking enough.

After the first firefighter succumbed to the heat on August 18th, a safety stand down took place on all Divisions of the fire.

On August 19th, the IC assisted in the Division break out (2 crews, 5 engines, and miscellaneous overhead) where the HRI occurred. He had people pinch their skin and he discussed “tenting” of the skin was an indication of advanced dehydration. The IC encouraged people to take frequent breaks and pace oneself in the heat. The Division break was concluded at 0800. As Safety Officer (SOF2), I accompanied the crew for the August 19th day shift that had lost 2 crew members to HRI. The crew and engine personnel working on the topographic bench and later staged for initial attack did not experience outward signs of heat HRI.

Mitigation measures of HRI discussed by Operations, Safety, and IC were:

1) Fireline supervisors need to assess the capability of resources.

2) Acclimation of personnel to the job.

3) Acclimation of personnel to the heat.

4) Stress to line personnel that an emphasis should be placed on water and electrolytes. Reduce or eliminate energy drinks and sodas.

5) Take structured hydration breaks - for example, have the crew take a break and all drink at the same time so everyone can monitor each other.

6) Break more often (a structured ratio of time worked vs. break time was not developed).

7) Whenever possible take advantage of shade.

8) Continue proper intake of food. Eat fruits and vegetables to replace nutrients, verses junk food and candy bars.

9) Explain to crewmembers to monitor their urine. Urine should be pale yellow. If urine is dark, you are behind the fluid intake curve. You should be urinating every 2 to 4 hours with adequate urine flow to indicate hydration.

10) It was stressed to crews that they need to look out for each other and bring to the attention of the crew leader anyone who appears to be suffering from signs of heat related illness.

11) The host unit should highlight use of EFF crews to the incoming IMT at the in-briefing.

Background of hand crew: Emergency firefighters (EFF) made up a portion of the hand crew and EFF’s were the ones who fell victim to HRI. Recommendation – identify in a severity request, individuals will be hired at least 24 hours prior to fireline duty so that personnel can acclimate and be assessed by fireline supervisors.

Eating Habits: Several of the individuals of the hand crew said they had not eaten (2 meals or less) prior to the shift. Extenuating circumstances affected this local crew that did not affect other crews. Some crew members did not want to eat because of the heat and a couple expressed concerns that they might get food poisoning because the lunches were in the heat all morning. The lack of nutrition may have contributed to the HRI symptoms. Recommendation – remind local resources that the fire assignment is their priority. All other issues are secondary. Eat perishable food items early in the shift.

Crews travelling to a fire generally are not drinking a lot of water during the drive. Recommendation - the team will treat all resources as though a hydration deficit condition exists.

Ensure fireline supervisors assess their personnel and make necessary adjustments. I spoke to the engine boss (ENGB) of the 3rd person who experienced HRI. The ENGB stated this individual was “not right” after briefing. Recommendation – clearly state and make fireline supervisors aware of their responsibility and if need be remove the individual or resource from the shift.","08/24/2012 00:00"

Our radio techs have invested a lot of time, energy and money to correct the problems. The main problem with this is frequent, almost weekly – and sometimes daily, failures at Masonic. This wouldn’t be so bad if it was just the one repeater, but several of our other repeaters for Bridgeport are linked to this one site, so when it goes down it cripples our ability to communicate not just fire traffic but with our other resource folks who are scattered all over the district on a daily basis, especially those who are working quite remotely in the Hoover Wilderness. It is a serious safety issue that haunts us every day. For example, on cloudy days, and just overnight, the solar panels batteries are unable to hold enough charge to support regular radio traffic, the generator does not come on when needed, or shuts down after a short time.

The district has missed fire tones due to the repeater not functioning correctly. Our radio techs and Fire Staff have tried several fixes to correct to solve the issue.","The Dispatch Center, district and radio techs have requested many tickets with CHD to have the issue re solved. We do have in place that our Dispatch can communicate with our fire resources and field units over the radio WAVE system. For fire tone outs when the repeater is functioning it works. But when there is a lot of radio traffic over the repeater at times the batteries cannot keep up. Between the dispatch center and the Duty Officer there is constant communication over the WAVE/ radios to install the safety of firefighters and district personnel. The WAVE only works for us, when our Fire Staff and /or the Duty Officer is listening from their computers and the field units then are directed by the Duty Officer. The Safe Net is to help facilitate the process of the radio techs getting the support they need to correct the issue.","08/17/2012 00:00"

The stock engine air cleaner has already been noticed as less than satisfactory at capturing dust in the environments that these vehicles operate in. The air filters are almost impossible to blow out with compressed air and keep operational out on the fireline. This isn't the most dangerous issue though.

The stock air box on the new model F-550 Type Six Fire Engines has a foam pre-filter that installs in the air box and hangs down the motor side of the air box in the engine compartment. It is completely uncovered and unprotected from sparks or flames. This foam pre-filter is highly flamable. In the case that flames or sparks did come into contact with this foam pre-filter an engine compartment fire is highly likely.

When changing this foam pre-filter a lighter was used to test it's flamability. With less than two seconds of direct flame contact from a lighter the foam pre-filter was burning and beginning to self consume. Although direct flame contact to this foam filter is potentially unlikely, these fire engines operate in an environment where the potential to submit the filter to direct flame contact or sparks is greatly increased.","A deficiency report has already been filed earlier in the year for the un-effectiveness of the air cleaner system on these trucks.

In attendance were myself, the NPS initial attack IC, and two NPS detailers.

The primary issue of concern is in regards to the lack of a dedicated fire dispatch and/or Law Enforcement frequency at Buffalo National River. MROCC is the name of the NPS dispatch office at Buffalo River. Currently the only dispatch channel available through MROCC is shared between all park divisions. There is regular daily traffic from fire, law enforcement, maintenance, resource management, and interpretation.

While on patrol on 8-15-12, NPS crews discovered and reported a smoke south of the NPS boundary, on Forest Service land. I instructed them to respond and dispatched the NPS helicopter for support. I also called the Forest Service and they requested that we continue our response and advised that they would also send resources.

During this response, the NPS initial attack crew experienced a high volume of radio traffic on the MROCC dispatch frequency from various sources while responding to the Iceledo fire. An active Law Enforcement investigation was occurring at Margaret White Bluff, where Park Rangers were involved in an operation which required a high volume of encrypted as well as un-encrypted traffic. I believe the dispatch log may show that MROCC and Park Rangers discussed the possibility of clearing the dispatch channel for LE use but MROCC dispatchers decided that communications were not being compromised for their LE operation. I feel this decision was appropriate and have no criticism of MROCC's current procedures. I only wish to emphasize that one shared dispatch frequency is a problem.

There was also routine radio traffic from the Maintenance Division, as well as traffic from the incoming US Forest Service resources inquiring about the location of fire.

The responding helicopter arrived over the fire providing assistance with water drops and reconnaissance. While this ship had its own air to ground tactical channel, it was difficult for ground resources to listen for the helicopter because of all the various traffic on the Buffalo repeaters and ground tacs. Scanning the MROCC dispatch channel in conjunction with the air and ground tactical channels was necessary for the IC in the early phases of the incident, to promote better situational awareness. As the incident progressed and stabilized, scanning of multiple channels eventually became unnecessary as radio traffic subsided.

In the early phases of the fire, the combined effects of high volume LE radio traffic, high volume fire traffic, helicopter operations, and two responding agencies attempting to locate and fight the fire all contributed to a difficult communication scenario for resources at the fire. This traffic interfered with the firefighter's ability to efficiently communicate with incoming NPS and USFS fire resources.

Another concern that came out of the AAR is that if there had been an injury on the fire (which was located in steep rugged terrain) there would have been 3 high priority incidents (initial attack, LE ops, and SAR) competing for the same dispatch frequency.

To summarize...

*** Fire and LE divisions need their own separate dedicated dispatch frequencies to enhance efficiency and promote safety during emergency operations.

*** Scanning of multiple channels (command, air to ground, and ground to ground) is often necessary in the early phases of an emerging incident. Turning the scan off is not a solution to the problem.

*** Conflict on the Buffalo repeaters may be of temporary or limited duration but creates a high level of risk/consequences.

*** Any additional unplanned event on the fire or elsewhere in the park would have created even more demand for an already over-taxed dispatch channel.","During the fire...

*** Prioritized fire transmissions on the dispatch channel and instructed other fire personnel to wait until transmissions were complete.

*** Deferred non-critical transmissions on the dispatch channel until non-fire traffic had subsided.

*** Attempted to use cell phones as much as possible but coverage was limited and unreliable.

*** Used ground to ground tactical channels as much as possible to corrdinate the incident response. This was useful only for 'line of sight' distances and was not practical until responders were in close proximity to the fire.

Other alternatives that were not attempted...

*** NPS resources could attempt to use the USFS repeater that is located south of the NPS boundary, but this repeater is typically out of range until resources are close enough. The closest repeater in this response was the Point Peter repeater, which is part of the NPS network. Initial responders from the NPS did not have an alternate dispatch frequency for the majority of the response.

After the fire...

*** I informed FMO and the MROCC dispatch supervisor of the situation and expressed my concerns. Both were very attentive to my concerns and open to discussing alternatives. The discussion is expected to continue, but the option of MROCC obtaining a second dispatch channel is in serious doubt at this time.","08/18/2012 00:00"

Fire behavior was intense, with multiple spot fires over control lines, noctural wind driven fire and intense ground and torching fire. The Divison (Divison 'Night PP')was made up of exclusively ODF resources with the exception of the NOAZ regs. All ODF were assigned to the incident and the divison was assigned a tactical frequency for operations. The ODF resources were using an ODF state frequency ('RED') for operations, which was not assigned to the incident or the the divison. None of the NOAZ regs had the frequency, nor were informed that ODF were using that frequency. The crew boss tried several times to raise the Division Supervisor on the assigned incident tactical channel with no response.

One was a type 4 and two were type 6s. One of the Type 6's was to give us a tour of this neighborhood, as he had been assigned to this area the day before.

At the sub-briefing, the type 6 engine boss that was familiar with the area, stated that said sub-division was an area that could not be safely navigated by Type 4's. The division supervisor said, 'Yeah, well, I'm gonna have these other two engines follow you up there,' ignoring the engine boss's comment about type 4's. One of the engine bosses then clarified that he knew one was a type 4 engine. Overhead said, 'Yeah, It'll be fine'.

Most of the time, Overhead drives smaller vehicles and may forget that these type 4's can weigh upwards of 25,000 lbs and carry several hundred gallons of water sloshing around. They are also much longer, wider, and taller.

The engines proceeded into the sub-division. This sub-division becomes very tight, and VERY steep, with one-lane dirt roads and extremely tight corners. There are no areas to pass other vehicles. They proceeded up the hill with the Type 6 first, then type 4, and following was the second type 6. Even though some of the turns of the road were extremely tight, all three engines had fairly short wheel bases and were able to manage until they came to the top of the hill.

At this point the first type 6 engine (the smaller one) had to make an 8 point turn to get around the tightest corner. This was the engine that knew the area and had been here before (whose comment was ingored ).

Only a couple of people live at the top of this hill past this point, using this road. It is a road that makes you wonder how they managed to get building materials up here to even build a house. We asked one of the citizens who was driving around on a quad how they had managed to build here. He stated that some of the building materials had to be air lifted to the site. He also stated that many of the citizens drive quads instead of regular vehicles, and that's why they don't bother widening the roads.

Then the type 4, having no other option but to back down a steep, narrow grade for a quarter mile, attempted to make the corner. Even with the backer helping him, he had to struggle.

The Type 4 driver was an experienced semi and heavy equipment driver, and at one point, came within 3 inches of a tree. The driver was within inches of dropping off of a 12 foot drop on one side and within inches of a citizens fence on the other side. At one point he had to go up an embankment, causing the truck to lean almost to the point of tipping over, just to get out of the spot. He kept going until he finally managed to get past this area. By the time he was done, he was sweating and needed to stop. He took a break to calm his nerves.

It was a great example of very professional driving in a high stress, emergency situation. Had the driver been less experienced, this situation would have probably become some kind of serious incident that may have injured someone, or worse.

This EQUIPMENT was not designed for these types of roads. The smaller Type 6's even had difficulty.

COMMUNICATIONS were not handled correctly. Ignoring an engine boss is a total break down in COMMUNICATIONS.

It was also negligent DECISION MAKING.

It was a poor example of LEADERSHIP. Not listening to the engine boss lead some of us to think we would not be listened to about other safety issues.

If the engine boss had been listened to, a proper RISK ASSESSMENT could have helped us avoid the incident.

Also observed: The majority of the firefighters on the CONTINGENCY division were not wearing hard hats and not chocking their wheels. Overhead were setting a poor example as they were not seen wearing hard hats even once on the fire line. The names of the individuals on this division who were directly responsible for these safety issues are:

The crew is comprised of members from the Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR). The crew was putting in saw line on the Little Creek Fire. Following MN DNR policy chainsaw operators are required to wear 'cut-resistant', safety toe boots. Faller on the crew is a MN DNR employee and was compliant with agency policy. Faller had been operating chainsaw for 2-3 hours and sustained injury to the tops of his feet/toes, due to the steep terrain and hard 'safety toe'. The hard safety toe rubbed the top of foot and removed all of the skin from the tops of his toes. From that point on faller had difficulty walking/hiking due to the injury.","Another incident occurred in which the faller was asked to assist with that allowed him to come off the line for 2 days. When faller returned to fireline, he was unable to wear the safety toe style boots and therefore was unable to perform as a FALB in compliance with MN DNR policy. Faller always brings a second pair of boots on assignment. These are NFPA 1977 approved fire boots, 'Red Book' compliant, and provide adequate support and comfort for hiking in steep terrain. As he was unable to perform as a FALB in compliance with MN DNR policy he swapped positions with another crew-member and therefore the crew lost a FALB position.

The boots in question were SwedePro Chainsaw Boots. The boots have Kevlar lining and a steel toe. Also, the boots are lined with synthetic material, which melts when exposed to direct heat. Whereas they meet 'ASTM F1818 Specification for Foot Protection for Chainsaw Users' they are questionable on the fireline, especially in steep terrain.

As it states in 'Boots on the Fireground: An Anaylsis of Interagency Wildland Firefighter Boot Standards' By Tom Lynch, Missoula Technology & Development Center, August 2008.

'Boots with metal toe shields are not generally recommended for firefighting because metal absorbs, retains, and retransmits heat.'

'A 2002 Canadian Study found that Wildland firefighters have a low instance of impact injuries to the feet and that boots with protective toe shields were more likely to create foot irritation and discomfort (Ault 2002)'

1230 Flathead IHC arrives at Headquarters, ID a Clearwater-Potlatch Timber Protection Association (CPTPA) station We were in-briefed by 2 logistics guys and received a radio clone. The logs guys led us to the fire. At 1400 we arrived at the parking area and parked the crew. Supt and foreman found CPTPA IC. IC briefed us on tactical duties. He had to be prompted for specifics on everything else. No EMS. No Wx. No Med plan other than “call the county”. No direct link to Grangeville dispatch. No mention of hazards. No direction other than, “jump in the middle and work south” no crew contacts other than “a guy named [X]”. IC was wearing jeans. We noticed multiple CPTPA people not wearing PPE or shelters. Supt told IC we would scout the fire before committing crew. Supt took off on a scouting mission down the burned line through the middle of the fire, as directed by IC. Foreman briefed crew. Crew established own LCES. We posted 1st lookout of day. Supt called and said to send no one down the burned line through the middle of the fire the IC had directed the crew to go down, due to snags and previously cut log decks. Line was still hot. As supt was hiking, he observed multiple cedar snags burning from half way up down to the base. Fire was more active than IC’s briefing indicated. Foreman scouted north line and met with supt. Both tied in with [X] (wearing jeans). Told [X] they had of lot of hazards. Snags-safety issues…he agreed. [X] told us about the tactics of skipping sections of line due to snags. Asked for a contact for the crew working from N to S. he said they didn’t have a contact. Just a hodge-podge crew. At that point, we had heard multiple people asking, “are you ok” after helicopter drops, the people directing the helicopter drops had no or little experience utilizing helicopters and were having the helicopters drop water without clearing the line of personnel. We scouted the bottom of the fire from N to S to assess what work had been done, what needed to be done and to assess hazards. Got down to the skipped section of line and noted that it was burning actively and needed attention. While scouting from N to S, we both  commented that we had huge concerns about the number of snags burning, the size of them and the amount that had already come down. During this scouting mission, we were both running side hill to get out of underneath of the snag hazards. Hiking was extremely difficult due to the amount of dead and down along with the steepness of the slope. At this time, we had already determined that the crew would not be engaging on the fire until the hazards were mitigated. We tied into another section of skipped line that was actively moving downhill. Another person standing close by was not wearing Nomex pants,  we commented to him about the snag hazards, skipping sections of line tactics, and active fire moving downhill and the possibility of fire hooking the made-up crew. We then told him to call a helicopter to drop on the skipped sections line where no personnel were working, to halt fire spread and reduce chance of fire moving and hooking the crew. He did not respond. We proceed on side hill to tie in with the hodge-podge crew. When we got there, we found a bunch of CPTPA folks with no PPE and running saws without chaps, mixed in with a USFS engine crew from the NFRD. We talked to the FS ENGB and expressed our concerns about snags, tactics, and safety concerns. He said he did not know who was in charge, if the IC is a real IC and did not know what their plan was. He said he has been, “Trying to help these guys out and keep his guys safe.” At this point, everyone on the fire seemed to be task focused and mission driven. The only objective was to complete the handline. No one had an eye on the big picture or seemed to be in control or in charge. We told the FS ENGB what is going on here is extremely unsafe. We were not going to engage our crew and that as USFS employees we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard. FS ENGB agreed and said snags and communication had been an issue all day. We proceeded and ran in to CPTPA guy named [A]. We voiced our concerns about snags, tactics, commo and putting a helicopter on the sections that had gotten skipped. He said, “we are just doing the best we can with what we got…”. He asked us to put our crew on the skipped sections and we told him we were not bringing the crew down. We advised him to hit them with a helicopter. We proceeded south to the farthest south and bottom corner of the fire and found it burning actively in a drainage filled with heavy dead and down and a receptive bed of fine fuel underneath. At this point we could see the prison crew digging line downhill into this drainage with fire below them. We told [A] to get a helicopter drop on this area and he did not. We hustled up the line and tied into the prison crew overhead and informed them of what was going on below them. This didn’t seem to concern them. Their concern was the falling snags and rolling rocks coming down the hill. The prison crew's CRWB commented that they had been chased up the hill several times due to fire below them and big rocks coming down the hill. At this time a huge snag came down above us and started rolling down through the standing trees. The prison CRWB commented, “That is the sound of the day”. We once again called [A] and told him to get buckets on the fire below the prison crew because it was hooking them. We didn’t get a response. At this time, we continued uphill 100ft and then someone made the call to get everyone out due to the bucket drops. The prison crew started to leave the fire line. The fire was still moving up hill and into more dead and down. My crew-mate contacted air attack and requested a bucket drop on the heat; air attack gave him 2 helicopters. He started working them on the spot. Another member of the IHC met up with the FS ENGB and his crew heading up hill to get off the fire line. FS ENGB said he talked to [A] about the LCES, snag hazards, medevac spots and [A] said once again, “we are doing the best with what we have” FS ENGB grabbed his crew of USFS people and hiked off the line. Our IHC member informed air attack to have the helicopters keep dropping on the spots and we both bugged out. We started hiking out when we soon ran into the prison crew and some CPTPA people (again with NO PPE, fire shelter, Nomex). The prison crew commented they were slow due to injured persons on the crew. We made our way to the road on top of the fire out of harm’s way, sat down and started compiling a list of broken 10 & 18, safety concerns, and ways to mitigate them. We walked down the road to where a group of CPTPA guys and the IC were gathered. We stood beside the IC and were ignored awkwardly for 10 minutes. We initiated conversation and told him we would not engage the crew because we have standards and protocols we need to follow. He said he would just have to send us home then. We said that was fine. We told him we had a list of safety concerns and mitigations if he would like to hear them. We read him our list and he said they have a different set of values and do things differently. He asked to keep the list and we tore it from the notebook and gave it to him. We told him we would contact Grangeville dispatch after we had been released. We drove to Headquarters and called dispatch.

During bucking the fuel cap came off and soaked the chaps of the firefighter, then ignited causing the full length of the chaps to be engulfed with flames. With the assistance of another firefighter they removed the chaps and extinguished the flames without injury. The saw was also engulfed which was easily extinguished with dirt.

The Stihl MS-440 chainsaws are equipped with tool-less fuel and bar oil caps, which are prone to not locking properly if not started in the correct position. If this happens the sawyer will pick up the saw in the right handed position (proper position) and soak their legs with either bar oil or fuel. Due to the thickness of the chaps it is difficult to notice this happening. During fueling you must ensure the caps are fully locked down in the right position and secured. Also if fuel or bar oil is spilled on the saw during refueling be sure to wipe away excess or let fuel evaporate before starting chainsaw again.","Talked with personnel about the fuel/oil caps and what to do in similar situations.","08/13/2012 00:00"

While inspecting my pump I noticed there was little fuel in the fuel pump, so the next step I took was to let more fuel in the fuel pump once I did that my pump ran fine until 30 minutes later. I looked at my fuel gauge and it was a 1/4 until empty. I went to look at my pump again and the fuel pump was full so I knew that wasn't the problem. I had 5 gallons of extra diesel on top of my engine so I put that into the fuel tank and it raised the level up went back out fired my pump and the pump fired right up. After our burn out was over I called another engine captain who has the same engine and told him about my problem, He also had been having the same issues. That engine captain did the same things as I did to correct the problem. When I got back to the sation I let my engine get down to 1/4 tank and tried to fire my pump and it would not start until I put more diesel into the tank.

Messages were relayed to helibase that Crew 1 was the top priority for water delivery. Messages were relayed by DIVS and Crew 2 to helibase direct on air to ground on three occasions stating crew 1 was priority for water/food delivery. According to Crew 1, back haul missions and other water deliveries were made before Crew 1's water delivery. SOFR questioned Air Operations, and Helibase Manager manager regarding the issue of water delivery to Crew 1.

Helibase made a decision to fly other missions without coordination with Operations or DIVS prior to supplying Crew 1 with food and water. Helibase stated they did not receive a call stating who the priority crew was for delivering food and water.

The issue is safety of Crew 1 being without water while other non-priority missions were flown.","Helicopter Managers were reminded to stick with the priority missions, and if there needed to be changes to expedite missions, that should be coordinated with Operations. Helibase should consider keeping a log with the radio operator to document orders from Operations or Divisions. A reminder was also given to Operations and Helibase to follow the chain of command regarding ordering, issues and re-prioritization.

Following is a summary of the incident, investigation on the cause,and corrective actions.

On August 5, 2012, three crews were shuttled on the mountain to suppress the Del Fire. The decision was made in late morning that the crews would spike out on the hill for the night, and their gear would be slung to them by helicopter before the end of the day. After the first two crews were shuttled in, helicopters began bucket work on the east side of the fire. At approximately noon, the third crew was shuttled to the hill. Air attack was instructed to relay to helibase that the crew gear was to be slung to each crew at a spot near their locations, and to contact the crews for the coordinates of their sling locations. Air attack relayed to helibase those instructions, and continued directing the helicopters on bucket missions. There were two Type 2 helicopters assigned to the Del Fire.

Late in the afternoon, helibase began sending loads of gear up the hill for one crew. Plans were made to send dinner to the crews on the line as well. One crew received their gear, but the other two crews did not receive gear. One crew received a sling load of water and food for the night.

Helibase informed Operations at approximately 1830 that no more sling missions would take place due to pilot duty hours being met, and some mechanical problems with one of the helicopters. A Type 3 Helicopter was coming to Alamo to complete a re-con mission with operations. The request was made to the Type 3 helicopter if they could assist with the sling missions. They had 1.1 hours of flight time left, and indicated they would fly one sling mission after the re-con flight. Discussions between the Type 3 Helicopter Manager and the Helibase Manager in Alamo resulted in a decision to cancel the re-con flight, and send the Type 3 Helicopter to Del Helibase to assist with sling missions. The Type 3 Helicopter flew to Del Helibase, and after finding that the sling loads were not built for their payload, determined to head back to Lincoln County Airport prior to timing out with the pilot flight hours. They completed no sling loads. The Type 3 Helicopter Manager indicated that the missions were not clear, and there was not time to complete the mission. The Helibase Manager indicated that air attack informed them that the Type 3 Helicopter would be completing the sling mission; however, that was not relayed to the Type 3 Helicopter.

The IC called the Duty Officer and requested a helicopter to help with the sling loads before the day and “pumpkin time” was over. A different Type 3 Helicopter was sent from another fire to Del Helibase to assist with the sling loads. Operations contacted the Helibase Manager and informed him a Type 3 helicopter was coming to the helibase for a sling load and to have a sling ready to go on the hill. Del Helibase was contacted by the incoming Type 3 Helicopter approximately 15 minutes before their arrival, but communications were scratchy, causing helibase to request that the helicopter call when they got closer. The incoming Type 3 helicopter contacted helibase later and described the allowable payload, and helibase had a belly hook sling ready to go when they arrived. The type 3 helicopter hauled the sling to one crew, flew back to Del Helibase, picked up two helitack crew members and flew to Alamo, landing just prior to or at “pumpkin time”.

The IC, SOFR, and Helitack discussed the issues to determine why the crews did not get the gear delivered to them before the helicopters timed out for the day. Helibase Manager explained that mechanical breakdowns occurred, and air attack was using the helicopters for bucket work, and would not release them for gear shuttle. Communication to helibase was only by air attack, and the helibase manager assumed that Operations was coordinating with air attack on those decisions. Air attack was using the helicopters for buckets, and when the helibase asked to use them for cargo shuttle, air attack kept the helicopter working buckets longer than expected. One helicopter also had mechanical issues that hindered the cargo haul operations.

This caused a safety concern for the crews without overnight gear. The 2:1 work/rest guidelines were broke, and one crew was with minimal water throughout the night.","The IC, SOFR, and Helitack discussed the issues to determine why the crews did not get the gear delivered to them before the helicopters timed out for the day.

The IC and SOFR explained to the helitack that cargo and food for crews took priority over bucket drops, and that the helibase should have let air attack know there was cargo that needed to make it on the hill before the end of shift. It was also pointed out that Operations should have been informed much earlier that the cargo would not make it to the crews before end of shift. Helibase was also informed that they should contact air attack and remind them of the cargo missions, especially when air attack transitioned to a new plane.

Helibase was directed that all future missions to support crews would take priority over bucket work. Helibase manager offered to act as Air Operations for the next day to improve communications. Recommendations were made to the Operations to stay in communication with helibase and air attack to ensure crews get their logistical support. Helibase was also reminded to contact Operations if it was getting late, and cargo still needed to be flown on the hill so a decision could be made on whether to hike crews off the hill or get another helicopter. Other actions were reminding helibase that when crews are on the hill and there is an expectation that they will get their gear to remain overnight. If issues are causing delays, and the expectation cannot be met, communication needs to be relayed to Operations as soon as possible. All crews and helibase should consider personnel safety first and foremost over bucket work.

Logistical support for crews would be the top priority for the next shift.","08/08/2012 00:00"

I have been asked to lock all vehicles during normal working hours to satisfy this inspection. I am responsible for one command vehicle and two type 4 heavy engines that respond to initial attack fires from the BOD yard.

Locking these vehicles is not our normal protocol...nor should it be. During working hours, I have a 2 minute response time to respond to an incident; it is not feasible to unlock all doors (and MANY bins on the engines) and still achieve that response time. Additionally, the last thing that should be on my mind during an initial attack call is unlocking our equipment; that should be done first thing in the morning during preventative maintenance checks.

Furthermore, if unlocking a bin door is missed prior to our response, the result could compromise crewmember safety if a needed item cannot be reached quickly during time-critical arrival. For example, if an engine is asked to quickly back-fire a road and the drip-torch bin is accidentally still locked, the engine could be stalled just long enough to lose the opportunity to hold the road or have to pull back from a compromised position. The crews avoid these situations by taking adequate time each morning to ensure their equipment and their personal readiness is maintained.","","08/02/2012 00:00"

Secondly, in the event that bins do not get unlocked before leaving to an incident, once at the incident major risks and problems may occur. For instance, crew members will not be able to get to their PPE, tools, water, hose, or burning apparatus in time of quick use without having to shut the truck off to get the keys to unlock the bins.","Concerns were brought up in Thursday meeting about the complications having a locked fire engine during working hours would cause and it was shot down because unlocked vehicles would ding us on the review.","08/02/2012 00:00"

This decision hinders our fire readiness and response time to a wildland fire. Our current Boise District Standard of Operations guide, expects us as wildland firefighters to response to a wildland fire from our station during duty hours, within 2 minutes. By locking the apparatus, it causes a great delay, confusion, and safety hazard to run around the apparatus and assure that every compartment is unlock before leaving our duty station, thus hindering our Standard of Operations response time. Furthermore, by locking the fire apparatus and it's compartments during duty hours, does not initially guarantee that every individual compartment will be completely unlocked during fire suppression tactics which contributes to a serious safety and life threatening concern for my crew members and I.","To correct this unsafe practice, I have decided to continue to keep my fire apparatus and all compartments unlocked during our hours of operation for the sake of our safety!","08/02/2012 00:00"

On the Cle Ellum, assistant supervisors are tasked with pack test administration of their supervisor with the expectation they will pass. On the Tonasket most firefighters are held to the standard, while a select few are given pack tests in secret with no accountability. Or even worse  the pack test form is signed off with no test ever given. I believe that if anyone is required to pack test to get a red card or keep a red card, that everyone wanting that card should be held to that standard. Not the case in Tonasket, a manager stripped one assistant captain of their red card after repeated unsuccessful attempts, and then just signed off on another person who never even gave it a legitimate attempt.

The radio in the engine developed a problem of continually having an open mike causing communication to sieze due to the radio transmitting constantly.  This not only became a hazard to the engine crew but to other initial attack resources and dispatch as well since it tied up the radio frequency it was on (the local forest repeater channel).  The problem persisted for several weeks until a short term replacement could be located (off of an unused patrol truck). Until the short term radio was located, we were required to utilize handheld radios during day to day operations as well as during emergency responses.  This led to several communication barriers such as compromised situational awareness.<br/><br/>The original radio was then sent off and a ticket was submitted for repair by mid August (CHD incident #121002-001220).  The Captain of the engine repeatedly contacted the computer help desk to check on the status of the radio with no reply back to him.  We still have not had a response to the request for radio repair and are in need of a mobile radio as it is a vital part of our safety and communications equipement required to be on a fire engine at all times and in good working order. <br/><br/>It is now coming up to the beginning of the next fire season and we have a loaner radio while another fire vehicle (patrol truck), does not have a radio since we are utilizing it.  This is an unacceptable scenario as we work in a environment that requires constant communication via radio.<br/><br/>Another note on this is that our utility truck recently started having the same radio issues (same type of radio...a BK DMH digital radio). We are hesitant to send it in for repair as it has been 6 months since we turned in our engine radio with no replacement or even notification on what is going on. The radio in the utility was placed into service the same time that the engine radio was, which is somewhat indicating the possibility of a bad batch of radios that need to be replaced or repaired as soon as possible.","We took the radio out of a spare, unused patrol truck, to place into the engine as it was a direct replacement (only meant for a short-term solution).

I understand the importance of our security with facilities and equipment. I have been told to lock my engine cab and all been doors during normal working hours. First of all the main gates to the compound are open daily during business hours. Second, BLM and Forest Service gates are on different schedules when open and both share the facility areas; furthermore most buildings are unlocked during business hours. Locking my engine is not normal protocol and should not be done just to pass inspection. During the start of working hours I have my engine personnel perform preventative maintenance checks. At this time the engine cab/bins are unlocked and engine is put into a state of readiness for initial attack.

I feel having to unlock the cab/bin doors during fire calls will hinder my ability to retrieve important dispatch information about the fire. My situational awareness will be less and the safety of my crew could be compromised if certain information is missed. As protocol for my engine I will not ask my crew to lock the engine during our working hours of initial attack. I also ask this of my management.","","08/02/2012 00:00"

A strike occurred on the West slope of the valley overlooking the camp. During the event, an apparent surge traveled from the ground strike to a power pole placed at south end of the camp. From a witness account sparks could be seen following the power line from this pole to a power pole located near the center of the camp. Upon reaching the second pole sparks were observed coming from the attached transformer.

Three near misses and several incidents of property damage were reported. One individual, who had parked his pickup near a power pole on south end of the camp, observed static electricity sparking between metal parts of the vehicles tailgate. Shortly before a large flash occurred he reacted by moving away from the vehicle. He was not injured.

Another individual who had been leaning on a truck several yards away from the pole near the center of the camp, report feeling tingling in his left arm. The effect knocked him to his knees, and caused him to feel disoriented for a moment. The individual was examined by medical unit, who did not find any residual effects. The individual was re-examined the following morning. Other then mild soreness the individual was found to be okay.

A third person was slightly shocked by static electricity when picking up a telephone receiver.

The incidents of potential and actual property damage consisted of a lap top computer, a pickups electrical system, and a cordless telephone. The lap top suffered a systems malfunction. This was correctable, after the battery and other systems were reset. The surge of static electricity may have temporarily shorted out components of a pickups electrical system. All the programmed radio stations had been lost, and a fuel systems malfunction indicator had been activated. The cordless telephone stopped working, and could not be reactivated.","Lessons Learned disseminated to incident Personnel:

Emphasis on situational Awareness being as important in camp environment as it is on the fire line. All personnel in camp should be briefed on the IRPG guidelines for thunderstorms, page 19.

Prior to arrival of a storm all electrical devices, particularly computer hardware, should be disconnected even if connected to surge protectors.

Radio transmissions from both District offices and other vehicles was received and understood by crews.

It was suggested to crews that they identify, to Allegheny Dispatch, what channel or repeater they were calling in on so that the dispatcher could transmit back out on the correct channel or repeater. This was done as requested with no change in the poor communications.

This has been an ongoing issue on this forest and notification was made to the radio tech back during spring fire season. Some work was done to the Dispatch console in the Supervisor's Office, but this did not fix the issue.

We have had multiple incidents where we have had to pull off the fireline because of the exhaust filter filling up and putting our engine into a reduced power mode. If the exhaust filter is not cleaned by driving at highway speeds then the engine will go into an idle only mode. This has happened to us on multiple different fires since the first time it happened in July. It is happening more frequently since the problem first started. This problem occurs when we are mopping up or supporting a hose lay and the engine is either idling or operating at low rates of speed. The truck is designed to perform a regen and clean out the exhaust filter by itself, but it only does this when the truck is driving at highway speeds for an extended period of time. This has become a major safety concern for us because we are often a long ways away from a highway to be able to perform the regen. Our major safety concerns with this is that it will completely shut down on us while we are doing initial attack, or supporting crews on a burn out. It could not only put us in a bad situation but also other firefighters if our truck shuts down or we have to pull off the line to go drive down a highway in order for the exhaust filter to clean itself out. This puts not only us at risk of being in a bad situation but it also could make so that we burn up a brand new engine.

We have gone and talked to the Ford dealership and a local diesel mechanic shop and have figured out a way to mitigate this safety issue because of an exemption for emergency vehicles. We have not been able to get it fixed yet because we have been waiting for approval. The fix that was suggested from the equipment group is not possible to do, both the Ford dealership and the local diesel shop have told us that.","","08/22/2012 00:00"

UCR picked up 26 new IA today 7/21 with several more unstaffed fires.

The winds were estimated to be 45 MPH plus. During the event, two large food unit dining tents, along with their frames, were tore from their tie downs. The tents, which are 20 X 40 feet in dimension and weigh ~400 lb each, went airborne and were carried by the wind for a considerable distance. One stopped when it collided with a wash station trailer that was approximately 40 feet away. The second flew approximately 200 feet and landed on a shower unit.

While airborne, the second tent was lifted over the top of a 15 foot tall salad bar/drink tent; a wash station trailer and a pickup truck. As it descended, it was stopped by the shower unit trailer.

There were approximately 60 plus personnel in the vicinity of the camp at the time of this incident. No injuries occurred. But a near miss was recorded on video being taken by the camp manager. The video shows an individual sitting on the tailgate of the pickup truck that was in the flight path of the second tent. Due the location of the truck, this individual could not see the tent until it had cleared the top of the salad bar/drink tent. By the time he’d realized what was coming at him, the tent was already passing over his pickup. The video made it appear the one of the flailing tent frame poles may have only missed hitting the individual by inches.

At the same time a tent at the incident helicopter base was also being torn from its tie downs. There was one injury that resulted from this incident. One of the helicopter base personnel received a superficial cut on his hand when a section of the tent frame penetrated the side window of the vehicle which he took shelter.","Lessons Learned and disseminated to incident personnel:

Situational Awareness is as important in the camp environment as it is on the fire line. In the future when thunder storm cells are approaching or are in the near vicinity of a base or spike camp, the same alerts being issued to line personnel should be communicated to camp personnel. If alerts are issued camp personnel should initiate immediate action to secure all loose materials, check that tent tie downs are firm and secure, and tent doors and windows are closed before the cell reaches the area.

Potential Mitigation:

During camp layout, if a combination of tents and trailers are being used, consideration could be given to orienting hard side trailers so they might function as wind breaks for the tents.","07/30/2012 00:00"

This was due to the way in which the units from the Los Padres had their radios programmed. More than one year ago, Cal Fire gave notice to Los Padres National Forest Fire units that they were going to program a tone guard into their Tactical simplex frequencies. This information was passed up through the chain of command by myself, and was eventually evaluated by our Chief Officers group and agency radio technicians. We were later informed via chain of command, that under no circumstances should we program RX tones into our radios. Therefore, we were unable to hear Div R when she was calling us on the radio, likewise, she was unable to hear us. Another Los Padres Firefighter working on our division, recognized that radio communications between Los Padres employees and Div R were not taking place, and contacted us on crew net to let us know that she was trying to reach us. I walked up the line to her location, conducted a quick test with my radio, and determined what the problem was. Because I had my radio programmed correctly in a different group, I was able to successfully communicate with her after that point. I then met with the other Los Padres Crew working in our area, and assisted them with programming their radios correctly.","First action was to re program radios for other Los Padres Unit in our Area on the fire.

Second action was to follow up with other Los Padres Units working on the incident to see if they had the same problem. One of the Los Padres Firefighters assigned to another division as a Strike Team Leader, reported having the same problem.

Third action taken was to reprogram all radios assigned to my Engine.

Fourth action, File Safenet

Fifth Action, follow up with Radio Techs to make sure all Radios on the Los Padres get programmed correctly.","07/18/2012 00:00"

At our in-briefing we cloned our handheld Bendix King radios with the local communications group. I attempted to figure out how to field program our mobile Vertex radio and was unsuccessful. I looked through multiple instruction manuals from the Vertex website and could not find any way to field program.

On our first day of forest patrol we discovered how large and mountainous the area was and with only three FS repeaters set-up there was little to no ability to contact or hear Ft. Collins Dispatch with a handheld King radio.

When we returned to the district and I was able to speak with the engine crew from our home unit who were still there I asked them how communications had been. I was told '...it's the worst I've ever seen. We can't hear anything. Even if we were dispatched we wouldn't have gotten it.' I asked the local unit engines about it and they said they could 'never get those guys,' meaning they were often unable to contact our other engine crew on their handhelds in the field from a remote site (since the mobile Vertex was unprogrammed and, therefore, useless).","I contacted the local forest communications tech. He called Region 6 to check and see if there was any way to field program the Vertex mobile radios. He relayed to me that he was told there was no way to field program the Vertex mobile. It was necessary to take it to someone who had the correct programming software for that type of radio and who knew how to do it to program it.

He attempted to program it himself, but did not have the correct programming mechanisms since Region 2 does not use any Vertex radios. I contacted a local private communications shop and the individual there also said he was unsure whether he could program a Vertex.

Finally, I simply has the local FS communications tech remove the Vertex mobile from our engine and install a Bendix King mobile radio with the correct local programming. Even with the mobile there were times on that forest where communications were difficult. I cannot imagine trying to use a handheld there for two weeks.

On a side not, I have worked for the FS in Region 6 for 7 years and am very familiar with the Vertex radios and have hand-programmed many handhelds. There has never been a single project fire assignment I have been to in-region or out-of-region that has had a communications unit able to clone or deal with the Vertex in any way whatsoever.

The fact that you cannot field-program the mobiles negates their use competely when away from a home unit and that is a violation of every communications directive in wildland fire and makes them an eminent safety issue.","08/04/2012 00:00"

Introduction:

On June 29, 2012 I  was dispatched, as a single resource HECM, to the Gila National Forest Helitack Crew, based out of the Grant County Airport.

The Gila Helitack Crew, including myself, and Helicopter 305 was reassigned on July 12, 2012 to the Tonto National Forest (TNF) to support multiple new fires burning on the TNF.

Main Text:

On July 13, 2012 Heli 305 and crew was tasked with crew shuttles from Pleasant Valley Helibase (near Young, AZ) to H2 near the “Aztec Fire.” I did not participate in the morning crew shuttle operation but was informed, at about noon, that myself, Heli manager and Gila Helitack member would assist in the evening crew shuttle from H2 to P. Valley Helibase.

At approx. 1650 (7/13/12) pilot, manager, crewmember and myself began loading Heli 305 with our line gear and tools to commence with the crew shuttle from H2 to P. Valley Helibase.

At approx. 1715 fire dispatch ordered Heli 305 to begin bucket work on the “Salome Fire,” approx. eight miles from H6 (on the shore of Theodore Roosevet Lake) instead of beginning crew shuttles as originally planned.

At approx. 1815-1830 Heli 305, finished with above mentioned bucket work, fueled and lifted off H6 with pilot, manager, crewmember and myself enroute to H2 to assist Heli 355 with crew shuttles from H2 to Pleasant Valley Helibase.

At approx. 1830-1845 crewmember and myself deboarded Heli 305 and began to manifest and load firefighters into Heli 305 bound for P. Valley HB. Immediately after Heli 305 lifted and flew away crewmember and I began discussing and realizing that we would not have enough time to complete the crew shuttle before Heli fights would be shut down-“pumpkin time”-2005

At approx. 1915 Air attack above began radio traffic regarding the fast approaching pumpkin time.

At approx. 1945 air attack radioed to Heli 355 to begin doing shuttles to a livestock corral just below H2 in order to get everyone off of H2 before pumpkin time. Heli 305 had since desisted fights do to the pumpkin time restriction.

At approx. 2000 ten firefighters, which included crewmember and myself, were safe and sound at what was referred to as the Ellison Ranch. Immediately, crewmember and myself began looking for shelter with what little light was left in the day.

At approx. 2015 our group at the Ellison Ranch was informed via radio that P. Valley Ranger Station was going to send two vehicle to pick us up and bring us hot meals. The drive time, one way, was going to be minimum two hours.

At approx. 2245 a “buggy carrier” (or something with a similar name) and a pickup truck arrived at the Ellison Ranch with hot food. Food was passed out and we ate as we were driven back to Pleasant Valley. The ride was and exciting and somewhat stressful ride-due to the rough road and the speed at which we were traveling. The 203 road we were traveling over was a very, very narrow, windy (lots of turns, not breezy), dirt and gravel road with cliffs and steep hillsides beneath the road that, in the event of an accident/rollover, injury or death would be certain and unavoidable. The 203 road constituted about three quarters of the drive time from to P. Valley.

At approx. 0100 July 14, 2012 we all arrived safely at the P. Valley R. Station.

Before going to sleep that night I began to realize that I had participated in a very serious Watchout situation. How long had our driver been on duty that day? The next morning I asked. I was told that our driver  had been on duty on July 13, 2012 since 0600. He clocked out at 1900, and must have come on again, to drive, no later than 2030.

My questions, comment and concerns are as follows:

Why have a driver(s) push past the 16 hour duty day threshold, while driving difficult mountain roads? Are MVO accidents the number one killer of WLFFs?... especially when darkness, fatigue, and a sense of urgency are present.

Was some sort of risk management assessment (Such as a GAR Model) performed before sending vehicles into the night for 4-5 hour round trip?

Why didn’t we just camp out over night at the Ellison Ranch? Even if all ten folks weren’t prepared, the vehicles could have brought out the necessary camping supplies and hot food, camped with us, then drove out the following morning.

Why didn’t dispatch, overhead, or whoever was responsible for organizing the evening crew shuttle use the time it took to do the morning crew shuttle and allow for the same amount of time (with a little more time built in for emergencies) to do the evening crew shuttle. If this info is needed, every helicopter manager worth his/her salt can provide this info—including flight times, fuel cycle considerations, and contingency plans if plan A goes wrong.

In Sum:

I would like to commend the Pleasant Valley Ranger Station employees for their exceptional generosity, hospitality, and professionalism. I felt like we were treated very well. However, whomever or whoever made the decision to send a driver into the night, knowing that he would be driving into his 18th hour, needs to consider an alternate plan if this situation, or a similar one, arises again in the future. Putting WLFFs at risk like this is unacceptable and should never happen again. I would like to see the fire world in general start walking the talk of safety, and putting human lives first.

Thank you for your time.","Without the advantage of hindsight I didn't fully grasp the gravity of the risk that I was involved in. I didn't know how long the driver of the vehicle i was riding had been on duty the day of July 13, 2012.","07/19/2012 00:00"

This storm cut power to the town of Big Piney, including the Big Piney Ranger District Office. This district office provides the communication link between the southern repeaters on the Bridger-Teton National Forest and Teton Interagency Dispatch Center. With power cut to the district office and no back-up power source, radio communication between the south end of the Forest and the dispatch center was impossible.

This power outage impacted radio communications for four of the six districts on the Forest. At that time, three aircraft were attempting to flight follow with the dispatch center; one Forest engine and several county engines were responding to multiple smoke reports; and each district had non-fire employees in the field.

Two days later, on July 13, a fiber optic cable providing internet service to Western Wyoming was cut. Once again, the communication link to the dispatch center was cut, with additional impacts given that the dispatch center landlines work on VOIP technology. Fortunately internet service was restored rapidly.

These back-to-back incidents shout the need for redundancy in power supply for the radio link between the southern repeaters and dispatch and the fallability of T1 line-reliant radio systems.","Local resources were able to mitigate the immediate safety concerns by relaying radio traffic to dispatch by phone and having the Fontenelle Fire (WY-BTF-0006) communications unit respond to traffic on the one repeater they were monitoring. The Fontenelle Fire's COML was also able to assist the local unit's radio technician in repairing lightning damage to this repeater. All resources were safely tracked through the end of their shift. Plans were made for using a combination of satellite phones and the adjoining BLM unit's repeaters and dispatch center for the following day, however power was restored before that became necessary.","07/24/2012 00:00"

Captain and firefighter were out side fighting the fire and the assignment was to keep the fire from crossing the road. Using the passenger side of the engine both firefighters were engaged using 1 1/2' hose. Flame height was approximately 3 to 7 feet. Engineer would not progress when asked to do so by Captain. Engineer,  on numerous occassions, previous fires, would be doing other things like talking on the radio, texting on phone, and the like instead doing the primary job of driving the engine and watching out for firefighter safety. Engineer was counseled on a previous fire about staying in the engine on the Kinyon Road Fire the previous week because he was getting out of the engine and making personal phone calls while in intial attack mode. Because the Engineer would not progress both firefighters were taking on extra heat and smoke because they wern't able to cool the flare ups due to no movement of the engine. Captain banged on the door numerous times to get the attention of the engineer. Very little progression again did not happen. When the Captain switched out with the firefighter on the hose the Captain asked the firefighter to tie in with engineer to find out why he wasn't progressing and that we were taking on a lot of smoke and heat due to no progression and the fires flare ups. At this time Engineer started progressing but wasn't paying attention to the 'circle of safety' of said personell on passenger side of the engine. Engineer did not have both firefighters in view and at that time the engine was in front of both firefighters. The engineer due to his inattention then ran over the charged 1 1/2' hose which then ripped it out of the piping and the 1 1/2' ball valve under pressure came back and hit Captain in the head. Captain was wearing his helmet at the time and no injury occured except shock due to the hit. Other firefighter received second degree burn injuries to face (nose and ear). While firefighter was fighting fire he tried to cover his face with proper safety equipment (Face shroud) which failed and fell out of his helmet. Engineer proceeded to get out of the engine again after incident while there was extreme fire activity to check out damage of Engine. The engine was still sitting where the flames were and the engine was unable at that time to deliver any water due to the damage of the truck. The Engineer got out a third time because he had misplaced his radio and was gone several minutes looking for it. He did not ask permission at any time to get out of the truck to do any of these things. Traffic was also still flowing because the highway was not shut down at this time and there were also numerous fire personeel from other agencies driving on highway as well. The Engine was still in danger due to fire activity and low visiblity due to smoke. Captain found Engineers radio inside of truck. At the third occurence of Engineer leaving the truck, Captain did not have any communication with Engineer. Captain advised Engineer not to get out of the truck and then directed him to move out of the fire activity area. Firefighter recieved second degree burns and Captain sustained smoke inhalation. Both firefighters decided to be treated at a later time.","Spoke with individual about the unsafe acts that occurred. Engineer did not take resposibility for his actions. I talked to him about the importance of getting side tracked and that his primary duty was to drive the engine and the promotion of 'FIREFIGHTER SAFETY'. That all other things occurring can wait like talking on the radio or being on his phone or getting out of the truck when we are in intial attack and his attentiveness is required. Talked to him disobeying a command from a supervisor. There was no remorse or apologies to any of the injuried or almost injured firefighters or any responsibility taken for his actions. Engineer was asked why he was not paying attention to the circle of safety of the firefighters. He did not have a reason for this.

The first item that was noted is the AA battery Clamshells on 2 radios would not stay engaged on the radio causing loss of power. The radios could not be issued and were placed out of service. On further examination the clamshells were of 2 different designs both had the same Motorola part numbers on them. The design that failed had a single plastic tab in the center of the clamshell that engaged the radio to hold the battery pack on the radio. The tab was worn down and did not connect securely. The other design had 3 tabs across the clamshell and were not a problem and were not worn as much. Attached are photos of each.

The second issue came up that the Datron radios were not scanning correctly and firefighters reported were not hearing the channels in the scan list. Not being able to monitor ajoining resources is a problem ( Standard Fire Order # 7), not being in contact with crew members is a problem ( Watch out situation # 7)

Further examination revealed that the ABC toggle switch settings were the problem. Looking at the attached Daton pocket card published by NIFC NIRSC. Postion C is shown as SCAN OFF. Position B is shown as SCAN ON. Postion A is shown as PRI SCAN ON. Looking at the programming from the front panel the actual functioning of the ABC toggle switch is Position C Scan Off PRI OFF, Position B Scan ON PRI OFF, Position A SCAN OFF PRI on. The radio does not scan in Position A it only monitors the selected chanel and the user programmed PRI channel. Positon A is labeled as PRI SCAN causing the user to believe that they are still scanning the scan list they entered which is not the case. From the front keypad programming the user can change the Toggle switch position A to SCAN ON PRI ON if they can find it without any documentation, but as soon as the toggle switch is moved from position A the radio reverts to the SCAN OFF PRI On mode . This caused us to advise users to not use the scan or priority function","Examined the fit of battey packs and removed loose units from service once the problem was identified.

Datron Radios as issued by NIFC have to be hand programmed to set them up. We are not issued the software to programme the radio's with a PC. There are some necessary functions which must be programmed by the software which can not be done by hand programming (specifics provided if needed). Example: There are 17 seperate key punches necessary to prepare to change a tone for a channel guard. You then have to scroll through the drop down menu and pick the tone you need, (up to 16 more key punches). This is just one example of programming difficulties that occur because the Communications Personnel on the incident do not have the software to programme and make needed adjustments in the radio in preperation for cloning.

Other issues: Priority Scan doesn't scan.

Unable to get replacement battery clamshells from NIFC for the Datron Radios.If a battery pack is broken the radio is unuseable.

Can not support the users of B/K radios with provided equipment. If communications personnel do not bring their own B/K radios and cloning cables and software we are unable to support the 90% to 95% of individuals who brought their own B/K radios.

The battery consumption of the Datron Radio is more than twice that of the B/K radio, (9 batteries per shift vs 24 or more)Changing of the batteries involves grip strength which is challenging to some of our people and at times results in damage to the holder.

These radios meet all Fire use requirements when used in conjuction with other NIFC provided systems, however, when used in conjuction with other Forest equipment or that provided by cooperators it is lacking in compatability.

The fundamentals of Firefighting are balanced off of safety, training and simplicity. None of which are provided by this radio at this time.","We modified our 205 to reflect that we had 2 repeaters which had 2 tones on each one, we used 2 channels for each repeater with a single tone on each channel.

Though the fire community in Region 6 has put up the good fight and refused to install the cheap pieces of crap in their vehicles, the other militia folks do not have BK mobiles in their vehicles.

Vertex mobiles, ESPECIALLY in command vehicles is quite possibly the absolute stupidest safety violation there is. WHY do we have to get somebody killed before the writing on the wall is written?

On assignment as an IA IC, I was unable to contact dispatch during a fire call, using my own personal BK handheld is the only thing that saved my bacon. Even that was minimal communication at best.

So, the argument is simple and always comes down to money in these situations. My non-fire program will not purchase the right equipment (as they shouldn't), fire can't justify purchasing a radio for militia folks (as they shouldn't) and since this decision came from the Region that we are required to use Vertex radios, should they not do the right thing and step up, buy what is need on a case by case need?","Venting to you at this point is the only mitigation I can do.

The engine pulled over to let a city Type II IA crew pass on a narrow road when they noticed some two crew members yelling and waving thier hands, 'stop, your on fire!.' The engine pulled over to find that the bed of the engine where the pump sits was on fire. The engine capt. proceded to remove articles from around the flame to get it under control.

With the use of the extinguisher the fire was quickly put out and they went to the task of determining the cause. It was found that a battery cover had come loose and an aluminum frame cot had arced with the battery and fuel with enough heat to burn through the metal can and ignite the fuel within.

Two points come out of this. One is that the battery cover had not been checked enough for quality and had rotted allowing it to release the cover on the bumpy road. This was the key cause. The second point is that the crews were being safe allowing vehicles to pass giving them time to realize the burning engine. They reacted calmly not making the problem worse by using water on a gas fire. They communicated effectively allowing the crewmember to quickly locate and bring the fire extinguisher to the fire and thus putting it out.

The fire was burning in a previously burned fire scar, fuel types consisted of light, flashy, 1 hour fuels. The weather and fire behavior encountered was unusually high for so early in the season. The fire had actively burned through the night with significant growth.

The crew received an assignment to tie in with a hotshot crew working the right flank of the fire. After receiving a thorough briefing from the squad boss of hotshot crew, we began completing hand line to the NW using the hotshot’s crew hand line as an anchor point. Our crew worked from 0800 to 1300 taking several breaks to rehydrate and a 20 minute lunch. After completing approximately ¾ of a mile of hand line which we tied into a crew working towards us, we then turned back to further reinforce and secure the line. We stop on a prominent point to serve as a lookout and take a longer break. The crew’s morale and physical condition was still very high after completing the operation. At 1630 I made the decision to release the crew back to the truck to refurbish their tools and packs, at that time one crew complained of having a slight headache. I remained as the lookout until 1730, then returned to the truck to refurbish my tool and pack. I checked the status of the employee with the head ache to find out his condition had worsened. His overall physical appearance was weak and unable to sit up right complaining of nausea and an upset stomach. I made the decision to transport the patient to ICP to monitor his condition and provide transportation if necessary. The patient condition worsened during the initial trip to the ICP. He began to vomit and was unable to rehydrate and maintain fluids. At this point I made the decision to transport to the nearest hospital by helicopter.

At 2000 I received a phone call from the helibase notifying me that a second crew member had the same symptoms as the first. I quickly made the decision to transport the second patient based on the diagnosis of the first, which was severe dehydration.","After a comprehensive AAR with everyone involved, we concluded:

•	The first shift of the season should be light to moderate to acclimate to the physical requirements of firefighting.

•	It is essential for the supervisor to regulate the work environment so that employees are able to acclimate to the weather and strenuous physical requirements required during fire line construction.

•	The physical demand on the human body during fire line construction is truly unique, and very difficult to duplicate the physical conditioning.

•	Individuals that have previously suffered from heat stress or heat disorders are more susceptible to than those that have not.

The vehicle towing the trailer was a Chevrolet Silverado 2500. Extreme North Trailers / Interior Mobile Welding manufactured the 8’ x 12’ utility trailer in August 2005 with a GVWR of 1723 kg (3800 lbs) and a GAWR of 1588 kg (3500 lbs) per axle. The tongue coupler was also rated for 1588 kg (3500 lbs). There was no indication of weight rating for the tongue itself. The two ATVs and water wagon together weighed approximately 907 kg (2000 lbs), which means that the total weight on the trailer at the time the trailer failed was approximately 680 kg (1500 lbs) under the marked weight capacity for both the trailer axle and the tongue coupler.

The Richardson Highway between Fairbanks and Delta Junction has several extended sections of frost-heaved pavement that create additional stress on a trailer being towed at highway speeds.

The Chevy and trailer were travelling at approximately 55 mph southbound on the Richardson Highway when the driver and passenger suddenly heard a dragging sound that indicated an emergent problem. The driver calmly decelerated, pulled off the highway, and stopped in about 75 yds. Both ATVs and the water wagon remained securely fastened to the trailer after the vehicle came to rest, a testament to the module’s rigid adherence to the policy of fastening all trailered vehicles with one ratchet strap per wheel. (See Figures 1 and 2.)

Upon initial inspection, we found that the 4” square tube metal tongue beam failed directly underneath the forward-most cross beam. The tongue beam split most of the way through, from the bottom up, perpendicular to the direction of travel. (See Figures 3 through 7.)

Later inspection revealed that the manufacturer had cut a 1” diameter hole in the bottom of the tongue beam to accommodate the electrical wiring. Stress cracks connected to this wiring hole at three points: one at the driver side, one at the passenger side, and one at the front side. A weld approximately 2” forward from the wiring hole was also involved in the failure. (See Figures 4 and 6.) The crack from the front side of the wiring hole connected that hole to the driver side of the weld. (See Figure 4.) Closer inspection revealed rust on several portions of the cracks, indicating that the cracks had begun opening previously. (See Figures 4 and 5.) An additional stress crack that was not likely related to the ultimate failure was identified on the passenger side of the weld. (See Figures 6.) While a preventative maintenance check was performed that morning before the trip commenced, the failing tube metal was not detected.","We removed the ATVs and water wagon from the disabled trailer while it was still connected to the truck but safely on the gravel beside the pavement of the breakdown lane. A truck and ATV trailer that had continued to the project site unloaded its cargo there and returned to retrieve the two ATVs and water wagon from the disabled trailer. We disconnected the disabled trailer from the truck and loaded it safely on a larger trailer that then returned to Fairbanks without incident.

Given the need to drive trailered vehicles for such distances under such road conditions as exist on the Richardson Highway between Fairbanks and Delta Junction, the AFS Fuels Module has redoubled efforts to detect stress cracks in trailer parts with high indices of suspicion for such excessive wear as part of the existing preventive maintenance program. We are also reexamining how best to distribute weight on our trailers to reduce wear.","05/03/2012 00:00"

Among the units responding was E-671 which is a replacement for E-75 (Type 6 engine). Wildcad still has E-75. This district also has E-71 which is a Type 3 engine. The naming convention on this forest contains the district number, and the order of the engine. (Ex. E-71 is a type 3 from District 7, E-61 is a type 3 from District 6.) The dispatcher on duty only heard E-71 because of static on the radio. E-71 was never on this fire. The differences between Type 3 and Type 6 engines are amount of water that the engine can carry, the capability of the pump, the amount of hose the engine can carry and the amount of persons that the engine comes with. This is important to a dispatcher in determining which engine to send to a fire with the information the dispatcher receives as to the charateristics of that fire. I was also told that the naming convention would change when the other engines are replaced.We have new engines that are on an eight year cycle so it would be that long before the naming would be complete. The concern is that chance of duplicating the names of engines on a given fire and it could be very confusing in the case of an accident, fatality or burn-over.","After inquiring, I was told that the first number on the engine will be the Engine type, the second the District it comes from and the third is the number of that type of engine on that given district. The third number is only relevant to the local dispatcher so it does not make sense why the third number would be relevant to a fire that is not on the home forest. The operator of the engine said that he was told to go with the number assigned so that aircraft could see the proper number on the roof of that given engine. After expressing my concerns, I was pretty much told that nothing could be done about it. This office was not informed of the name change of this engine so when it responded, we had no idea where this engine was from. The previous naming convention made sense and worked if dispatch is confused with the equipment, it could be worse for other resources.","05/01/2012 00:00"

A type 6 engine can be staffed with either 2 or 3 crewmembers and still meet requirements. By staffing a single cab type 6 engine with 3, this forces the crew to rotate who sits in the middle seat. Most single cab trucks have a lap belt in the middle position, especially the older trucks, which only secures the passenger across the waist and thighs. Newer trucks have started putting shoulder belts in all seating positions because the lap belt is antiquated and not very safe. Basically, any minor accident could result in potentially very serious injury to the middle passenger because of the lap belt, specifically spine injuries. Also, staffing single cab engines with three, especially on full, 2 week details, forces the crew to spend multiple days in a fireline situation, sitting in an unconfortable vehicle, further accelerating fatigue. Driver mobility and visability is reduced further complicating the problem. With three passengers in a single cab truck, there is no storage room for equipment like 3 radio/harnesses, 3 hardhats, 3 sack lunchs, multiple water/gatorade bottles, 3 cell phone/accessories, etc. Without adequate space to store these items, they are stored unsafely on the dash or in a rear storage compartment where they are not readily available.

Managers are staffing these engines with 3 without any concern for the safety aspects of this situation, just to be able to fill requests for type 6 engines with 3 crewmembers.","Most new type 6 engines are configured with an extended cab which solves this problem completely. Since a type 6 engine can be staffed with 2 or 3, single cab trucks should be staffed with 2 and extended cab trucks can be staffed with 2 or 3 crewmembers.","04/20/2012 00:00"

During this fire it was determined that the dispatch radio system on the Osceola National Forest was inadequate for fire needs and posed a safety hazard. Patches were made to the system to make it functional for the duration of the fire and after the fire a new base radio was ordered.

The new base equipment was shipped to the Florida Coordination Center on October 17, 2011.

On April 6, 2012 the Countyline fire began on the Osceola National Forest and to date has burned 34,000 acres. The new base station had not yet been installed and during this fire the old dispatch radio system continued to deteriorate to the point that it was intermittently dysfunctional and a ticket was initiated to correct this safety issue. It was determined that although it would be a safety issue to install the new system (radios would be down for a period of time) this posed less risk than relying on the old dysfunctional system.

The approximately 6 month delay in installing the new equipment not only posed a safety hazard during the Countyline fire but also during all the initial attacks of smaller fires that occurred within those 6 months. Whether there is an ongoing incident or not, dispatch equipment installation and repair should have the highest priority.","","04/13/2012 00:00"

We have been told that they are in the process of selecting a new Radio Tech for SJF, but have not heard anything about who might be coming or when. The radio system also badly needs some maintenance, we have a well-documented ongoing problem with USFS frequencies sounding garbled and very broken coming into dispatch. So far no one has been available to address that problem. I am submitting this Safenet in the effort to get someone's attention about the lack of radio tech support for the San Juan National Forest Fire Dispatch Office, and the potential for safety issues to arise because of poor communications technology support.","See above","04/10/2012 00:00"

Our current safety cans are all but safe, they leak, they are hard to carry over steep uneven ground and the spot welds on the handle often break.

If you are on a crew and are assigned to carry a five gallon can of fuel down an uneven steep slope to a water site to refuel a Mark III pump, you would quickly understand that our safety cans are everything but safe. First if you carry one can by just holding onto it by the handle you will quickly realize that it is too heavy to carry long distances on the side of your body (I'm 6'2' 220LBS)it will through off your balance and if the ground is uneven...well you know. If you carry two cans at a time to balance the weight which is 75 lbs. plus your tool and IA pack for a total weight of over 100 lbs. plus, how do you carry your tool if both hands are carry gas cans?

What do fire fighters do? They tie the gas can to their tool and carry the can over their shoulder. In the not so olden days we used to put our tool under the handle of a jerry can which fit flat against your back and down the hill you went. Jerry cans sealed well and didn't leak.

The new safety cans are designed so a fire tool will not fit underneath the handle and I still haven't found one that won't leak. I've been told that they won't leak if you don't overfill them but if you take a half full safety can tip it upside down it will leak or if you take a safety can fill it up to the full line, tie it to your tool put it on your back and carry it on uneven terrain it will leak. I'm not a safety expert but fuel dripping on you pack and down your back while fighting fires doesn't seem like the smartest combination.

Back to the handle on the safety can, they are spot welded and they often come apart at the weld. Hold a 37 lbs. weight on you back and drop it on the back of your legs. It been a while since I was in physics class but I do know that force is equal to mass times acceleration and an object falls at 32 feet per second squared less air friction (9.8 meters/second squared for those outside the US). To put it in firefighting terms it hurts.","Please create a gas can that is safe and doesn't hurt.","08/22/2012 00:00"

Systemic and chronic problems continue with the Rocky Mountain Area WIMS-RAWS-NFDRS program. Poor quality control and incorrect 1300 'O' type observation input has resulted in inaccurate NFDRS indices output (i.e. ERC, 1000-hr fuel moisture, fire danger, etc.) across portions of the Central/Southern Front Range of Colorado, an area that has experienced large fire activity this Spring.

Current NFDRS indices at the Bailey and Cheeseman RAWS are reporting 1000-hr fuel moistures greater than 25% and below average ERC's (near 10). This area has experienced record heat, low humidity, loss of snow cover, and has received little if any moisture during the last 30 days. Data quality problems could be a result of inconsistent and/or invalid usage of the 'Wet Flag' parameter for much of March 2012.

These indices are typically utilized for planning and decisions related to prescribed burns, wildland fire preparedness and wildland fire suppression efforts by multi-jurisdiction (local, state, federal)fire managers. Erroneously moist NFDRS fuel indices WILL: 1. Create a false sense of security; 2. Provide an inaccurate portrayal of the current fire risk or situation; 3. Provide an inaccurate portrayal of anticipated fire behavior; 4. Impact planning and decisions related to firefighter operations; and 5. Negatively impact both firefighter and public safety.","","04/01/2012 00:00"

In addition, there is a delay in resources becoming available this spring season in Region 3 due to the hiring practices.

The USFS is setting itself up for a major accident that will be directly tied to this hiring practice. When a hotshot crew is sent into the steepest and hottest terrain, they will be put at great risk if all the crewmembers are not the most qualified and fittest available. The public will be put at increased risk due to slower production times and less experienced personnel in IA personnel.

This 'other' communication center is Grass Valley ECC and they have a different frequency and different mountaintop repeater that Engine  can communicate with to ensure status, safety, and coordinatation was in place. Plumas dispatch was notified of this concern that Engine  cannot communicate with their own dispatch center while the mutual aid call was going on and they reported it as an incident.

Unauthorized radio frequency use

Sawtooth Forest Tactical Frequency 1

STF TAC 1

There is a problem with an un-authorized outside party broadcasting randomly on the Sawtooth National Forest Tactical Frequency one (STF TAC 1, 162.2225 Tx & Rx). This has been occurring since approximately January first, 2012. There are two distinct yet randomly occurring audible signatures that are broadcast on STF TAC 1. The offending transmissions occur randomly from five to thirty times an hour. The random transmissions are one to three seconds in duration. The first distinct and repetitive incursion on STF TAC 1 sounds as if someone is keying their mike and opening up a repeater momentarily, then releasing the Push To Talk (PTT) button. You can then hear what sounds like a squelch tail that you would expect to hear after ending a radio transmission to a repeater channel. The second distinct sound is much louder and has a very strong modulation and audible tone that is difficult to describe. This sound occurs randomly but less frequently then the first noise.

During the winter months, these incursions are not much of a problem; STF TAC 1 is not frequently used and there are other project work channels that can be accessed in lieu of TAC 1. There will, however, be a problem this 2012 fire season when the interagency dispatch center designates firefighters to run an initial attack fire using STF TAC 1 as their primary TAC channel. The rogue transmissions have a tendency of briefly grabbing control of your radio when it is in scan mode. When this happens, you are forced to listen to the transmission and you cannot broadcast until it has cleared that channel. You cannot predict when it will transmit. If the incursion transmits right before you want to talk on command or any other channel, you must wait until the useless transmission clears your radio before you can transmit. This is a safety issue. This is one extra hole in the Swiss cheese model that could be the final slice that lines up for a real problem. The un-authorized transmissions also force you to turn your radio volume down to escape the blast of noise that is randomly generated. You can be in the middle of giving a briefing when the un-authorized transmission occurs and be able to witness twenty guys grabbing for the volume control on their radios, then they forget to turn their radio volume back up and miss a call.

As a federal fire organization, we constantly preach to our fire fighters that they are not allowed to broadcast on un-authorized frequencies for a number of valid reasons. There are currently intra-crew radios being field tested to avoid the pirating of un-authorized frequencies for crew nets. Now that it is happening to us on the Sawtooth, I can understand why. STF TAC 1 has turned into a nuisance channel that we can’t rely on as a tactical communication resource. That leaves the forest with one tac channel (STF TAC 2, 172.4000 Tx & Rx) and that has problems as well. It is shared with our neighboring forest, The Salmon-Challis, who uses it as their Primary Air to Ground frequency.

If you are a firefighting resource ordered to an incident on the north half of the Sawtooth National Forest, let it be known that there are some nagging communications issues with the tactical channels that have potential to cause problems.","This is not the first time that this problem has occurred. During the 2010 fire season, the same problem of un-authorized frequency use was happening. After further investigation, it was determined that the problem was being transmitted by a facility on a local Air Force base. The transmissions did stop for the 2011 fire season, but have since started again. If the Air Force needs our assigned frequency for some reason, an easy mitigation would be to let the Air Force have our assigned frequency and find a replacement for the forest to use. All we need as a forest is our two clean and dedicated tactical channels to use. As a firefighter, I don’t care what the frequencies are as long as we can call them STF TAC 1 and STF TAC 2 to use for our own purposes.

The problem with the Sawtooth Forest Tactical Channel 2 (STF TAC 2), which is now the same as our neighboring Salmon –Challis National Forest primary Air to Ground frequency has been mitigated but not fixed. The mitigation involves our local interagency dispatch center assigning STF TAC 1 or a borrowed Idaho Department of Lands tactical channel for initial attack fires north of Galena Summit. Once again, this is mitigation, but not a fix for the problem.

This localized communication problem has been dealt with once but has returned. Our local radio technician has done all he can to fix the problem.","06/20/2012 00:00"

For two days prior to cutting a ticket, there were intermittent periods of static on the Pike County Repeater. On December 10th the interference became so bad that dispatch could no longer hear voice through the static. Each of the districts on the forest are carrying out their Fall prescribed Fire Projects. LCES is just as vital to prescribed fire as it is to wildfire. Law Enforcement Officers are very busy this time of year as well. Due to this activity the ticket was cut as a severity level one. The dispatch center needed this issue resolved as quickly as possible for field personnel's safety.

It is understandable there could be some initial delay in repairing the site do to use-or-lose leave this time of year and coordinating a technician as the Plumas technician is also on leave. In the initial correspondence thread on the 10th this coordination is documented. Although in the second thread on the 10th two hours after the ticket was cut, there is a response that the site (Pike Co Repeater) is already snowed in. As of today December 17th Pike County Repeater site has received no snow.

On December 11th a forest dispatcher called to check the status of the ticket because the site was now causing interference on multiple channels forest wide. Also on the 11th according to the discusion thread the local technician dropped the severity level from one to three, indicating that the Lexington and Sunset repeater sites could be used in lieu of Pike County. This would be a standard operating procedure all of the time, the interference of Pike County is affecting all of the repeaters not allowing this to be an SOP. Field units attempting to utilize the Sunset Repeater are not being heard through the static in the ECC.

The discussion thread does not indicate that any other action was taken between the 11th and when the dispatcher called back on the 15th. to check on the status of the ticket. On the 16th the thread states that PG&E is still unable to get up to the top to fix the problem. Now the issue is that there is a lack of parts. The parts are now on order and there is a trip scheduled for the second part of next week between the 23rd and 25th, we will be updated again at that time.

Waiting an additional week for repair is unacceptable, and affects the safety of field going personnel on the forest.","Have dispatcher continue to communicate with Help Desk. Remain in constant communication with field personnel and remind them to be patient.","12/17/2009 00:00"

All proper PPE was reported to be in place at the time of the accident. The burn was a low complexity burn on another cool day. We had a burn team that consisted of a RXB3 and a number of seasonal ENGB and FFT2 firefighters working around a number of residences where fuels treatments have occurred and we were completing the final phase of the treatment which was burning slash fuels that had been piled. The FFT2 was igniting piles and as he was near finishing his fuel cycle with his drip torch he opened up the top of the touch and emptied most of the remaining fuel in his torch onto a slash pile that had not been ignited yet, as he emptied his torch mix onto a pile, another igniter came along and began to ignite the opposite side of the same pile. The fuel from the open torch then ignited catching the igniter that dumped the remaining fuel from his torch on the pile by surprise because of the quick flare. he said 'when I saw the slash fuel ignite it caught me off guard and I panicked, I then turned to get away from the ignited slash pile as quickly as I possible could, as I turned I threw my drip torch over my shoulder there was fuel still in the torch and it spilled down my back and onto my right leg then the fuel ignited then I ran clear if the pile and fell to the ground'. The other igniter quickly came over to suppress the open flame using dirt. The burned individual was transported to the local health clinic that was located within ten minutes of the site where the accident happened.

Contributing Factors

1) Improper use of ignition device. (The top of the torch was opened and fuel was dumped onto a slash pile).

2) Slash fuel was a hot mix. (Slash mixed improperly unleaded / diesel mix ratio was not properly mixed to 4/1).","1) During pre incident briefing review Job Hazard Analysis and ensure proper use of ignition devices are being followed.

2) Drip torch fuel is mixed properly and fuel cans are labeled with fuel type or fuel ratios.    1) Update the Job Hazard Analysis to address proper use of hand ignition devices and drip torch mix ratios.

The Panama Flame Gun is designed to be presurized and slung over the shoulder during use, if loose fittings are undetected it is likely the operator will be saturated w/ drip mix resulting in skin rashes, and significantly increased combustability. My introduction to the Panama Flame Gun was during cool, damp Fall conditions; as such, I was wearing several layers of heavy nomex that absorbed a considerable amount of drip mix before I realized there was a leaaky connection. I was essentially turned into a firing device.","Apparently this is a known design flaw as wrenches for adjusting the connections are built into the handle and wand.

To avoid becoming soaked w/ presurized fuel care must be taken to ensure fittings are tight before use & connections need to be checked regularly.

Other corrective actions: Panama Flame Gun is not being used unless it is clearly the best tool for the job.

The use of teflon tape to secure the fittings was considered, it was thought the tape would melt and be not be a lasting fix.

The use of camlocks or other quick release connectors that are able to swivel should be explored.","10/08/2009 00:00"

THe air operations on this incident has affected the acreage growth of this fire and has also put it's priorities above the safety ane welfare of the firefighters.

For two week I have consistantly seen supplies orders a shift earlier not get to the troops who are spiked out. One example was an LACO Supt. who order water and Gatorade for 150 personnel out on a ridge at 9:00am. The order was to be slung in by no later than 12:00 pm. At 12:30 pm the Supt. called and asked the location of the water and that his personnel was low on water. He was told it was on the way. He continued to call every 30 min. At 2:00 pm he advised that his personnel was completely out of water and that the incident could be looking a possible medivacs for heat related issues due to no water in 100 degree weather. The response back was that the aircraft priority mission was to drop water on active fire in another division.

The LACO Supt. got his delivery at 4:30 pm, 4 1/2 hours later.

Another incident that occured involved Hotshot Crews trying to cut direct line that was declared as a priorty by the IC. The crews where held up above a drainage with fire. Operation stated that this was a priority and that the crews would have heavy helicopters dropping in the drainage at 8:00 am as the crews hiked in. As the crews arrived ay about 9:0am, no aircraft was in sight. Several request where made as to where the aircraft was and the need for them in order to hold the line. At 10:00 am the fire left the Squaw Canyon drainage causing a 1500 acre slopover.

Another incident that occured and ended up in the media was the 'Rescue of 65 fire personnel from Chileo Fire Station.' This was a declared emergency air evacuation of personnel from the station (Strike Team Engines, 2 hotshot crews, civilians, and local agency personnel). The location was defendable and a safe escape route was available (Hwy 2 to Wrightwood). We where directed to park all Division assigned vehicles in a safety zone and wait to be flown out by Sheriffs Helicopter. The fire was no where near us, although the threat was there. The idea of exposing my personnel to an emergency air evacuation when not needed reminded me of the Iron Complex helicopter accident that killed 11. I refused and drove back to ICP. I am unclear as to why this team refused to listen to those on the ground when told that we are all safe, the area was defendable and we do have a safe egress. It was a higher risk for my folks do be exposed to an emergency air rescue in a Type 1 helicopter than to either shelter in place or drive away.

Today my crew was flown into the Winston ridge which has extreme steep ridges 70% on up. The crew had hiked up and down the last two shifts. It takes the crew roughly two hours up and down each way. It was agreed by the Branch, Air Ops and Operarions to fly the crew in and out this last shift to avoid long term exsposure to the steep terrain and fatigue. Due to a lot of crew being flown out of the wilderness at 5:00pm we agreed to be flown out at 3:00pm. At 3:00 pm we where notified the the crew shuttle wasa canceled and that we would need to hike down. When asked who and why was the shuttle was cancelled, air attack stated 'operations cancelled it and I do not understand why because we can do it'. I spoke with Division and he verified that all involved agreed to this mission and does not now why it was cancelled but this is how these team has operated since he has been here.","Chose to drive vs. flying out, Continued to cut more direct line, Slowly hike my folks out and filled out a SafeNet.","09/11/2009 00:00"

On August 31st, while on the fireline (a road) in Division C, the SOFR was approached by a Firefighter (FF) regarding the whereabouts of DIVS C, in regard to placing some type of water handling equipment in the Division. The SOFR told the FF that he was somewhere in the Division and to contact him on the radio. The FF asked what channel and SOFR told him which one. The FF asked what frequency and SOFR told him to refer to the Shift Plan or IAP. The FF said he did not have one. The SOFR then determined the FF was in fact a Helitack Crewmember or Module Leader (HT).

This was occuring late morning during a time of warmer, drier, and windier weather and associated increasing fire behavior, including spot fires, and associated Operational activities.

SOFR asked the FF/HT the following questions:

1) Did you have an OPERATIONAL briefing today?

2) Do you have a current Shift Plan or IAP?

3) Do you have the OPERATIONAL frequencies programmed in your radio?

The HT answered NEGATIVE to all the above questions. The HT concededthat he had 'Air-to-Ground and Deck' programmed in his radio and the SOFR informed him that those were not valid on this fireline.

Three more HT appeared in a vehicle and the SOFR asked them the same three questions. The other three HT also answered NEGATIVE to all the above questions and they also had 'Air-to-Ground and Deck' programmed in their radios.

Therefore, there were a total of four Helitack on the fireline during increased fire behavior and associated OPERATIONAL activities in violation of LCES and the Ten Standard Orders.

The second incident on or about September 2nd involved an Operations and Air Operations decision to NOT send a Helitack Module to assist on the fireline to contain a cluster of three spotfires in Division F. The reason given not to engage was because their 'situational awareness' was lacking because they've been 'sitting around the Helibase for several days.'","During the August 31st incident, the SOFR informed all four Helitack that because they had: (1) NO OPERATIONAL briefing today, and (2) NO current Shift Plan or IAP, and (3) NO OPERATIONAL frequencies programmed in their radios that they were in violation of LCES and the Ten Standard orders and must leave the fireline, which they did.

That evening, the SOFR mentioned the incident to the SOF1, who passed it onto the Air Operations supervisors after briefing the next day.

The following morning (9/1), the SOFR visited the Helibase and briefly discussed the incident and associated circmstances with the Air Operations supervisors and respectfully discussed in more detail with the Helibase Manager, HEBM Trainee, and several of the Helicopter Managers, including the previous day's HT supervisors. All agreed that Helitack were 'firefighters first' and that to engage in any fireline duties on the fireline, one MUST have the following as a minimum: (1) an OPERATIONAL briefing, AND (2) a current Shift Plan or IAP, AND (3) the OPERATIONAL frequencies programmed in their radios.

It is generally understood that there are many competent, safe, efficient Helitack Crews, however, it is equally held that most of the Air Operations Modules have allowed themselves to fall away from the overall Fire Operations world, and instead view themselves as separate. This is a dangerous precedent to allow and hold and it must be corrected and stopped.

Regarding the second incident (9/2), the Helitack Module was 'traded' for an IHC that successfully and safely accomplished the spot fire assignment. The Helitack Module was assigned to mop up in another Division with another IHC. The spot fires totalled five acres upon containment in moderate terrain with a system trail below leading in and out of the area.

Has the fact that a Helitack Module has been 'sitting around the Helibase for several days' become a new standard in situational awareness that Operations must consider for engagement? Will this be a future consideration for Initial Attack?

An identical SAFECOM will be filed on these incidents as well.

The delay in this SAFENET is due to complications with the server and several failed attempts to mail this through the SAFENET system.","09/18/2009 00:00"

Three BLM type 4 engines were requested by the state to assist on the fire. Once on scene, the resources were asked to travel to the northwest corner of the fire and assist Box Elder County resources with a firing operation. The fire at this time as around 1000 acres. The county resources were on a ridge top burning off an indirect disk line bringing fire downhill with them. Progress was slow due to changing winds and light flashy fuels. A red flag warning was in effect for the day due to a passing cold front producing low RH values and high winds. The lead BLM truck decided to drive down a tight drainage to reach the county resources. The other BLM engines did not feel comfortable entering the drainage due to the fire proximity with high winds and no anchor point. Once you entered the drainage you were committed to going to the bottom with no escape routes or safety zones. One engine  decided to send in a chase truck with the engine captain to evaluate the situation. Both resources arrived safely at the bottom of the drainage. The main fire was now directly to the south and downslope from the county resources. Winds at this time was mostly SW, but shifting. The BLM engine already in the drainage attempted to climb a very steep hillside to assist the county resources. This engine was in between the disk line and the main fire below. They made it 3/4 of the way up the hill and got stuck due to the slope. The chase truck ordered the vehicle to hold position in the bottom facing the escape route back the way they came. At this time, the winds shifted to the south and became gusty. The main fire immediately picked up and ran upslope towards the stuck engine. The personnel on the engine jumped out, grabbed a knock down hose and attempted to wet the area on the passenger side towards the advancing fire. No packs were worn and fire shelters were in the bins of the truck with the gear. The flame lengths were 25+ feet with flame heights only 1-3 feet. The fire quickly overran the personnel and the truck. One individual turned and jumped into the passenger door of the engine. The other two individuals turned and started running across slope away from the fire. They both realized that they could not outrun the fire. One turned back and ran to the drivers door of the truck and jumped in. The last individual continued to run sidehill until the fire started to overtake him. At this time, he turned and ran directly downhill towards the chase truck. One of the other engine captains got out of the chase truck and got a drip torch ready. The main fire was continuing to come from the south towards the chase. The captain started burning back the direction they came to cut off the advancing fire. Flames heights had increased to 10-15 feet. He brought fire back up and tied into the disk line to create an anchor point. When this anchor point was established, he ordered the two waiting engines to come down and assist with the holding of the anchor point and evaluation of the firefighters. The anchor point held and the main fire ran out through the drainage where the chase truck had been located. The two Box Elder County resources were able to back up into the black from their firing operations. One individual from the engine in the drainage received minor burns to the left side of his face due to radiant heat. That engine seemed to have minimal damage due to the speed at which the fire past and the light fuels surrounding the truck. If fuels would have been heavier, this could have easily been a fatal burnover.","Conducted a burnout to the west and south to establish an anchor point. This created a safety zone and escape route into the black. From this point, took the lead on initial attack and plans. Passed on information along the chain of command to notify parties of what happened. Gave the crews a proper briefing and established LCES.

The main problem with this situation was the lack of LCES and in a hurry to attack the fire. Most individuals immediately recognized the situation as a huge watchout. The engine in the drainage was not going to make the climb up the hill. Even if they did, they was no where for them to go. They would have been in the way of the county burnout. The plan should have been to anchor in and bring fire with the trucks.

Also after the situation was over, they was no notification to the IC. The burned-over engine acted like this was a normal occurence and resumed normal operations. The whole situation was overlooked and not talked about. One of the engines waiting outside the drainage brought this up to his FOS and passed it on to the Salt Lake BLM AFMO who had no idea of the situation.","08/31/2009 00:00"

Upon arrival at AFS I discovered that not only was the Transportation Office not open, which I knew, but there was no one around.

Before demobilizing from Circle City I called the AFS Transportation Office to let them know that I would be arriving that evening and wondering what to do with the keys to the vehicle. I was told that the office would be closed and to drop them by when I came in the next day.

I departed Circle City with two other people at around 1845. We stopped briefly at Central to drop off some things for the T3 Plans person and continued on to Fairbanks.

From Circle City to Fairbanks is about 160 miles with the first 100 or so miles a two lane gravel/dirt road. There is not much traffic and this particular evening there was wind and clouds at the summit between Central and Fairbanks. There are any number of places along the route where a vehicle could go off of the road and not be noticed for a long period of time. There is no cellphone or radio coverage.

The symptoms of these problems are intermittment lose of communications from the Northeast Washinton Interagency Communications Center (NEWICC)to field personnel when communicating on Forest repeaters. This has become a signficant concern during on-going Intial Attack and Extended Attack fire suppression operations.

The overall problems are related to the radio system being routed over the network. What has developed into a chronic problem is the result of numerous issues with various telecommunications vendors not adequately resolving on-going requests to fix the situation. NEWICC personnel initiated Ticket #: 090527-001844, which can be accessed for case history if needed.

The need to maintain radio communications presents the obvious safety issues with fire personnel and other Forest personnel. Additional to the impacts to Forest personnel Washington DNR, Spokane BLM, and US Fish and Wildlife personnel depend on the Colville NF radio system for fire suppression operations. It is difficult for the Forest to redeem the agreements and responsbility to these other agencies for sustained radios communications without these chronic issues being addressed.

Issues with phone communications to the Ranger Districts is related to overall network performance as well. The problems with the phone service is that without notice phone calls are dropped and several hours of outages have occured throughout the same time frames identified above. These remote units have limited cell phone coverage, and in combination with poor performance of the radio system, outages of the phone system and limited cell phone coverage provide significant challenges to provide a safe working environment for employees.","Issues related to Ticket #: 090527-001844 need to be completely resolved as soon as possible.

The related problems with the phone systems need to be properly diagnosed and actions taken as soon as practical. These issues are most significant at the Sullivan Lake Ranger District, and Republic Ranger District officers.

Longer term solutions to the radios system have been proposed by the local Radio Technicians and have support from Fire Management peersonnel on the Forest. That being that a redundant radio system be put into place that does not utilize routing over the network. This would result in base stations being placed on Colville Nountain, and Mount Leona and then having a UHF link completed. These actions would provide the same coverage that currently exists using the network and has been discribed as feasible and desirable by the Radio Technician.    Tickets have been placed to identify the issues but actions are not controlled by the Forest.","08/06/2009 00:00"

This creates a situation where critical information is repeatedly lost between dispatch, field and aviation units. Often the dispatcher is forced to ask repeatedly for clarification, which then adds to the amount of traffic on the frequency. This condition has frequently forced field units to communicate strictly by celluar phones, resulting in a loss of situational awareness.

2009 edition of Alaska Handy Dandy (Field Guide) was not complete and unavailable for 1500 out of state resources mobilizing to Alaska throughout the 2009 fire season.

Result:

Approximately 1500 individuals were not properly equipped with valuable reference material found in the latest Alaska Handy Dandy (Field Guide) and instead issued a 2006 edition, which was the most current available. The information to be included in the new edition of the guide is current, relevant, and includes topics and information which can aid fire fighters/resources in decision making while on/in support of incidents in Alaska in the following areas;

-Alaska fuels, fire behavior, CFFDRS information

-Alaska operational field tactics

-Alaska environmental concerns

-Alaska remote camp logistics procedures

-Alaska aviation assets, usage, procedure, and airstrip information

-Alaska remote safety and emergency procedures

-Alaska communications

-Additional miscellaneous Alaska specific information

Incoming personnel received variable in-briefings, in regard to content, duration, and delivery. Issuing and utilizing current Alaska Handy Dandy (Field Guides) ensures consistency and supplements in-briefings, regardless of quality, amongst out of state resources. Additionally, the content in the new, unreleased guide includes information in response to lessons learned from the large Alaska fire seasons of 2004 and 2005.

This caused my employee to be in a hurry.","On July 30, 2009 a demonstration water drop using the new Evergreen B747 was planned to be conducted on the Railbelt Complex. A PIO2 trainee working for me was interested in photographing the event. The July 30 drop was postponed due to smoke affects on visibility. The drop did take place on July 31 when smoke conditions permitted, at about 1700. He photographed the supertanker from the top of the Arctic Wolf drilling tower which is about 115 foot tall. I directed him to get permission to climb the tower and to get safety training and PPE from the safety managers on the drill rig site, which he did. The individual is in good physical condition.

The safety concern or issue is that the PIO2 works for the BLM and they have a handbook for their 'Tower Climbing and Fall Protection' program. This handbook was not consulted.

This incident did not result in an accident.","A summary of the BLM tower climbing policy is shown below:

'The Code of Federal Regulations (OSHA) requires that a program be in place for Tower Climbing and Fall Protection. The goal of the program is to provide for the safety of employees and contractors that perform elevated telecommunications work. To do so, means defining the technical, engineering, operational, training, equipment, medical and records requirements from various safety, telecommunications and industry sources. This policy and Handbook were created to consolidate the various policies, regulations and procedures into a single program that is uniform across the bureau.'    Myself and the PIO2 who climbed the tower have met with the 2 team safety officers (1 BIA and 1 BLM) and 1 fireline safety officer (BLM)who is also an OSHA compliance safety officer for the BLM.

We all agreed that before any kind of hazardour activity is conducted that is out of the ordinary as related to a fire assignment an extra effort needs to be made to determine if there is specific agency policy in place that governs that activity and then to follow that policy.","08/02/2009 00:00"

The burn went as planned, and there was no need to use the engine. However, on the drive back Townsend Ranger District, the engine displayed the message “Drive To Clean Exhaust Filter.” When this message appears, according to a memo from Ford, the vehicle must be driven above 30 mph for at least 20 minutes to clean the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). For this reason, my Engine Boss directed me to follow the vehicle’s instructions and continue driving to clean the filter. We were almost back at the District when the message appeared, and we were forced to drive 20 minutes out of town and back to completely clean the filter.

This unannounced filter cleaning poses three inherent safety problems. The most obvious is the potential for the cleaning cycle to initiate at a time where the engine is being utilized for suppression and cannot be immediately driven away at all, let alone for at least 20 minutes at over 30 miles per hour. According to our Ford memo regarding the “Drive to Clean Exhaust Filter” message, if the “message is ignored, your vehicle is operating in a manor which continues to fill the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) with particles (exhaust soot.)” In a fire suppression situation, where the vehicle is idled for long periods of time and driven at relatively slow speeds, there is no way to drive the desired speed and duration to clean the filter adequately, if at all. Ford further states that “if continued to be ignored, the ‘reduced engine power’ light will illuminate and engine power may be limited. The engine control module will continue to attempt to clean the filter. If the filter cannot be cleaned, the Check Engine Indicator Light will illuminate and engine power may be further limited. Dealer service will then be required to restore your vehicle to full power operation.”

Though we were made aware of this issue at the beginning of the 2009 fire season, because this engine is less than a year old our District has yet to have the exhaust filter cleaning cycle initiate in a crucial suppression situation. On July 30th, the cycle’s proximity to such a scenario made me take the problem, which I was informed about at the beginning of the season, more seriously. Twice in the last 500 miles of driving that particular engine, in fact, the cycle has been initiated. Earlier this summer, while I was driving the engine, we were actually on the way to a fire when the cycle began. Luckily the cycle completed itself before we exited the highway to the slower gravel and dirt roads leading to the fire, but had it not finished, we would have been forced to continue driving on the highway until the cycle was completed, wasting many minutes of potential suppression efforts.

The second potential safety problem is what could happen if the cleaning cycle initiates in a place where it is impossible to drive over 30 miles an hour, such is the case in many places where our type-6 engine is driven where poor mountain roads can often make for long, slow 4X4 ingress and egress routes. Again, having yet to need to ignore the “Drive to Clean Exhaust Filter” instructions, no one on our district or that we have talked to has experienced the consequences of ignoring the message. (Ford warns of reduced engine power and mandatory dealer service necessary if the message is ignored.) For a truck that is already under a very heavy load, I worry that this power reduction may be enough to make it difficult or impossible to drive out of steep 4X4 grades that may be necessary egress routes. The safety concerns of this in a wildfire situation go without saying; it is imperative that engines are reliable as possible to provide a safe way out for firefighters. Further, any emissions control device that could inhibit a timely and safe egress route should be disabled on any and all emergency vehicles where crew safety can fall on vehicles’ dependability.

Thirdly, and minor in comparison to the first two safety concerns, but none the less worth mentioning, is the extended drive time often needed to complete cleaning cycles. As driving is often the most dangerous task Forest Service employees face, I see no reason to add what I feel is an unnecessary safety risk to employees for a minor emission gain","In my opinion, completely disabling the Exhaust Filter Cleaning System on fire vehicles that have it is the best way to remedy this problem, and would prevent future associated safety issues.    My district fleet manager has done a good job informing the entire crew of this potential safety concern, and has made multiple inquires to learn more about the problem, and possible ways to remedies it. However, because this is a relatively new problem, there is to our knowledge little information on how much power is reduced in the situation that the vehicle cannot be driven up to speed to clean the filter. We have also heard of a possible computer modification to the engine that would disengage the Exhaust Filter, but until the problem became apparent and happened on multiple occasions, we have not looked extensively into this option.

At the very least, more research is needed to assess how significant the power loss is if the “Drive to Clean Exhaust Filter” message is ignored. Further, a standard operating procedure is needed after this research is conducted to decide how to react to the message in a fire situation: is it necessary to leave immediately, or can the message be essentially ignored and the engine operated safely with reduced power to finish assignments safely and thoroughly, with a safe and timely egress. As many new fire engines with this same short coming are now in operation, I believe that addressing this issue is imperative to the safety and success of fire missions and the firefighters utilizing them.","09/09/2009 00:00"

Resources responded, administered first aid, called for EMS, and assisted county EMT/Paramedics with extraction and life flight operations. All went well.

The issues we had involved our communications network.

Background: Ochoco RS and the surrounding area is somewhat remote and radio communication is the main functional communication media. We have had some issues communicating with our dispatch center this year with both Forest frequencies. Transmissions could be received by field resources, but not by Dispatch.

On the incident in question, Central Oregon Dispatch was notified, and activated EMS. Updates in information were directed to our Dispatch center, and relayed to the county dispatch, then to responding resources. Several times during the incident, Agency resources and personnel on the incident gave updates, but central Oregon Dispatch was not able to copy. They did not receive anything, not even garbled scratch. Conversely, I was in Prineville, less than a mile from the Dispatch Center, with a shorter antenna and a less powerful radio, and I was able to clearly copy all transmissions. All other field resources and area fire lookouts could also copy clearly and tried to relay, but could not make contact with our dispatch.

We took action to overcome the difficulties (see below). County EMS said the updates and information they received from us significantly reduced their response time, and the time lag for ordering life flight.

Lack of communication is a problem, if this happens during a fire event resources will not be able to engage in suppression/management activities. If another incident like this occurs, with the public or with agency personnel, the delay in activating EMS could be costly.","We have a problem with the radio network. It appears to be at the Dispatch Center with their ability to receive transmissions. They are aware of the problem, but as of yet we don't seem to have a solution.

Corrective action: diagnose the problems with the network and repair them.    We worked around the problem. We had communication with a person at Ochoco RS and they had a phone line. That person could relay information, but each relay point is another potential error.

As the county EMS people and Air Link got close we made contact on their frequencies to get them worked into the area, and updated. The county's network doesn’t work well in the forest, but direct frequencies do when they get close.

It is good to be able to adapt and overcome, as we did above, but our radio network needs to work for us.","07/30/2009 00:00"

Dispatch could not hear calls from the field, and field personnel responding to assist could not hear calls from dispatch. Other field personnel were able to hear all calls. Pisgah Lookout attempted to relay calls but dispatch was unable to hear those calls. Persistence by all parties involved, switching frequencies and making repeated calls until the message went through, resulted in a successful response and air ambulance transport to the local hospital.

The radio system had been experiencing similar problems throughout the day, with Law Enforcement having to relay through a lookout. This has been happening with the radio system intermittently for several years. The issue is known to local communications employees and they have been unable to determine the problem.

The mirrors are break away style, but the didn't work properly. The top of the bracket broke away as it should and the bottom mount should just swing towards the vehicle, but it just broke apart and ruined the mount completely.

The issue with the fan hitting the radiator housing was found on another Engine the next day, as well as, the issue with the side mirrors.

The problem with the fan is; that the front end is moving more than the engine itself. So, the fan hits the radiator housing and comes apart- ruining the radiator and other parts of the engine.

This is of great concern to me because, of the issue of getting an Engine stuck at the wrong time (ie., possible burn overs).","Any new International Type lV Engine should talk to their fleet supervisors and get with an International Representative to discuss this problem.

While initial attacking the mobile radio in one of the Engines failed. This radio had been tested that morning and found to be working correctly. It was also functioning appropriately when the engine left the station for the incident. As the engine approached the fire, they found that there radio had stopped functioning and they were no longer able to speak with the dispatch center.

The radio tower system for the BLM in Wyoming was developed to cover large expanses of land with as few towers as possible. The towers were set up to be used in conjunction with a 100 watt mobile radio system. Under the current DOI radio contract there are only two models of field programmable 100 watt mobile radios, the Bendix King and the EF Johnson. While Bendix King has a solid reputation for reliable mobile radios; most the radios used by the BLM and our interagency partners are the 50 watt model. The problem appears to be with the 100 watt model being used in Wyoming.

The firefighters on the engine were finally able to establish communication using cell phones and the radio in a chase vehicle, before engaging the wildfire. This was a protocol that had already been discussed; that firefighters would not engage fires until communication was established with the dispatch center. There were no injuries as a result of this issue; however if the current trend continues, firefighter safety could be compromised as a result of this radio issue.","The Wyoming BLM radio shop needs to continue to work with Bendix King to determine the cause of the radio failures affecting the fire program.

A study should be done to determine the safety and effectiveness of a 100 watt radio infrastructure, versus a 50 watt in the state of Wyoming.

Protocol needs to be continually followed regarding not engaging a fire without first confirming that clear communication has been established.    We have been working with the Wyoming BLM radio shop to create a solution to this problem. Beginning next week we will be testing the possibility that the cause of the failure is the 'brute force' amplifier required to make the radio 100 watt capable. In order to do so, we will be limiting the power of the radios to 50 watts. This will also let us know what effect having a 50 watt radio will have on radio coverage in the district.

The radio shop is also working on one of the repeater towers to help insure that we are getting the best coverage available.

There is the possibility that a non field programmable Motorola mobile radio could be installed in the vehicles until a solution is found with the Bendix Kings. This would however affect the ability for the radios to be used while on assignment away from the home unit.

Crews are continually briefed and encouraged to not engage incidents without first maintaining that proper communication is in place.","07/17/2009 00:00"

Cut a smaller diameter tree, wind caused tree to set on the saw. I may have been in much a hurry to get the trees on the ground. Began to put face cut on larger tree. Face cut was against lean, but wind and branch weight should have pulled tree in direction of the facecut. Saw kerf opened wider on initial horizontal cut causing me to think there was more weight into the wind. Stopped at less than a third through to reassess the situation. Decided to try the tree next to it into the wind. Wind was definately more a factor than branch weight and lean. Now two cripple trees, and needed to get them on the ground. Went back to first tree and fell it with the wind. Used wedges to keep the lean from pinching the bar, and the tree fell without issue. Cut the second tree above the initial cut and fell with the wind without issue. Other fire fighter and I were quickly discussing what happened and preparing for bucking. We failed to keep our attention on the widow maker that was so secure before the trees fell. Widow maker fell within feet of the sawyer and firefighter.

An otherwise excellent, conscientious employee immediately stopped texting when passenger requested her to do so. Later reaction throughout the shop seemed to be that it's not a big deal and texting while driving is a common occurrence so why sweat it. Comments among the work group (not the driver) such as, 'I haven't wrecked yet while doing it' or 'if you don't like it drive your own car' were stated to minimize the problem. Of course, employees do not have the option to 'drive [their] own car' when they are assigned to ride with other employees in a specific vehicle on an assignment. Drivers that assume the risk when texting while driving are forcing their passengers and other drivers on the road to assume the same risk.

The topic of DRIVING SAFETY in the program 'Six Minutes for Safety' clearly states that 'it's important to remember that a bad habit is as easy to develop as a good one. Take a good, hard look at your driving habits' and 'vehicle accidents are the source of more deaths and serious injuries to wildland firefighters than any other single cause. Vehicle operators need to recognize their own poor driving habits and strive to develop proper defensive driving techniques.'

Texting while driving seems to be the new seatbelt, that is, an issue that is generally ignored as not being all that important and being optional for all the free spirits out on the road. Texting while driving is also illegal in many states, which should be enough to eliminate the practice.","This risk and potential driving hazard should be emphasized in driving and safety discussions and training in the workplace and should be expressly forbidden while operating a vehicle in the workplace.

During radio testing it was discovered that communication between the Lovelock base station and Central Nevada Interagency Dispatch Center (CNIDC) was good but communication between handhelds and mobile radios in and around Lovelock was not possible.

There was some speculation on the radio tech's part that a satellite device at the station was interfearing with traffic and possibly the cause.

Hood National Forest has developed what I can only describe as chronic problems. These problems range from complete loss of repeaters for days at a time to intermittent failures and degraded transmit and receive quality that I believe are placing both fire fighters as well as other agency field going personnel at risk.

My primary concern is the MHF/CGF repeater on Mt. Defiance. For all intents and purposes this repeater is unusable. As I understand the problem the repeater is and has been, for most of the winter, running on back-up (solar?) power and the Com Techs anticipate its complete failure at any time. As it stands the transmit and receive quality is so poor that Columbia Cascade Dispatch cannot hear our field units much of the time and visa versa. This repeater serves the west end of the unit where we have already had several fires and Search & Rescue responses. On these incidents cell phones were used to maintain contact with dispatch.

Additionally, the west end of the gorge is where the bulk of our recreation and trails crews conduct their field work. This includes Multnomah Falls, an area receiving some two million visitors per year and accompanied by the complexities and emergencies that go hand in hand with that many people.

My further understanding is that the proffered reason that the problem with the repeater on Mt. Defiance has not been corrected is that the access roads remain snowed in.

By way of demonstrating my earlier claim that these problems are chronic I offer the following examples:

On 3/6/2009 the repeaters on Stacker Butte and Mt. Defiance went down and dispatch contacted the Com Techs.

On 4/21/2009 Flag Point repeater failed and dispatch notified the Com Techs.

On 4/22/2009 Word was passed down that a router had failed and the repeater was down for two days.

As we neared the area I slowed the engine to about five miles per hour and we all began to look for any signs of the fire on the hillside above. As we continued on, the left front tire hit the soft shoulder and the engine began to slide into the ditch. It slide down about 6-7 seven feet and proceeded to roll due to the angle of the ditch. It rolled onto the roof and stopped there. We proceeded to unhook our seatbelts and leave the vehicle. As soon as we left the vehicle and determined that there were no serious injuries, I use my handheld radio to call the Ranger Station to report the accident and call for a tow truck. After I reported the accident, we looked around the engine to make sure there were not any hazardous materials leaking and discovered that everything had remained sealed.

Each zone has 1 base radio which is connected to the Cadillac Central dispatch via the local telephone companies’ technology and wires.

Each zone also has 4 repeaters to relay radio transmission over a large percentage of our 1.9 million acres of forest fire protection area.

The dispatch center is located in Cadillac, MI and utilizes three Moducom Touch Screen Console Positions for dispatching and a master Touchscreen control Moducom system for the primary position for administrative uses in a secured room. IPFleet is used for back up when the primary system goes down.

Since the second week of April, the Moducom radio system has not been receiving all the incoming radio traffic from the west zone. The problem is intermittent and on some days works well and on others, does not. Since the beginning of May the Newaygo repeater has been sticking open and tying up radio lines. Transmissions from the southern most part of the forest cannot be transmitted with an open line. This in turn resulted in the dispatch opening a ticket and the radio tech replacing the repeater base with an overhauled repeater base. The problem continued. At one point the tech reported that the issue was a telephone technology issue and the phone companies created new cards and installed new technology the phone company stated is now due to outdated wiring in the building as well as degradation of underground wires, all of which are USFS responsibility as per the phone company.

The Newaygo repeater issue continues to cause communication safety concerns among ground forces and dispatchers as well as other line officers. Since May 5th, the Newaygo repeater is not 'opening' in a timely manner to transmit messages. This intermittent issue was attributed to wear and tear on old equipment as per the Radio Tech There are times that dispatch must hold the transmit button down for 15+ seconds before the repeater will open and usable.

Additionally, during this time frame there have been numerous occasions where out-going radio traffic from dispatch to the west zone is not being transmitted across the repeaters when using the Moducom.

As part of the contingency plan, the dispatch has been utilizing the 'back-up' IP Fleet radio. This in turn creates another issue: by having both Moducom and IP Fleet radio systems running, it is causing an echo/feedback effect for all radio traffic in and out of dispatch.

This inconsistency of receiving all the west zone radio traffic is creating an extreme fire fighter safety issue. We are currently in the middle of our spring fire season and have been experiencing very high and borderline extreme conditions on the west zone. Precipitation has not been falling to mitigate the fire danger or enhance an opportunity for the radios to work. On any given day this radio problem is affecting more than 100 fire staff LEO, Recreation, Timber staff and other seasonal employees who work on our forest.

An immediate response to correcting this issue is warranted due to the fire danger conditions.","Instead of refurbished equipment or a potential overhaul of antiquated electronics, maybe a new system may be in order to keep up with the ever changing telephone service’s cutting edge technology. It is disparaging to resources that the same issues pop up at the same time every year and the 'ticket' process slows downt he deployment of a tech who can fix it. Even when it is a priority one event , the USFS Customer Support desk has problems understanding the issues that need to be immediately mitigated. Perhaps temporary repeaters from NIRSC or even new equipement is in order. Nothing is too expensive or costly where the protection of life and safety are concerned.    Several tickets have been opened with the ISO's Customer Help desk.Resource have referred to using the 800 mghz system on loan for contact with state resource in order to effectively communicate to dispatch when on an initial attack incident. Requestinghte integrationof phone company resources to fix their problems in conjunction with our has left the dispatch fustrated as everything is now in their time line and not the ISOs.

Prior to ignition on the hillside section in the Infantry Squad Battle Course (ISBC) prescribed burn unit, the Burn Boss found large unidentifiable unexploded ordnance (UXO) that was partially buried. The individual and the Burn Boss followed Alaska Fire Service Military Zone protocol which was to flag the area, walk away 100 feet and then notify the burn boss and all personnel that UXO had been found. Prescribed fire personnel were kept out, and the prescribed burn was not initiated on the hillside. Fort Richardson Range Control was contacted and a Range Control Inspector arrived on scene and requested Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel assistance. The EOD personnel determined the UXO to be an old 81mm High Explosive Mortar. An EOD team conducted demolition of the hazardous munitions the next morning. This unit has been burned twice previously by the, Alaska Fire Service, Military Zone and no UXO was found. This UXO had probably been buried and through natural process of percolation due to freeze/thaw the munition re-surfaced. The munition was discovered in an area of low probability of UXO’s. Fort Richardson training areas are suspect for this type of ordnance due to training exercises over its 60+ year history. During a fire in 1974 the Range Control Facility and all records of previous firings throughout Fort Richardson were lost. In addition, standards in record keeping of past firings have changed thus ordnance is sometimes found outside of the designated duded impact areas.","Supervisory personnel from the BLM, Alaska Fire Service, and Military Zone have decided not to continue prescribed fire in this portion of the ISBC unit. Additionally they have decided to not use hand tools to break the surface of the ground in this area. They will use wetlines only. A thorough sweep of the area will be requested through Fort Richardson Range Control.    The BLM, Alaska Fire Service, Military Zone (Military Zone) currently briefs all resources assigned to prescribed fire about UXO on military lands. All personnel will receive a Range Control Briefing prior to working on a Military Reservation. In addition to briefing assigned personnel, the Military Zone will complete a Risk Management Worksheet for UXO and request that Range Control provide additional UXO information to personnel before burning ranges within their jurisdiction. Any personnel that respond to a wildfire or are involved with a RX on Fort Richardson should be aware that there is a long history of unrecorded Military Activity in the area. Also that UXO can be found beyond the current Military boundaries. If anything suspicious is found, 1. Flag the area 2. Walk away a minimum of 100 feet before using a radio or cell phone 3. Notify appropriate personnel that UXO has been found 4. Secure the area from entry by other people.","05/19/2009 00:00"

AND, we were told by the military that the burn unit had been 'swept' for UXO and had been cleaned up. I was a 'burner', who is a person that lights with a drip torch. While I was burning out around a grassy, mound with a target on top, I looked back at my smoke and noticed a section of it was putting out green smoke. I went back to look at what was putting up the smoke and all I saw was green smoke coming from matted grass. The wind was blowing away from me and toward the holding line 250 feet away. Also, the smoke was dense and green for about 3 feet and dissapated to being not distinguishable as green smoke (green to grey) by 10 feet from the source.","I took a photo to document the incident, notified other burners of the green smoke, let the holders know that there was green smoke coming from the specific area of the mound, and monitored the direction of the drift smoke.","05/18/2009 00:00"

The PTO would engage, but the throttle would not increase. This occurred during both drafting and pumping operations.  Although this occurred during mop-up operations the major concern is not getting water to firefighters on the fireline. This would present a serious concern during the initial attack phase of a fire.  Fortunately no resulting safety/health issue occurred as a result.","After speaking with other Type 3 Captains, both on forest and neighboring forests, similar throttle issues occurred with their apparatus'.

The only preventative measure I can think of that may help with this safety issue in the future is better accountability from the manufacturer. When forest representatives pick up the new engines from the respective locations, a full demonstration of the engines capabilities/limitations should be recommended, in my opinion.    During this incident we took a number of troubleshooting measures. First, we used the cruise control to set the RPM's at the desired level. The only problem with this is that it required 2 operators and was very inefficient. Second, we made sure the auto-kill was in the off position. Lastly, by disengaging the PTO it seemed to reset the computer and the throttle would sometimes work. This appeared to be hit or miss with the throttle engaging, though.  As a result we contacted our local mechanic and he replaced the throttle sensor, located next to the accelerator. Since then, during our morning engine checks, we have not had a problem with the throttle.","06/23/2009 00:00"

At 1008 hours, incident Air Attack advised the fire to be between 6,000 - 7,000 acres before returning to base. At 1130 the general weather was broadcast but the Four Mile I.C. did not respond to request for verification of the weather. At 1146 dispatch documented that there was still no radio contact with the incident and also no response to phone messages left on the I.C.'s cell phone. At 1156 hours Dispatch documented BLM radios were not functioning and a call was placed to the BLM radio technician at 1201. Radio tech did not respond and a voivemail was left on his cell phone. At 1202 hours the BLM District FMO called in by phone and asked why Dispatch was not responding to the IC on the radio. Dispatcher stated that there was no radio traffic coming in and that a message was left for the radio tech. FMO advised that the IC wanted the Air Attack back to the fire and also wanted to order air tankers. FMO advised that he could hear the Incident and other field units but he could not hear dispatch on his radio. At 1220, communications were established with the Four Mile I.C. by having the IC relay to the FMO via radio and then the FMO contacted dispatch via cell phone. It became clear that the problem was with dispatch transmitting and receiving; not with the repeaters or the field units. Through the home unit (Roswell Field Office) the radio technician was contacted at approximately 1235 hours and advised of the situation. The radio tech reported that the microwave system had gone out between the base station and the field office that then relays radio communication via a phone line to dispatch. A short term repair was made allowing dispatch to communicate with the field by 1400 hours. During that time the 4 Mile fire grew by approximately 3,00 acres, threatening a residence, out buildings, and power lines. Two air tankers and a lead plane worked the fire during this time. Rado communication was restored to the incident and the BLM radio net by disabling the National Park Service radio system.","Need a better, more reliable communication system that properly addresses the logistics associated with the merger of the radio systems from the BLM, NPS, Fish and Wildlife Service (the base station is in Roswell) and the Alamogordo Dispatch Center. Since the merger between the Roswell dispatch center and Alamogordo Dispatch center, aproximately 120 miles west, there have been repeated incidents of radio failure between the Roswell base station and Alamogordo Dispatch Center. A reliable communication system with an automatic back-up system needs to be put in place to avoid situations such as the one described above.

At the time we arrived to start cutting seventy foot tall trees, the wind picked up. I know from my fire training that we are not to attempt cutting trees with winds in excess of fifteen miles per hour. I did not need a wind gauge to notice the trees rocking several feet back and forth in the wind. The Forest Manager ordered us to cut anyway. His guideline was 'Utilize wedges in back cuts, particularly on windy days'. According to him, 'It is not that windy, go ahead and cut; just use your wedges'. One crew member thought wind gust was near 40 miles per hour. I don't know that the winds were that high, but; I did not want to cut these trees while they were rocking in the wind. There was no fire; there were no threats, except only to our safety. If we had not cut we/I know we would have been charged with insubordination and disciplinary action for not obeying him.

April 23, 2009 only light winds this day but we are ordered out of the area by Forest Manager, who has stated he is not currently certified as a sawyer. Another employee who has not had the S-212 class will take over our cutting duties along with the Forest Manager.

The private land where the prescribed fire was to be conducted was immediately across a county road to the west of BIA Trust land. The prescribed fire escaped off the private land across the county road on to BIA Trust land sometime between 1600 and 1700 hrs. Weather conditions from the closest 'Oklahoma Mesonet' station at 16:00 hrs on March 31st, 2009 showed the air temperature to be 58 degrees, relative humidity 19% with a west wind sustained at 15 gusting to 27 mph. Fuels involved were primarily FM1 and FM3. When the IC arrived at the wildfire he observed an ATV with a mounted torch parked on the private land where the prescribed fire was to have taken place. The IC also encountered the retired individual who openly admitted to starting the fire and loosing control of the burn just as soon as a test fire was ignited. BIA suppression resources, local volunteer fire departments and a county dozer worked through the evening to contain the fire. On April 1st, 2009 the BIA returned to the wildfire on the Trust land to take further suppression and mop-up actions to control the fire. The IC had made resource requests for additional BIA resources from outside of the local jurisdiction, as well as, made assignments to local resources for the current shift. All resources convened on the fire scene at approximately 10:00 hrs. The IC held a briefing with all the resources and resources began to take action on the fire after the briefing was completed. At approximately 11:15 hrs, the IC received notification from one of the firefighters that the BIA employee, who had assisted in the previous day's prescribed fire that escaped from the private land was on scene riding an ATV around the fireline. The IC had not requested this employee as a resource on the wildfire and was unaware of the employee’s presence on the fire. The employee self-dispatched himself to the incident and then engaged in the suppression operation without checking in or making any notification to the IC of his presence on the scene. The IC contacted the employee by two-way radio and requested that he return to the parking area. The employee acknowledged and returned within a few minutes. The IC, while waiting for the employee to return to the parking area contacted the employees’ supervisor to inform him of the situation and that he would be asking for the employee to leave the scene as he was not a resource that was needed. The supervisor concurred. When the employee arrived at the parking area the IC informed the employee that he had not been ordered nor had he checked in and there were substantial resources to manage the fire. The IC then asked the employee to depart the scene. The employee argued briefly with the IC, but then left the scene. Issues that significantly contribute to the severity of this situation are the employee asked to leave, is currently redcarded as an SOF3 and an RXB2 which should have had some influence on the individuals awareness and personal choices. Secondly, the employee was not wearing the proper headgear required when operating an ATV according to the 2008 BIA 'Wildland Fire and Aviation Program Management and Operations Guide' (Blue Book).

Cell phones are our second line of communication especially when employees are away from their vehicles and do not have a handheld radio. Employees were in the field and did not know their cell phones had been disconnected.

We also rely on them to contact managers/supervisors in an emergency.","Return the cell phone program back to the district. We never had any issues getting our bills paid.    I worked with the employees responsible for the BMDO cell phone program. They in turn have been working with theNOC to follow up with the NOC/Verizon/Alltel/Profitline to find out why our bills are not being paid. They are unsure whether it is FBMS or Verizon not paying Alltel. We have not heard anything from the NOC on a status.","03/11/2009 00:00"

Oklahoma Ranger District repeaters are not working the help desk. The help desk called the radio techs and the radio techs called a contractor who visited the sites, but only referred the repair to someone else.

A couple days we reported the Ozark West side radio is not working and the same thing happened.

When we call a radio problem in, the repairs need to be completed.

We have been doing alot of helicopter operations have had wildland fires where our only communications is on a cell phone because of this

problem.","When I call the help desk with a radio problem, the repair needs to be completed within 24 hours and they need to follow up to make sure it is completed.

Taos Dispatch never received 24 hour notification of the burn (required prior to ignition). When asked if they had completed their 24 hour notifications on their own they said no. Taos BLM was then asked for the Rx burn plan information. Their response was that it was not an 'OFFICIAL' burn, however, they did have a burn permit. They informed the dispatch office that it was in Berita Canyon and that they were burning piles. Critical safety information was never relayed to the dispatch office; Rx Burn Plan, with emergency/medical plan included, location(lat & Long)of the burn, resources and equipment being utilized, radio communications were never established with Taos Dispatch or the District Office in Farmington, communication has been through cell phone when possible, Distict AFMO was unaware of the planned Rx, mananegement/complexity level was never relayed.

The biggest concern is the lack of communication from the field resources (Burn Boss,FMO,AFMO) conducting the burn. If an emergency situation were to take place dispatch would not know where to send emergency personnel or additional fire resources if needed.","The dispatch office is the hub of all communications for all the agencies and the public.

The lack of communication to the dispatch office severely compromises the situational awareness of the dispatch employees in the office and those out in the field, putting our own employees and the public at risk.

A suggested corrective action is to keep the communication lines open ensuring that all parties are informed and aware of ALL activities, wildland or prescribed.","01/23/2009 00:00"

The International truck and engine corporation notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of a safety defect involving the front drive shaft of certain 4800 Series vehicles built between 6/30/1999 and 5/28/2002 with certain Fabco TC-200 transfer case and is conducting a safety recall to address this defect. This is what the Ogden engine has. They told me that the front drive shaft can possibly become separated from the vehicle without warning and get into the path of other vehicles on the highway, possibly resulting in property damage, personal injury, or death.

In December of 2003, I was sent a notice that International was working on a remedy and parts; they would have a fix available in December of 2004. It is now December and there is no solution. My truck has been parked since mid July of 04. This is not acceptable. I want answers. My truck is not the only one that is parked, there are several in the region. I don’t think the fire organization can afford to let a 60,000+ vehicle sit another year.

This fire truck has about 30,000 miles on it. We have never had a big problem with it until now.","I think because of the problems we are having with the International line of trucks we should look at other products.

The radio technician was aware of the RX due to the fact that the RX burn was in the general location of the tower site and he could see the smoke. Notification to the field was given directly and a switch was made to an analog radio frequency. Positive communication was established, however a human repeater was set up because of topographical barriers. At times commo was unreadable.

The First sign of problems with our particular engine, to our knowledge, was in April of 2003 at 500 miles. It was on its way to Salt Lake City from the Region 4 Engine shop in Sparks Nevada where the Model 52-700 pump package was installed. The Transfer Case over heated, leaving the truck inoperable. It was then moved by lowboy to Lake City International Truck were a “new” or rebuilt transfer case was installed and delivered to us. This repair left the Engine and Module inoperable for a month.

The Second problem encountered was in June of 2003 at 1035 miles, and was with the electrical system while on a fire. The problem encountered was while driving on a rough dirt road, the truck’s exterior lighting system along with the interior lights flashed off for a period of one minute and back on again.

The Third problem was in July of 2003 at 3435 miles. At this time, while driving off road during the support of a backfiring operation in a wildland urban interface fire, we experienced an electrical malfunction which resulted in the trucks exterior lighting system along with the interior lights shutting off and not turning back on. While removing the truck from the fireline, it became high centered on a rock damaging an air tank for the braking system. As a result of the electrical malfunction, the engine was rendered inoperable which caused an immediate change in tactics from structural protection to engine protection.

The Fourth problem was in August of 2003 at 6937 miles. This problem was with the rear wheel hubs. After driving on highway, rough roads and general wear and tear, we noticed a large amount of bearing grease leaking from the hub seal. After inspection of the hub, we noticed that the nuts on the hub plate had loosened up and caused the leak. This repair left the Engine and Module inoperable for two weeks.

The Fifth problem was in October of 2003 at 8122 miles. This occurrence was in route to a prescribed burn. While driving to the burn we experienced a metal on metal grinding noise, followed by a burning smell venting inside the cab. This over heated Transfer Case left the truck inoperable it was then moved by lowboy to Lake City International Truck were a “new” or rebuilt transfer case was once again installed and delivered to us. This repair left the Engine and Module inoperable for three weeks.

The Sixth Problem was in April of 2004 at 9369 miles. This problem was a recall related fix with the high-pressure oil pump. Due to engine design changes, high-pressure oil operating pressure, made it possible for oil leakage to be apparent at certain plugs and fittings on oil pump. The fix for this recall was to replace the o-rings and plugs on engine.

The Seventh problem was in April of 2004 at 10025 miles.  This problem was a recall related fix with the front axle driveline and the oil filter. The defect, under certain braking conditions, allows the universal joints of the front drive axle shaft to contact the oil filter. The result would be a puncture of the engine oil filter, which may cause a complete loss of engine oil and possibly an engine shutdown without warning. This may result in property damage, personal injury and or death. The repair of this was the installation of a shorter oil filter, and a change in the amount of oil in engine.

The Eighth problem was in May of 2004 at 10098 miles. This problem was a field-authorized recall/repair. The defect was in relation to the extended life coolant is reacting with the front cover and oil cooler head gaskets, resulting in a loss of gasket resiliency and subsequent coolant leakage occurring at high mileage/hours. We were giving a bottle of Silicate Additive approx 6oz., after pouring the additive into the coolant surge tank we drove the truck to the district without further problems. The following morning during the pre-trip inspection, we noticed that the coolant hoses had all collapsed and that the surge tank was abnormally full. The surge tank that had the Silicate additive inserted to it made the coolant gel and restrict flow through the radiator/cooling system.

The Ninth problem was in July of 2004 at 12396 miles. This problem started while driving back from a fire on the Highway. We experienced a violent vibration from underneath the truck, during an inspection we noticed transmission fluid venting from the Transfer Case. We drove home without any further problems. A few days later on severity patrol we experienced the same metal on metal grinding noise, followed by loud pops and bangs. This over heated Transfer Case left the truck inoperable it was then moved by lowboy to Lake City International Truck were a “new” design Meritor Transfer Case with a built in oil pump was installed and delivered to us. This repair left the Engine and Module inoperable for three weeks.

The Tenth problem was in September of 2004 at 17201 miles. This problem was with the rear wheel hubs. After driving on highway, rough roads and general wear and tear, we noticed a large amount of bearing grease leaking from the hub seal. After inspection of the hub, we noticed that the nuts on the hub plate had loosened up and caused the leak. This repair left the Engine and Module inoperable for one week.

Anyone or more of these problems happening under a high stress environment such as ours could have resulted in damage to a module, personal property, personnel injury, or death.","Results from our extensive research have concluded that the International Model 7400 is not the truck for our use and particular application. Numerous corrective applications have been used to solve the individual problems that we have experienced with this truck. The many alternatives that we have found are as follows: there are other brands and models of trucks available for use. The manufacturers Volvo, Sterling (Ford), Freightliner, GMC, and UNIMOG are all trucks equipped with a front wheel drive option.

This has been reiterated during recent investigations and reviews of accidents. The FMO is on a burn project although he has not taken annual refresher required of all fireline personnel. Someone needs to check the FMO’s fire qualifications in the new system, IQCS because some of his co-workers are stating that he does not have proper current fire qualifications.

A Job Corps camp crew (9) and their CRWB were returning from a lunchtime 'area orientation' drive while assigned to Flordia Hurricane Support at Milton, FL (Optimist Base Camp). Their CRWB was driving a 10 passenger van. The weather was clear, but hot and muggy. While traveling at either 45 mph (per CRWB) or 60 mph (per several crewmembers), a semi truck pulled out into the road ahead, blocking both lanes of traffic. All being interviewed indicated that this occurred with enough distance to safely slow the van. However, crewmembers indicated the driver did not slow until he had to brake hard, resulting in loose equipment flying forward inside the van (behind the cage). One crewmember jammed his knee into the seat in front of him, aggravating a pre-existing knee injury and causing him the seek attention at the camp's medical unit. At 1345 the IC and myself were approached by one of the medics and informed of the injured crewmember. The medic also advised us that there was concern by other crewmembers who were passengers about the incident and its potential consequences. The IC and myself interviewd all parties involved and found a difference of opinion between the crewmembers and the CRWB (driver) about just how close they came to having an accident. The van did not skid, but several crewmembers were visably upset by the incident. When asked, six of the nine crewmembers indicated they would prefer not to ride back home (to North Carolina) with the CRWB if he was going to drive. The injured crewmember is not expected to lose work hours and should be on light duty until the crew is demobed.

Emphasize the hazardous traffic conditions existing in the area again to any personnel that may need to drive out of base camp. As a side note, we discussed the need to have a relief driver ordered up to drive the crew back home, if for no other reason to satisfy the Job Corps crew concerns.    The IC is planning to adopt the 'necessary travel only' rule for all assigned personnel, and a reminder to exercise caution in traffic will be communicated at briefings.

After talking with the Captain it was proposed that the crew construct indirect fireline around the fall zone. The tree was 200' tall and about 6' DBH. We began line construction with a 20' cut and 2' scrape. After about 35 minutes the saw cut was tied in at the base of the drainage. The scrape was spread out about 100' from the bottom of the drainage with about 10 minutes worth of work left to complete this line.

The death of CDF Firefighter Eva Schicke was the direct result of the following factors:

1) The CDF Fire Captain on the ground with the Helitack crew that included Miss Schicke was not qualified for the position. His background was in rural structure fire and medical aide operations (as a fire dept. medic) and his experience in wildland fire was minimal.

2) His inability to: evaluate fire behavior potential; identify appropriate escape routes and safety zone/s; initiate mitigating actions; and determine appropriate safe tactics; resulted in a downhill line-dig operation with no mitigation of applicable '18 Situations...' and/or 'Downhill Line Construction Checklist' elements.

2) ATGS and Helitack officers in the air disregarded/denied the IC's request for bucket work at the heel of the fire for the purpose of creating an anchor point in support of the Helitack crew, choosing instead to waste unsupported drops along the middle of the south flank 1000's of feet above the heel, without benefit of an anchor point.

The result of the Captain's inexperience and poor decision making, and the lack of support by the crew's own helicopter was three fold: the crew commenced a downhill line-dig without any support, instead of initiating their attack from the easily accessible bottom of the slope; the Captain aboard the helicopter failed to provide an anchor point, suggestions as to tactics and safety, or otherwise support the crew on the ground; neither the identified 'safety zone' nor the 'escape route' required to get there met the respective definitions as found in any number of agency training materials. In fact both were completely inadequate.

As a result, FF Schicke was killed when an easily anticipated change in wind and fire behavior caught the Helitack crew on the ground by surprise.","1) CDF currently has no standards or prerequisites by which Helitack Captains are selected. CDF must develop and implement a system by which candidates for Helitack Captain can be evaluated for appropriate fire line experience and knowledge of basic fire behavior and control tactics, at a minimum.

2) CDF Helicopters must be first and foremost dedicated to the support of their crews on the ground. Unsupported drops with no clear purpose must be avoided.

3) All concerned apparently need to be reminded of the most basic of all wildland fire fighting tactical considerations: anchor point, anchor point, anchor point!!!

4) The USFS must post the documents associated with their investigation of the incident on the USFS Fire Safety page along side the reports from the Cramer and Thirty Mile fires.

5) CDF must release/post their investigation reports and distribute to the field.

6) The CDF Helitack Captain on the ground must be held accountable for his actions.

7) The ATGS and Helitack Captain (on board the Helicopter) must receive remedial training.    I have no authority to change the process by which CDF chooses their Helitack Captains. By virtue of my rank I have no authority over the ATGS program or the means to influence the decision making of Helitack Captains in the air. All I can do is continue to train my firefighters and encourage them to take responsibility for their own safety by evaluating situations and assignments for themselves and not let inexperienced rookies lead them to disaster.","03/15/2005 00:00"

Wind direction was from the south/southwest and occasionally west. The terminus of the firing operation was at the south end of the unit (1). Ignition operations occurred from both the east and west flanks securing the edges with black line. The internal area of the unit was ignited with an ATV/driptorch assembly attached. Along with the ATV driptorch operator were two additional ATV's and operators (non-ignition). A Resource Advisor was on one ATV, and the RXI2(T) was on the other. The purpose being was to supervise the ignition operations and provide an ignitions communication link to the ATV driptorch operator. All ATV ignition operations were performed without error. Flanking fire was halted at the southern most point of the western flank, approximately 500 feet from the bottom of the unit and eastern flank continued to the terminus.

Safety Issue: The safety issue occurred at the end of the ATV driptorch operations at the south end of the unit. The ATV driptorch operator parked the ATV within the burn unit (10 ft from the two track holding line) extinguish the ATV driptorch wick. The operator placed the ATV in neutral with the parking break on and dismounted the ATV to extinguish the wick. The operator recognized that the west flank fire was a safe distance away when dismounting the ATV to extinguish the wick. During the time passing in between, operator experienced difficultly in extinguishing the wick on the ATV, resulting in more time passing, and the west flank fire nearing the parked ATV to the south. In addition, the difficulty in extinguishing the ATV driptorch wick took away the operator's situational awareness of where the flank fire was. In addition, the holding forces (2 strike teams of engines) came together at the terminus and a minor traffic flow and maneuvering problem occurred. In addition, the RXI2 RXI2 (t) and the Resource Advisor were separated temporarily from the ATV driptorch and operator, to observe the eastern flank ignition operation, thus losing the communication link to the ATV/driptorch operator.

What occurred: The distracted ATV driptorch operator lost track of situational awareness of where the flank fire was at, allowing the flame front (1-2 foot FL) to get in too close proximity of the ATV and driptorch. Realizing that the ATV/driptorch and operator were in the path of the flame front, the operator mounted the ATV and attempted to move the ATV out of the flame front’s path and into the dirt two track (unit boundary and safety zone). At that time, a mechanical error occurred on engaging the ATV into a drive gear. The operator continued to try to engage the ATV into gear until realizing that the flank fire was getting too close in which the operator disengaged and vacate the ATV, allowing the flame front to move past the parked ATV. An engine was on scene immediately and extinguished the flame from near the ATV. No damage occurred to the ATV, although, the prolonged exposure to the radiant heat the flame front generated during the period of time while the operator was tried to engage the ATV into gear caused minor burns to the face and right ear area. In addition, burns occurred due to conductive heat from where the eye protection (safety glasses) was in contact with the cheek area of the face.

All employees participating on the RX fire were qualified and were operating within the scope of their duties. A JHA was included in the briefing packet prior to any ignition operations, and discussed.

Potential factors which may have caused the accident/incident: Winds/terrain may have played an effect with the west flank fire being directed to the south toward the ATV (against wind). The clustering of holding forces in the same area may have added to the ATV/driptorch operator losing situational awareness, the difficultly in extinguishing the driptorch wick may have added to the ATV/drip torch losing situational awareness, the mechanical error of engaging the ATV into gear did allow the flame front to reach the ATV and may have added to the sense of urgency in getting the ATV in gear rather than abandoning the ATV, not having the ATV operator with the radio in the near vicinity of the ATV/driptorch operator may have had an effect in having a second set of eyes watching the scene, parking the ATV within the burn unit to extinguish the wick did expose the operator and equipment to undo risk (although lessened the risk of fire escaping outside the burn unit)","Having a pre-identified location to extinguish the wick with out-side the burn unit at the terminus of the unit. Have a designated holding force (engine/ATV with water tank) positioned continually with the ATV/driptorch to extinguish fire in such events and to act as a second pair of eyes. Having the ATV operator with a helmet that has radio earpieces and transmitting capabilities. Remain aware of situational awareness during and after prescribed firing operations. List these operational procedures on the JHA and explain the protocols during the pre-ignition briefing.    After Action Review scheduled for the  RX Burn. Developing an operational/procedural plan for the ATV/driptorch unit (similar to operational plans for such specialized equipment as a helitorch, or PSD machine, or Batch mixer/terra torch). List these procedures on the JHA and discuss during the briefing. Practice the use of the ATV/driptorch mechanism. Re-emphasize that machinery can be replaced, and people can't. Safety is the first priority in any and all operations.","09/13/2004 00:00"

There was to be joint command between the two Ranger Districts. The  IC  selected from the southern district is a capable Type 2 Incident Commander. The northern district selected an unqualified individual to be the Incident Commander for that district. This individual is a professional but is only a Type 4 Incident Commander and lacks experience in that capacity. The District Ranger specifically selected this individual even though there was three qualified Type 3 Incident Commanders on the district at that time. This individual was not listed as a trainee, and even if he had been there was no one acting as trainer.

This became an issue because this individual allowed himself to be dictated to on what resources to order. His inexperience prevented him from objecting to the lack of overhead and support positions that were ordered. This resulted in a situation where crews began to arrive and there was insufficient overhead and support personal for them. For two days there was a complete feeling of chaos. There were instances where crews were unaccounted for, for at least several hours. The span of control was exceeded in several instances preventing good supervision. Considering that all these crews were out running chainsaws this situation could have been life threatening.

This situation came about because a District Ranger deliberately selected an unqualified individual to serve as Incident Commander. The District Ranger has full knowledge of the qualifications of the personal on the district. The individual did the best job he could do but his lack of experience allowed the Ranger to dictate to him how to run the incident. I believe that any qualified and experienced Incident Commander would have insisted on more overhead and support positions be filled to meet safety and span of control objectives.","I believe that it is important for District Rangers to select qualified personal to serve as Incident Commanders, even in nonfire incidents. I believe that micromanagement from both the District Ranger and the Forest Leadership Team prevented the IC from ordering needed resources. I believe that it is important for those individuals to stay out of the internal makeup of a team, or what resources should be ordered. The Ranger and Forest Leadership Team should set goals and objectives for the IC and the team and then let that individual make the decisions about how they should be accomplished.    I made several comments to the IC in regards to positions that I thought should be filled, and that I believed that the number of crews had exceeded the acceptable span of control. I did not push further because the Ranger has a reputation for retribution.","09/16/2004 00:00"

Extreme fire behavior was exhibited with erratic wind driven behavior with spotting in excess of 150 yards. The fire was burning in sage grass and mature pinyon/juniper and was in an urban interface setting. Numerous air resources were ordered and on site including three heavy air tankers, three SEAT's, four Type 1 helicopters, two Type 2 helicopters, two Type 2 air tankers, and one Type 3 helicopter. ATGS was on site as well.

Approximately 3 hours into the incident (1545 hours), the fire was burning in and around structures. Structure loss was occurring. Immediately after two helicopter resources conversed over the assigned air to ground frequency, the channel stayed open with a loud squeal issuing over the air. Numerous attempts to contact ATGS or any other resources were fruitless, as transmissions could not over ride the squeal. Air operations continued, obviously under the direction of ATGS with the aircraft, however apparently on Victor frequencies. Ground personnel had no contact via air to ground and were not in contact with ATGS as drops were being made.

I made notification to the dispatch center that we had a problem and that an attempt to contact ATGS was necessary to apprise him of the situation. A secondary frequency was requested and I was told that the secondary was being used by another fire. I stressed that air operations should cease until the frequency issue was rectified. The severity of the situation was apparently not recognized by either the dispatch center or ATGS. An air to ground frequency was eventually assigned that was unfamiliar to myself as most ground resources. The new frequency was broadcast, but few ground resources had the capabilities of field programming radios and not all resources heard the broadcast.

Attempts to talk with ATGS on the new frequency were unsuccessful. No contact with any ground resources from ATGS was heard for approximately 45 minutes. Contact was eventually made when a relief ATGS arrived over the incident.","Better communication with ATGS and the ground resources on the assigned air to ground frequency. Communications were few and far between. It is understood that the ATGS is very busy on Victor coordinating the number of aircraft on site, but air to ground must be monitored.

A helicopter coordinator should probably have been on site to separate out the fixed wing and rotor wing operations, thus taking much off of the ATGS plate.

A faster response and recognition of the gravity of the situation by dispatch to the needs when frequencies are inoperable. Multiple air to ground frequencies need to be available for allocation as incidents require.

Use of air to ground frequencies that are common and used on a regular basis by the local resources.    Attempts were made through dispatch to contact ATGS on alternate frequencies to apprise him of the situation.

Apparently the helicopter tried to contact dispatch on Flight Follow and were to low. However, they never tried contacting us on a district net or followed up with a phone call upon landing. During the burn we assumed the helicopter was flight following locally, but when it was off the burn it should have contacted dispatch.

2) When dispatch was notified that all resources were off the burn and non-local resources would be camping out at an established campground, the dispatch center went out of service for the evening. This morning, I found out an engine had been released to the White River NF last night.

It was loud and clear, so not an equipment issue. Probably due to altitude. When aviation resources come into this unit they receive a briefing from the dispatch manager and/or operations officer on procedures like flight following between incidents, aviation hazards and frequencies to use (this is also in our visitor briefing package). However, this module went directly to the requesting agency and was not briefed by the dispatch manager or operations.

The area had received significant rainfall the previous afternoon and night. August 17th brought heavier and steadier precipitation, including a flash-flooding weather alert. The wet weather made conditions very challenging. The fire was mid-slope, approximately 910 feet above the valley floor, through which Sulphur Creek ran. The fire was on a north aspect, with a thick mix of Douglas fir and lodge pole pine, with much dead and down. Slope was approximately 55% - 60%. These factors, in conjunction with the treacherous footing brought on by the heavy rain caused an individual to slip and slightly roll an ankle. After reaching the valley floor, the group proceeded to the west, towards the airstrip. After traveling another mile, conditions became impassable with full gear. Sulphur Creek, which is naturally braided and meandering, was swollen with run-off. The terrain became boggy, with standing water on game trails, and individuals began to sink nearly knee deep with every step. Additionally, the vegetation along the creek was impenetrably thick willow. At this time, the group was three hours into the pack out, and the rain had not moderated. The IC and IC trainee advised the group to hold up and went on ahead to try and locate a feasible route to the airstrip and returned unsuccessfully more than an hour later. During this time, the other two individuals had attempted and failed to start a warming fire. All personnel were soaked, and their gear was thoroughly saturated. The rain was still heavy, and temperatures were in the low 50's. The IC, after conferring with the group and notifying dispatch, elected to return to a great potential helispot about a half-mile behind. The IC stated safety concerns regarding the weather conditions and amount of run-off into the valley. The group returned to the potential helispot. The group successfully started a warming fire as the IC notified dispatch of status and gave coordinates of the helispot. At 1417, dispatch notified the IC that they couldn't use the helispot and had to go to the airstrip. Dispatch asked the IC what the reason for going back was. The IC again stressed safety concerns including weather and footing, and impressed the possibility of hypothermia. At 1435, per a District Ranger, the IC was notified that the heliport couldn't be used 'unless it is a medical emergency.'","Firefighter safety needs to be the number one priority, not wilderness policy or preventing intrusions. If management puts people into these situations, they need to trust the judgment of those actually on scene, not make arbitrary decisions from behind a desk. If I, as an IC or helicopter manager ever have safety concerns blown-off in the interest of wilderness policy again, I will discontinue to engage wilderness fires.

The owner had lost his temper a few days prior to a couple of FACL's and the Logistics Chief about another issue. The Logs Chief threatened to demob him.

On August 15 extra hose lengths were boated to the camp to help him pump the vault toilets. The contractor did not provide his own employees to haul the hose from the boat to the dock area. The contractor used the hotshot crew to haul the hose.

After the contractor pumped the vault toilets it was noticed government employees were unloading the hose from a pickup next to the dock in a grassy area. The hose had human feces on it. It was disgusting and very unsafe. The contractor gave orders to people to pull the hose and transport it to the dock without discussing it with the Logs Chief, FACL or BCMG. The contractor left the site before the hose was unloaded at the dock. He was very demanding and very temperamental and showed no concern or compassion for the people handling the hose. He was demanding of help. He had no authority to tell government employees to do this work.

The government should not continue doing business with this company or individual again. There are other and better options.

After realizing the problem with what the contractor had done. The FACL and IA crew chief doused the hose with chlorinated water and rinsed the hose.

The contractor should have been demobed before this occurrence. The potties were not pumped according to contract. This was a remote camp. One comment from management was that they needed to be tolerant of his bad performance and behavior because 'he is the only company in town to use for future fires.'

4th operational shift on the Fischer Fire

The day's objective for our 20 person Type 2 crew was to support a burnout on a dozer line located at the top of a ridge with a hoselay.

The hotshot crew conducting the burnout started working down the dozerline laying down fire with drip torches as well as firing berry pistols into the bottom of the draw

Part of the Type 2 crew set up a porta-tank and mark3 and started putting down the hoselay. The remaining crewmembers spaced out down the line watching for spots. At the initial briefing we were informed that the hose lay was to be between 1500 and 2000 feet long.

The Type 2 crew was to maintain a spacing interval of approximately 50 to 100 feet in between firefighters while watching for spots on the green side of the fire. However, due to the steepness of the draw the berry pistol rounds fired into the bottom were ineffective in drawing the smoke and heat back from the edge of the dozer line. This resulted in the Type 2 crew being subjected to ever increasing amounts of smoke and heat the farther they progressed down the hoselay.

As the burnout continued down the dozerline into a much steeper section we noticed fire activity picking up with isolated torching and fire whirls as well reports coming across the radio that the inversion was beginning to lift and the column was rising. At this point the crew spacing in the Type 2 crew was being pushed to 150 feet and beyond in some sections with active burning taking place along the black side of the line.

As we continued down the ridge it became quite apparent the length of the burnout was much greater than the distance that we were initially briefed on and that the actual length of the line ended up exceeding 1 mile in distance down slope. The average slope of the line being between 30 and 40% for the entire length with steeper sections along the line.

At this point we modified our escape route by establishing a fixed point that every one upslope of was to use the dozer line to escape uphill in case of complications, and that every one downslope of that point was to move down hill in the event that our escape route was needed.

Due to extreme amounts of smoke and heat, the physical and mental faculties of personnel steadily declined. The firefighters positioned farther down the line were subjected to much thicker smoke and heat than those towards the top.

Fire activity continued to increase with group torching as the burnout progressed. The wind started to blow more steadily and we began to catch small spot fires of varying sizes along the entire length of the hoselay no more than 20 feet into the green side.

Due the line being much longer than anticipated, we were understaffed to the point that the TFL working our section started carrying hose and the safety officer helped work the spot fires. At this point spacing was 200' or greater between firefighters.

The inversion fully lifted at 1300. Wind increased significantly. The fire began to make short crown runs from the bottom of the draw up to the dozerline. At the end of the hoselay the flame lengths grew to the point that the fire easily burned right across the dozerline separating the Type1 and Type2 crews. Three members of the Type2 crew were with the hotshots on the bottom side of the slop over thus forcing them to go downslope to escape. The rest of the Type 2 crew went upslope to escape.

Due to the lower slop over, several members of the Type 2 crew that were located in excess of 600 feet below the fixed point for determining the uphill escape route were forced to hike uphill in smoke that was thick enough to limit visibility to 10 feet. Occasionally only their boots and hand tools were clearly visible to themselves.

As a result of prolonged smoke inhalation the mental awareness of the lowest members of the Type 2 crew forced to escape uphill was impaired enough to make even simple decisions and actions impossible. These decisions and actions included operating a radio, walking with out extreme difficulty, breathing, near loss of consciousness, and trying to utilize the escape route an estimated 5 to 10 minutes before the official order to retreat was given. None of these actions were possible until the actual order was given due to the amount of mental degradation that comes with heavy prolonged smoke inhalation.

Everyone eventually made it to a safe location. Some firefighters from the Type2 crew did however require assistance to make it up the long uphill escape route. Several firefighters reported a very uncharacteristic sleepy/nauseated feeling with one member requiring supplemental oxygen on the fireline and later examination at the Leavenworth community hospital for smoke inhalation.","Better scouting of line length by overhead before conducting firing operations and engaging crews.

Supplying adequate manpower when attempting to hold over a mile of burnout.

A more cautious approach to personnel safety during a transition period. (Type2 IMT changing to Type1 IMT)

Cumulative smoke inhalation taken into account along with more knowledge of associated symptoms at the FFT2 level before it becomes incapacitating to crewmembers.

Better preparation of proposed burn out line to reduce chance of heat build up and spotting potential.

Allow adequate time for the burnout to cool off before continuing down the line to provide a second safety zone if needed

Never rushing a burnout trying to beat the forecasted time the inversion will lift","09/11/2004 00:00"

Initial jurisdiction unknown. Initial responding units and IC (WY-GTP) unable to communicate size-up to Teton Dispatch Center (TIDC) on park or forest repeater freq (our primary federal command channels) due to fire location in relation to repeaters. Fire desk in TIDC copies very little of initial fire size-up. Park LE officer on scene to assist in coordinating access over private land acts as human repeater using direct channel with IC the to relay to TIDC. Due to LE traffic on park repeater LE officer asks for break in radio traffic to receive size up on direct channel. After receiving size-up officer relays to TIDC that he will call size-up in via cell phone, again due to volume of LE traffic on radio.

I phoned LE officer and requested that he communicate size-up via park frequency as several park and county fire resources as well as responsible duty officer needed to hear the fire size-up (still not established jurisdiction, although info from county sheriff on-scene stated 'GPS location put it in NPS jurisdiction'). Upon transmission of size-up on park repeat TIDC requested he not continue due to ongoing LE traffic on both park and forest channels.

As a result the size up including location/jurisdiction, current fire size, weather, fire behavior, resources threatened, additional resource needs, etc. were not known by duty officers or incoming resources, thereby compromising firefighter safety.

TIDC eventually faxed the size up info to Teton County dispatch as jurisdiction was eventually determined to be county (private lands). Radio communication on an interagency county tactical frequency was established on scene and local commo worked very well.","Priority given to fire traffic, particularly during initial attack (size-up and resource mobilization phases) on park frequency over regular LE traffic.

Additional available frequencies for command traffic for emergency incident communications would assist to some degree relieving at least routine radio communication from the same frequency.     Requested TIDC make time for broadcast of size-up. By the time communications were clear, responding units were on-scene and jurisdiction had been established as county.

Fire reported as one acre in grass with white smoke. Initial visual while in flight from approximately 25 miles away was a well-formed column turning to black smoke. As our helicopter arrived on scene, the IC requested we perform an aerial reconnaissance of the fire. Our recon revealed a fire of approximately five acres, running and torching in pinion, juniper, sage and grass.

Upon landing near the heel of the fire, I was assigned to assist the federal engines with a hoselay down the right flank of the fire. While walking towards the engines to begin working, I saw two volunteer firefighters leaning on the hood of an engine drinking cans of beer. They were not wearing or carrying any PPE. Later, while walking back towards the helispot, I saw beer cans lying around a tractor-trailer water tender. I also witnessed other volunteer firefighters in civilian clothes without PPE proceeding to a very active, uncontained left flank.

I am very concerned about the effect these actions have on my safety as well as their own. The potential for serious injuries and burns on a fire is bad enough for properly equipped firefighters. Poor judgment, lack of PPE and drinking alcohol on the line increases these risks many times over for themselves as well as others on the line who might be depending on them for water supply, line construction, saw work and the many other tasks required to safely contain a wildland fire.","These are issues that must be dealt with through Inter-Governmental Agreements and State and County officials.

My crew from the Six Rivers N.F. - was called to the Sims fire on July 28th, 2004. It was burning on our forest, and I believe it crossed to the Shasta-Trinity as well. After staging that afternoon while the fire was rolling, we were called to do structure protection at a place called Manzanita Ranch where a group of homes was located. That night, we conducted burnout operations to save the structures.

I found out last week that this assignment was turned down by two hotshot crews and a SRF Crew before our overhead took the assignment. I don't know if our overhead knew about the three crews refusing the assignment, but I know this information never reached any crewmembers. I don't feel comfortable getting involved by bringing this to the overhead because I don't think I would hear the truth.

Too much ego was tied to that night. Our squad boss refused to listen when we told him that he missed the turnoff to Manzanita Ranch that day, so we started driving into the heart of the fire. Our captain said to drive it like you stole it because they might turn us around - he had something to prove for our crew that was trying to go hotshot. Open and honest communication between overhead and the crew wasn't a strong point. Even if they didn't know about the three crews refusing the risk, the overhead of the fire did when they asked a fourth crew to take it on. I don't want to become involved with those egos by naming myself.

I don't know the rules on whether crewmembers have to be informed about this stuff, but I know it bothers me even a year later to hear that a crew supt. said 'Someone's going to die tonight.' I don't care if I'm safe now, I just don't want this to happen again.","","07/19/2005 00:00"

At approx 1130 hrs on 7/28/04, fire crew members were granted authorization to conduct 2 pile burns in the Raccoon Point area located within Big Cypress NP, FL. Personnel/Units on-scene included: a Type 2 Burn Boss, 1 ENGB, 1 Asst. ENGB and 2 Engine Crewmembers, 2 Command Vehicles and 1 Type 3 Engine.

At approx 1135 hrs the ENGB conducted a tailgate safety meeting relating to the proposed project (2 pile burns). All Crewmembers were briefed on safety concerns regarding the pile burn project. Safety issues that were addressed covered PPE, poor footing concerns, vented natural gas pockets in the area, and to use caution when applying fuel mix to the pile and the subsequent ignition of the piles. All fire crew members had scouted out the burn piles and had discussed the operation.

At approx 1140 hrs the ENGB applied fuel mix to the first burn pile. Following the application of the fuel mix, the Asst. ENGB asked if it was 'ok' to ignite the pile. The ENGB said 'go-ahead'. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the Asst. ENGB kneeling at the edge of the pile and striking a hand held lighter to ignite the pile. As I turned around to caution him on that procedure, it was too late. Sparks from the lighter caused fuel vapors to ignite and a ball of flame jumped towards the Asst. ENGB's face. The Asst. ENGB backed away from the fire and I asked him if he was ok, he said yes and I noticed that he had received 1st and 2nd degree burns to his face from the vapor flash. The Burn Boss came over and asked what happened; we briefed him and decided that the Asst. ENGB needed to return to Oasis Ranger Station for medical attention. The Burn Boss called 911 and EMS units were dispatched to the ranger station. A burn injury kit was aboard the Type 3 Engine and it was used to administer first aid to the burn victim before he could meet with EMS units at the ranger station. The burn victim was transported to the ranger station via truck by a crewmember – approximate drive time of 35 minutes. County EMS units transported the burn victim to the hospital via helicopter due to the remote location of the ranger station. The injured individual was treated and released that day by 1700 hrs.

Weather conditions were: partly cloudy skies, light winds, Temp 85-90, RH 65%-50%. The burn pile material had been cut and stacked the previous day. Burn pile material consisted of palmetto branches and cured Wax Myrtle bushes that had been burned. The piles were approx 6-7 ft high and 12-14 ft in diameter.","On 7/29/04, all fire crew members met at the Preserves' Fire Operations Center to de-brief on the events that occurred on 7/28/04; an 'on-the-job-accident: 1st and 2nd Degree Burns to the facial area' that occurred to the Asst. ENGB while conducting a pile burn in the Raccoon Point area. Various items were discussed in developing a 'corrective action-results plan' to prevent this accident from occurring again. Items discussed included the following:

- The development of a Standard Operating Procedure for conducting pile burns.

- Utilization of proper PPE (in this case the individual had the appropriate PPE on).

- Conducting Tailgate Safety Sessions and JHA's no matter how routine the task may be. (Both of these items had been done and documented.)

- Use only a 'known' fuel mix (in this case the mix had been labeled and dated as pile mix, however its actual contents were un-known).

- Use alternative methods (toss a fussee, use a very pistol, etc.) for igniting burn piles to increase overall firefighter safety and distance away from the pile.

- Use the appropriate amount of fuel mix relating to the size of the pile.

- Be aware that fuel vapors are present and are highly prone to rapid ignition.

- Ensure that Situational Awareness, Risk/Hazard: Awareness, Mitigation, and Management are discussed and implemented throughout the entire operation

In this case the burn injury occurred to an experienced firefighter with supervisory Red Card Quals: ENGB, FFT1, ICT4. The proper PPE was utilized and safety briefings had been conducted; however, accidents still can happen when working with Flammable liquids near the fireline.    Since the accident, fire crew supervisors have been developing a Standard Operating Procedure on conducting pile burns.

All un-known 'pile burn fuel mixtures' have been removed from service and only a known fuel mixture (drip torch mix) will be used in the right amount, in the right place.

Closer attention has been placed on all ignition procedures no matter the experience level of the individual who is involved.

In closing, I recommend all units should review their procedures for conducting pile burns and focus on Situational and Risk/Hazard Awareness. Only work with known fuel mixes and pay close attention to the amount of fuel mix applied and to the distance from the pile to the individual conducting the ignition.","08/04/2004 00:00"

This fire was approximately one acre in size with active flame on two flanks measuring around two feet and one chain from the road. At this time, observations from the Richfield/Burns helitack squad noted safety concerns, which rendered themselves reluctant to take direct suppression efforts on the ground.

First, with five air resources on the incident, airspace was very limited. Because of this limited airspace, the likelihood of an aircraft mishap was increased.

The second concern was the danger from hazard tress (snags), which was mentioned in the briefing by the IC. However, crews were instructed to continue direct suppression tactics amidst heavy aircraft activity such as SEAT Drops and Bucket Drops.

At this time suggestions were made by the helicopter manager concerning these hazards to the IC. However, the IC seemed to be unresponsive to suggestions from the manager.

Another concern was that the IC was not directly familiar with the fire location and behavior. It was observed that the IC was never directly on the fireline in the two hours that the Richfield/Burns Helitack crew was present. This resulted in a lack of leadership and consequently excessive personnel on the west flank creating a bottlenecking effect.","We feel that, had other tactics been implemented, this unsafe situation would have been avoided. Seven engines were committed to the incident, which were readily utilizable for a progressive hose lay. Considering the size, behavior, and the close proximity of this fire to a road, a progressive hose lay could have been safely and effectively employed without any aviation resources committed.    An After Action Review was conducted with all members of the Richfield/Burns Helitack squad where hazardous concerns and what should have been done differently was discussed.

Concerns were expressed to the Forest Aviation Officer and the Dispatch Coordinator.

The fire burned from private land onto BLM land. The incident started Sunday evening, July 25th around 16:00. The sky weather was clear, wind 4 to 8 out of the west, temperature was around 85 degrees F and the RH was 21%.

The fire appeared to be human caused and burned a total of 17.94 acres of sagebrush and grass. The fire was of low intensity and was easily contained by initial attack forces. The fire initially climbed a slope with about forty feet of vertical rise, up out of a declivity before being driven slowly east across a sagebrush patch that was bounded by green fields and roads on the north and east flanks, leaving the south flank as the incidents problem area. At the southeast corner of this fire was a cured wheat field that was not imminently threatened, but there was a chance that a farmer’s cash crop could have been destroyed. This prompted me to order retardant to help with the suppression efforts.

Resources: Four BLM Type 4 engines, three BLM Type 6 Engines, one helicopter, one ATGS, two SEATs and one FOS, one Safety Officer, one Fire Cause and Determination person, one Rural Liaison and three Jerome County Rural Fire Department apparatus. Also, one 3000-gallon water tender that was diverted to another fire.

Unsafe Situation With Potential: Four Type 4 engines had knocked down the fire on the south flank and were in the process of mopping up the line. The lead engine had been identified as the ground contact to work with the ATGS. Air Attack instructed the lead engine (the ground contact) to clear the line so that a SEAT could drop. Air attack made a dry run and the line was not clear. The last engine cleared the line and the first SEAT applied retardant to the south flank of the fire. After the first SEAT departed, the ground forces moved back in to continue securing the line. The second SEAT then flew in and tagged his load onto the last drop, which then went a little long and slimed the lead engines. No one was hurt. Very little retardant was involved in the incident.","Recommendations and actions:

The IC and the ATGS should ensure that the ground resources have enough situational awareness of the incidents air operation to stay out of trouble. In discussion with the lead engine, it was mentioned that they did not know there were two SEATs that were going to drop on the fire. After the first one departed, the engines moved back in to work and got surprised by the second air tanker.

If the fire has been subdued before the retardant can be dropped on it, the IC or the ground contact and the ATGS should discuss the option of jettisoning the retardant in the black away from any resources or improvements that could be damaged. In certain situations, adding retardant to a line that does not need reinforcing could add unneeded risk. Dumping unused retardant out of harms way may make sense.    Education:

The local ATGS addressed the unit’s firefighters and explained the need for really clearing the line for air tanker drops.

Utilize 6 Minutes For Safety, safety briefings, JHA, AAR's and STEX's to help raise firefighters situational awareness as to the hazards of working with aviation on the fireline.

Obtain as much varied fireline experience as is practical.

Crews working on the fireline need to contact the IAIC, DIVS or the ATGS to ensure that the fireline is cleared of working aircraft before re-engaging their section of line.","07/29/2004 00:00"

Once a medical situation has been initiated several procedures are put in motion. In essence the “medical” becomes “an Incident within an Incident”. Once ICP Communications have been notified of the medical situation they proceed to clear the “Command” channel of all traffic not dealing with the medical. The issue is that while the Command channel is clear there is no way for line overhead to contact any of the Command and General Staff positions. This could potentially lead to critical information not reaching these individuals creating a situation where safety of line personnel might be jeopardized. In many cases once a “medical emergency” has been declared, two-way communication with line personnel, not associated with the medical, has been severed.","There is a “National Interagency Air Guard” frequency (168.625 MHz). This frequency is used for emergency communications for aviation. My suggestion is to create a “National Interagency Medical Guard” frequency. This frequency would be set aside for use by personnel dealing with a medical emergency. It may be necessary to utilize the Command channel during the early stages of the medical, but all of the emergency traffic could then be diverted to the “Medical Guard” frequency. This would allow for discrete handling of the medical situation and keep all other communication channels open and operational.    The IMT of this incident had a good 'medical emergency' policy and procedure in place. There has been an effort to discern between a 'medical emergency' and a 'medical transport' with the latter not disabling the Command Channel. However, when the medical is a true emergency the Command Channel is tied up until the emergency has ended. This could still lead to a void in critical on-line communication. I understand that there will be issues with implementing the 'medical guard' frequency, but I feel that it is important enough to explore some options to minimize this risk.","08/27/2004 00:00"

While driving on an improved county road at 25mph, we had crossed over a cattle guard and heard a loud THUD.  I told my driver to stop the truck and once so, we both exited the rig and saw a tire lying in the road. I thought we had blown a tire, we visually inspected our vehicle and all 4 tires were accounted for. It was then I notice that I could not see the spare tire, which is mounted behind the rear bumper and underneath the frame of our truck. I examined the area and then the tire lying in the middle of the road and determined that the bracket that holds the spare tire had failed. The spare still had our spare securely held in place with in it.

If this unit had failed while traveling on the interstate or other busy road the potential of injury to the public or others could have been extremely high.

Type of truck: 2003 Chevy Pickup / Duramax Diesel with a short bed.

The spare tire bracket and hoist is apparently held on to the frame by 1 nut and bolt and sits on a lip underneath the frame of the pick up bed.

I visually inspected the hole where a bolt and nut should have been and found none. I reported the incident to my supervisor and local fire operations supervisor. We checked the pick-up for any other damage caused by the incident and found none.

The crew boss for the task was also running Operations. The Incident Commander for the fire was simultaneously directing another fire below the Zenobia Lookout Fire Tower.

I was acting as sawyer on one of the engines, and as we approached the fire, I noted that a tach channel had not been established for communications. Rather, the crew was running on the ParkNet channel, which is to be used for non-fire communication.

The crew boss led the crews into the fire going north; the terrain was very steep, and he wanted to take the crew directly into the head of the fire. I suggested they approach the fire from the east side, where the terrain was relatively flat and where the approach would be safer and easier on the crew. In addition, the terrain en route to the fire had not been scouted out prior to approaching the fire. The crew boss nonetheless refused to change routes, saying, 'We're already this far, we'll keep going.'

This lack of regard for the crew's safety and level of fatigue, as well as the unsafe practice of approaching frontal assault on a fire, is the reason for this report.","--Ensure a tach channel is established.

--Ensure the crew boss/IC are aware of necessary safety precautions and that they take these precautions, even if not the most expedient or convenient.

--Take advantage of available air resources (helicopter for crew shuttle was available but was not utilized).

--Require the IC to have direction over only one incident at a time.

--Establish better briefings to crewmembers.    After requesting a change in route and receiving a refusal by the crew boss, I should have followed standard procedures for refusal of assignment. However, I made the choice to pursue the eastern route on my own, during which I had constant radio communication with the group and arrived approximately ten minutes earlier and considerably less fatigued than the crew. Looking back, I realize my mistake, even though the eastern route did prove to be the safest choice.

During the fire, I also asked the crew boss about the use of a tach channel, to which he replied that the IC was using ParkNet instead. I also told the crew boss that we could have been shuttled in by helicopter; he did not reply.

I informed her that I was not aware that I had been cancelled.

Several different times during the initial period of assignment I was unable to communicate with resources assigned to my division. My RACAL radio was unable to transmit or receive when people with other brands of radios, mainly Kings were having no communication problems at all. To mitigate this communication problem I had stay in verbal contact with someone who had a fully functional radio. The terrain or weather was not a limiting factor, since fire personnel on the division with King Radios were having no communication problems what so ever. The problem with the Racal radio was evident for the entire first shift. I felt that the safety of the personnel assigned to the division was threatened by the communication problem.","This safety issue can be solved by making the Racal radio a functional piece of equipment, or replacing the Racal radio with a more reliable and proven brand. I am not sure what needs to be done to the RACAL to fix the problems with transmitting and receiving, but it needs to be addressed before the start of the next fire season. Communication is one of the most important pieces to having a safe firefighting environment. By having sub par communication equipment, we as a group are putting into jeopardy anyone that is forced to use a Racal radio during fire fighting operations. To fix this problem until the RACAL radio is found to be reliable for field use, I will not carry the RACAL radio on a fire assignment.

During lunch at 1400 one of many rolling logs came down through the area where we were having lunch. There were a lot of snags and other rolling debris in the area; this situation was unacceptable because we did not feel safe in this environment.

After lunch we continued line construction. At this time we came across a large tree that had fallen across where our line needed to go. As the sawyers where working on the log, one of the saws got stuck in the tree. During this time one of the crew boss trainees sent two people back to check the line and make sure no roll out had occurred. They found a tree on fire barely inside the line. After that the fire behavior began to pick up and the Division Supervisor told us to head down of the mountain towards the anchor point on the line. When we reached the anchor point the fire had crossed the line and was making a run up the mountain.

At this point the Safety Officer told us there was good black a little ways past the area where we were digging line. The crew headed back up the mountain because by now this was our only choice as the fire had gotten below us and we could not continue down the mountain. Meanwhile the Safety Officer left the crew and headed somewhere else.

Many people on the crew began to wear down from the hike up the hill and had to drop their packs and saws as they were being chased by the fire up the mountain. I managed to make it up the hill with my pack, but when we reached the area that was supposed to be good black there was still fuels in the area and it could easily reburn.

At this time I dropped my pack and started to dig an area to deploy my fire shelter as needed. I grabbed my shelter and left my pack about ten yards away me. As the fire reached us my pack was burned over and thanks to a change in the wind the crew was lucky enough to escape.

The crew did not know what to do. There were snags that could have fallen and we did not know if we would have to deploy our shelters or not.

At about 1800 some smoke jumpers came and took the crew up to the ridge. Then we sat up on the ridge and watched as 300-foot flame lengths burned over the area we were just in.

At 1930 we walked off the ridge to our trucks and were sent back to ICP.

Three of the crewmembers were coworkers and friends of mine. One of the crewmembers works on the same crew as I do. According to their statements about the fire there were many examples of incorrect fire suppression acts.

1. The most important one is that their escape routes and safety zones were not acceptable. Their main safety zone was to go off the mountain and back to the truck. This proved to be a very bad idea as the fire jumped the line below them and raced up the hill towards them cutting them off from their escape routes and safety zones.

2. The Safety Officer on the incident told the crew to head up the hill to 'good black' for their safety zone. After climbing up and 80 percent slope while some of the crew members puked and cried from stress and fatigue they reached the area where there was supposed to be 'good black' to find out that it had just been an uderstory burn and there were still live fuels with a lot of reburn potential. Meanwhile the safety officer left the crew and headed off down the mountain.

These firefighters were involved in a near miss, which resulted in 16 fireline packs, 4 chainsaws, and several hand tools being destroyed. Thankfully, these losses were only material items, but the fear and trauma that these firefighters experienced is not to be soon forgotten.

Several of my friends and three co-workers were involved in this fire. A very close friend of mine recounted the experience to me in such a way that made me also rethink my decision to fight fires. The factors that contributed to this terrifying experience were lack of communication, inadequate safety zones and escape routes, and poor decision-making.

1.) Throughout this whole ordeal, my friend stated that they never once heard from their lookouts and because of this were unsure of what the fire was doing.

2.) The safety zones and escape routes identified to these crewmembers were to retreat off the mountain in case of any possible danger. This proved to be a useless plan, as the firefighters were building fireline uphill and the fire jumped the fireline below them and began racing up the mountain, cutting off their escape.

3.)The Safety Officer told these crewmembers to go up the mountain to what he described as 'good black'. Once he gave the crew this information he was soon gone and was later discovered to have gone down the mountain to his truck. After the crew strenuously reached the area recommended by the Safety Officer, they realized that there were still a lot of unburned fuels that could reignite. Fortunately, before the crew was forced to deploy their fire shelters, two smoke jumpers came down from a ridge above them and led the crew to a safety zone. Looking down to the area they had only just left, the crew saw 300 ft. flame lengths igniting the so-called 'good black'.","I feel that there should be repercussions against the people who break the 10 standard fire orders and the LCES.

There have been many people with plenty to say that weren't even involved with the fire. I guess it is easy to know what to do when you're sitting in the stands.

The unforgiving terrain that we were forced to run up would be extremely difficult for anyone, especially if they are carrying ten extra pounds of water like we were that day. It is my opinion that some of the firefighters who dropped their gear below our 'safety zone' were not doing so because they couldn't carry it any further, but because they did not know how far the 'safety zone' was and how fast the fire was moving. I for one left my gear where we sat because I was unaware of the location of the 3rd safety zone that we were going to. When they went back to get it the next day, a snag had smashed it flat. The other large snag that was to our right had fallen right where we had all been sitting. If the 'safety zone' was so safe, we should've been able to sit and take pictures, not pray harder than we ever had before.

We thought as clearly and calmly as possible for being uniformed of a secondary safety zone, being yelled at by those in charge (which was appropriate for the situation) having to run back up the line we'd just came down, sucking smoke the whole way and hearing/seeing the fire coming at us. The fact that we all stuck together and that others were helping those who needed it is an absolute miracle in itself.

At the point that we started running, overhead did what had to be done to save us. All (including fellow crewmembers) were critical in our survival and no one was left behind. Prior to that there were definite mistakes made, and some were our own. The safety officer took off and left us on that mountain, how could someone do that to us?

That was the most terrifying thing that I have ever been through, and I know that I speak for many others when I say that. The terror and desperation was overwhelming and until you are in that situation, a person can never understand. To hear the things we heard, see the things that we saw and do the things that we did is just unreal. By trivializing the very real fear of many that day, some will never learn from our close call. Those involved will forever be marked by our brush with death and it is but 'By the Grace of God, There Go I'.","Establish trigger points immediately, especially in the Salmon River Breaks.

During a time of transition, reconsider putting crews on the line.

Make sure crews are aware of the erratic fire behavior, winds and extremely difficult terrain that the Breaks have.

Realize that Type 2 crews are NOT Hotshots.

Leaders should keep in constant contact with lookouts and post others if needed. They should also have consistent communications with the squad bosses and visa versa.

If possible, all squad bosses, crew boss and up should have a pre-determined secondary safety zone that has been scouted by most if not ALL of them. This should then be passed on to crewmembers.

Realize that even if you are a marathon runner, that type of terrain is extremely difficult and the safety zones should be close enough to get to without running (what happened to considering your slowest person?).

Watch your own back.    I have been in contact with the FMO and local supervisors. I have sent my account to various people involved in fire and sent the AAR to other crews in hopes that they will learn something from our experience.

They were told their escape route and safety zone was back to the trucks and there were 2 lookouts posted. After breaking for lunch at 1400, there was increased fire activity and it jumped the line and got below them. The crew could not go back to the trucks because the fire was in their escape route, so they were told to go back down before the fire ran up the mountain.

Dispatch provided minimal out briefing information. I received no IC name, no operating frequency, no exact lat and long location. Having some prior knowledge of the incident area, I made the decision to try to find the incident and sort it out. At 2000 pm I found the Ely Dist BLM Helitack crew staged at the Junction of the Atlanta road and the Shoshone road. I made contact with the Assistant Helitack Foreman. The Asst. Helitack Foreman pointed out the approximate location of the fire on my Page 57 Nevada Atlas and Gazetteer and gave me the locations of 1 NPS and 1 BLM light engine that needed to be guided to the incident. He also stated that there were some 'good meadows' to use for a dip point. At 2020 pm I made contact with an Engine Boss at the intersection of Murphy Wash and Atlanta Mine roads. I relayed the info I had received and showed him how to access the Decathalon Canyon road. The two light engines led and I followed in the water tender. At 2040 the engine boss relayed by radio that the road was deteriorated and not advisable for the water tender. He suggested that I use a turn out at a summit for a dip point. When I reached the summit it was dark. I could see the fire for the first time, about two miles distant to the north. I set up a 1500 gallon porta-tank by the work lights on the water tender and bedded down at 2230 pm. At 600 7/9/04 I started work. I was uncomfortable about the size of the dip point. It looked smaller in the daylight. My crew and I decided to fall a few trees. After cleaning up the slash I called the Silver Bell IC and gave the Lat and Long of the 'Dip Site'. After I copied several radio communications about starting bucket drops between the IC and Crew leaders and several retardant drops, at about 1200 the Ely Helitack arrived. They yelled out of a pick up, 'water the dust, he's gonna land,'. I yelled back, 'he can't land here' as my crewmember watered the deck. I ordered my crew into the water tender for his safety and helicopter N214GH landed between us and the porta-tank. As the ship settled it was buffeted by wind gusts that I had previously reported to the IC. I told my crew to cover his eyes and prepare for a crash. When the rotor lost momentum, it sagged and nicked a tree limb while it was still spinning. After all motion stopped my crew and I emerged from the water tender and began sawing down more trees to get N214GH back out of there. The pilot inspected the rotors and apparently was satisfied that there was no damage. He refueled, while we moved the porta tank about two miles south. At about 1400 the pilot continued with missions. Note: throughout this incident my E.F. Johnson and Raycal radios were picking up and missing different traffic, especially on the priority air to ground frequency.","1.

I was told by dispatch that they would be on the designated air to ground frequency. I tried that several times with no luck so I landed down close to the engines to see why I could not communicate with them. One reason I found was that the engine foreman did not know how to locate, on his radio, the frequency we were using. Once we figured out where the frequency was located we were able to communicate. The main problem I see is the State has the new digital system and the FS still has the 'old' analog system.

Their route would take them into the vicinity of an ongoing wildland fire use event. The crew had gotten information on the fire's status and location a few days prior to going into the forest. However, the fire had grown in size and in a different direction from the time they had gotten a fire size up. Upon getting to an area where the fire use fire had crossed the trail that they were traveling on, they called into dispatch by radio. Due to their location, it required relaying radio messages through one of the forest's lookout towers.

The crew wanted updated information on the status of the fire. During the course of the radio transmissions, it became confusing as to the exact location of the crew in reference to the fire perimeter. Continued radio transmissions further confused the issue, especially as it related to the safety of the crew. It was perceived that the crew had been surrounded by the fire and they would need help to get back out of the area safely.

The District Acting FMO dispatched a helicopter to the area to locate the crew, determine their status, and provide assistance as needed. The helicopter did locate the crew and it was determined that the crew was not in any danger. The crew left the area, returning back they way they had come in.

When the crew responded to the fire scene, operations were on the Rifle Fire Dept. frequency. The crew received their briefing and attempted to program their radios. The RACAL radios have open banks that the user can program, but will not scan between banks. However, unless you have the time to program all the needed frequencies into the open bank the radio has no value as programmed.

As our radios are currently set up, per state policy, the first 15 banks are locked out so there is no way to add in new frequencies. The only way a radio can be used with a non-standard (mutual aid) frequency is to program ALL of the needed frequencies into the open bank. This is very time consuming, and has the potential of leaving firefighters out of communications during critical times.

This is a violation of LCES. Communications need to be established ASAP on an incident and the current radio configuration does not allow for this. The radios have the capability of accomplishing this, but internal policy effectively blocks this from happening.

The frequency lock out policy violates Red Book Chapter 6, Safety, Policy, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.","Unlock the radios so that the user can program any required frequency into any bank/zone necessary in order to maintain communication.

Radio traffic on other FS repeaters was interfering with fire traffic.

Other radio traffic included law enforcement (potential missing person) and normal communications between campground hosts, visitor centers, and recreation technicians.

The whole Forest (Medicine Bow NF) and two dispatch centers (Casper and Rawlins) use the same frequencies for the Douglas, Laramie, and Brush Creek/Hayden Ranger Districts.

Laramie Peak repeater is about 100 miles away from the other repeaters, so personnel using the other repeaters are unaware of fire traffic on the Laramie Peak repeater, but our dispatch office picks it all up and it is impossible to separate out and mute the radio traffic on the repeaters not being used for fires.

This conflicting radio traffic is a safety issue because there are times when we cannot hear a call from a fire.

On this particular fire there were several occasions when radio traffic from the helicopter and from the IC was 'walked on' by other radio traffic.

We have procedures to announce that radio traffic be limited to fire or emergencies, but these other people have jobs to do which requires radio use.

The center primarily consists of USFS Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest - Bridgeport and Carson Ranger Districts, The Bureau of Land Management - Carson City Field Office and the Western Region of the Nevada Division of Forestry (which dispatches wildland fires and all risk incidents).

We have had chronic and severe radio communications issues for years in our inability to communicate with field personnel over the Forest Service radio system. I am not an expert with trying to trouble shoot the technical aspects of the radio problems. We have tried and tried to work with our radio communications Team Leader in the Supervisors Office to correct these problems as the arise. The typical response is 'we are working on it'. If the problem is isolated there is no communication back to the Center as to what the problem was, what was done to fix the problem and when we can expect the problem to be fixed. Since this is a chronic and reoccurring issue we have been keeping a radio log at the dispatch center every time an issue is identified.  The radio log is available from the Sierra Front Interagency Dispatch Center. This last issue has prompted me to submit this SAFENET as I feel I have exhausted all other ways of trying to communicate the issues and problems that we have throughout the last 3 years I have been here.

Adjective fire danger ratings along the Sierra Front has been between Very high and Extreme every day for at least a month. It's the 4th of July weekend and we are expecting lightning for the next several days. I went into service on the morning of 07/02/2004 and tried to make contact with Minden to let them know I was in-service for the day. Minden called me on my cell phone and informed me that the microwave link to Minden had been down for over half an hour.

On July 2, 2004 at approximately 1300 Minden toned out an emergency wildland fire report at Sponner Summit just 10 miles south of Carson City Nevada. The issued command frequency was HTF 'Rawe' tone 4, the tactical freq was White Fire 1 and the Air to ground was 170.225 - our primary initial attack designated frequency - a typical response. I responded from the District Office to the fire as the Forest Service Duty Officer. I made contact with air attack on air to ground for a fire size up and any additional needs. I attempted to contact the Dispatch Center to cancel all responding ground units and was unable to make contact and lost all communications with Minden. A phone call was placed by the AFMO who could hear my attempts to make contact. When the Minden was notified they immediately contacted me on a backup base station, which bypasses the microwave link from the mountain top repeaters to the center (a small base station located in the corner of the room). Since this was a backup system I made the decision to have the Dispatch Center to activate the emergency back up plan using the BLM and the State freq's as a command channel for all future emergency wildland fire tones on National Forest Lands.

There was a failure to accurately access the fire situation, hazards, and risks on the Nuttall Fire in regards to staffing all the helispots on the fire.

2.	There was inadequate integration of helispot operations in the Nuttall Fire operations.

The helitack personnel, after being dropped off at helispots, were largely disconnected from ongoing operations. Communications with them were inadequate.

•	It was decided at the morning briefing that all helispots were to be staffed by helitack. Regardless, if they were only suitable for Type 3 helicopters and regardless if the helispot was in a precarious spot. Some of the helispots were in a position where inadequate safety measures were in place. Inadequate safety zones, escape routes, and limited communications with adjoining forces on the division. To my knowledge, the helispots were not approved by the Helibase Manager, or Air Operations, or Air Support. The location of the helispot I was assigned to was midslope, had unburned fuel between the helispot and fire, and had no good safety zones. The helispot was approved by a Helicopter Manager, but only for helicopter use, which I view as a logistical need. The helispot was not identified as a place were operational tasks could be completed, and inspected to make sure it was worthy of leaving folks there to staff it, in regards to making sure all safety criteria was mitigated.

•	In some cases, helitack did not have adequate supervision to provide for their safety, and there was confusion as to who their supervisor was, (Division Supervisor, Operations, Air Attack, etc.) This can be attributed to poor helibase briefings.

•	There was no agreed upon course of action to mitigate the changing and dangerous situation for the helispot operations until it was too late.

•	One of the helispots which was staffed by helitack, had an obscured view of the fire below them, and the possibility of lack of awareness about changing fire activity, resulting in insufficient information upon which to make appropriate decisions (possibly disengaging) and causing them to act as if they were in a secure position.","1. Follow the rules that are in place, 10 & 18. The number one priority should be yourself, don’t trust the overhead to make conscious decisions when they aren’t in a position to see what the fire is doing. Trust your instincts, if the hair is standing on the back of your neck that should be an indication that current conditions aren’t ordinary. The bottom line is to follow LCES, and conduct operations with an open eye to recognize changing weather conditions, increasing fire behavior, and most of all personnel well being.

2.	Make sure that helispots are examined by the Helibase Manager or other air operations personnel. On incidents, the Air Operations Director is responsible for the establishment of all helispots, though this responsibility may be delegated to the Air Support Group Supervisor or Helibase Manager. On projects without a full air staff, the Helibase Manager has the responsibility. Before helitack are dropped off at a helispot, don't be afraid to fly around and do a good aerial recon to make sure you feel comfortable getting off.

3.	Helitack personnel that are assigned to helispots need to access the mission at hand. Assessing risk identifies any hazards, a decision to conduct a mission requires weighing the risk against the benefit of the mission. (Risk Assessment and Risk Management)

a)	Identify hazards associated with all specified and implied tasks of the mission.

b)	Access hazards

c)	Develop controls to mitigate or remove risk; this may be as simple as identifying trigger points.

d)	Implement controls

e)	Supervise and evaluate – enforce standards and continuously re-evaluate their effectiveness in reducing or removing risk. Ensure that controls are communicated, implemented, and enforced.

4. If possible, when staffing helispots, make sure one person is a Helispot Manager. Although, there is no task book for a Helispot Manager, there needs to be some qualifications tied to this position. This is critical, if helitack are going to be out on a helispot and need to fend for themselves.    First of all, I took a good look at the situation at hand, walking around trying to identify good safety zones, establish communication, and identify some simple trigger points. I decided if the fire advanced to a certain position on the slope that I would vacate the helispot. I called Air Attack to make sure he knew that the helispot was staffed, and if he could-keep an eye open for us. At this time, Operations called Air Attack and requested that we be flown off of the helispot. I called Air Attack again to verify that we were going to be flown off. In this case, we were going to be flown back to the helibase. Nevertheless, in any situation, don't rely on getting a flight out of a helispot, I identified what we were going to do if we had to hike out of the helispot, in case the smoke, fire, or other factors wouldn't allow the helicopter to land on the helispot.

1.	Tactics based on expected fire behavior is a prime requirement before engaging a wildland fire. I ran through some different scenarios in my mind guessing what the fire was going to do and how that could hamper our current location at the helispot.

2.	The overhead and firefighters need to establish tools to enable them to accurately assess the fire situation and make good tactical decisions. Granted, experience will play a big role in this endeavor, when in doubt, don't be afraid to get a hold of someone who may have a better idea on what the fire could do regarding fire behavior.

3.	“A big picture view” of the fire’s signature needs to be taken seriously. The alignment of forces for a location and use the fire signature of a like alignment to develop an understanding of what the fire behavior will be like in that location. In simple terms, playing the 'What if' game.

4.	Considering where the most fire activity took place, which was a north slope, the time frame in which a northern aspect will be susceptible to erratic fire behavior is between 0800 and 1200. This insight led me to believe that fire conditions could worsen, which was pertinent to make sure that if the time came, that nothing on helispot was worth staying for.

5.	The Nuttall drainage was in full alignment with wind, slope and to a certain degree extent solar preheating. Leading to an increase in unexpected fire behavior compared to previous burn days on the fire. This fire behavior was a surprise to everyone, don't rely on past fire behavior on previous burn days.

The first resources were a load of smokejumpers and several local agency engines. Once the incident commander (IC) assessed the fire he ordered additional resources. All communications at that point was effective and we were communicating clearly with the IC on the local repeaters Gerlach and Star Peak. The resources bedded down at approx midnight. Upon waking this morning the IC was attempting contact with dispatch and with almost every transmission on the Gerlach and Star Peak repeaters there was feed back lasting for approximately 3-7 minutes. Each repeater was giving off different feedback noises. The assistant center manager informed the local communications technician at 0700 of the problem. The com tech stated that he was aware of the problem and in fact had been listening to it. Within the hour the com tech arrived at the dispatch office. He advised the manager that a local internet business had set up a high wattage item that was causing the interference. He stated that business had been contacted and the problem was being rectified. The com tech proceed to monitor the traffic for a couple hours from dispatch and then proclaimed that the interference may be caused by atmospheric conditions. He stated these conditions were unavoidable. Once the business had shut down the high wattage item he departed dispatch, he informed the manager and staff that the repeaters were fixed and no longer should the interference occur. In reality this problem only intensified over the course of the day. The IC ended up sending air resources to this fire. We were able to do some sporadic communication on the local repeaters and were also able to utilize National Flight Following. While this is a quick fix, the problem there in lies that National Flight Following cannot be utilized at low altitudes. Hence making it ineffective upon takeoff and landing.

At 1400 there was a transition of incident commanders. The transitioning incident commander attempted to make contact with dispatch on the Gerlach repeater over 5 times. These attempts proved ineffective so the IC proceeded to go into Empire and call dispatch on a pay phone to get an update. The phone call was cut short due to the IC not having enough change. Dispatch relayed a toll free number to the center that the IC could utilize. Please note* due to the remote location of this incident no cellular coverage was available to the fire resources.

At approximately 1500 the CNIDC manager contacted the com tech again relaying that the problem was persisting. At that point the com tech suggested the manager contact all military entities with in a 200 mile radius to see if it was possible they were somehow interfering with our repeaters. Upon direction from the local fire management officer no calls to the military were made. At this point the manager informed the fire management officer that he would be filling a SAFENET on this incident and the fire management officer agreed this was a good course of action.

At 1651 the manager debriefed the initial IC. He verified that the communications with dispatch last night were clear and this morning they were not only unclear but affecting the entire operation. The only frequency the resources on scene could utilize effectively was the scene of action frequency. He added that due to the spread out nature of the fire resources more frequencies needed to be utilized in order for LCES to be met. He also feels the lack of radio communication warrants a SAFENET.","Every incident commander should carry a satellite phone.    Initially the manager contacted the com tech to repair the radio system. Next we expressed to the fire to set up a human repeater with a cell phone or at the pay phone to establish communication with us. It was determined that was impossible because from the location of the pay phone and in which cellular coverage was available, the scene of action frequency could not be utilized. We sent J-59, who was in route to the Empire airport anyway to extract jumpers, early to deliver a satellite phone to the incident commander.","07/01/2004 00:00"

At a morning briefing, firefighters were told that there is a problem with too much volume transmitted into the repeaters. Those with wideband radios were advised to speak softer or hold the radio further from the mouth when transmitting into the repeaters.

I would estimate that almost 75% of the King handhelds I cloned that were brought by personnel (mostly Forest Service) were wideband only (King LPH, MPH, early EPH).

After transmitting, instead of hearing the usual 'kerchunk' from the repeater indicating successful transmission, the repeater began a tumultuous, robotic cacophony that lasted for several minutes. I transmitted to the repeater several times in an unsuccessful effort to make it stop. It eventually did after an arbitrary period of time. Later attempts to use the Gerlach repeater brought the same result, although I eventually learned that I could successfully transmit and receive with dispatch through the noise. That, in addition to the foresight of bringing a satellite phone, made communications with dispatch possible. That problem with Gerlach repeater continues today.

At least two other repeaters on the district have been affected. Star Peak repeater has been 'sticking' in similar fashion. When someone transmits on that or the Gerlach repeater, the ruckus ensues for anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. The Winnemucca Mountain repeater does not stick, but traffic seems to be disrupted on Winnemucca Mountain as well in that only portions of any given transmission are readable when another repeater is sticking. I imagine this is common to every repeater on district. The result is that field resources and dispatch are missing each other's traffic somewhat regularly.

The Engine Module Supervisor was not able to communicate to the Field Office or to the Dispatch Center via radio and mitigated the situation by communicating with a cell/satellite phone.

A request has been made to the Wyoming BLM State Telecommunications Group, in Lander, to provide a detailed training opportunity to ensure competency on their use and programming for all firefighters within the Zone Fire Management Program as well as to schedule an annual radio-training course to the Zone. It has also been formally requested that each new EF Johnson mobile radio be checked to ensure proper programming and frequency data within each group.

There appears to be a safety issue at the home unit of the busses. All three bus operators said they had been inspected prior to arriving at the incident. None of the operators produced a copy of the inspection. It is my understanding that these busses transported firefighters to the ICP.

Two busses were owned by P. Lupe with a company name of The Hot Spot. The male operator of one the busses stated the bus had been inspected in White River. The operator alluded that the inspector just made marks on the inspection sheet instead of giving the bus a thorough inspection. When describing it to me he gestured as if someone was making quick check marks down a page. One of the Hot Spot busses had severe brake problems and the other had a severe steering linkage problem.

The third bus was owned by L.C.Express. The operator stated that the bus was inspected in San Carlos. This bus failed the ICP inspection because the Pitman Arm has a groove worn 3 inches long the width of the bolt it was rubbing on. It appears that a bolt associated with an air tank was improperly replaced at some point in time in such a manner that it rubs on the Pittman Arm. The Pittman Arm travels as the steering is operated. During this travel, it rubbed against a bolt and will soon cut through the Pittman Arm.

All three of these busses had other issues that were not as serious. It appears that an inspection situation exists on the White River and San Carlos Reservation that places their fire fighters in extremely unsafe vehicles. It is second hand information that we have from the bus operators about what was inspected and where, prior to the arrival at the ICP. There was no documentation prior to arrival at the ICP.","1. All busses need to be re-inspected upon arrival at fire camp. 'Qualified' mechanics are present at these locations who can make the determination if the vehicles meet current D.O.T. (Department of Transportation) safety standards.

2. Local agencies need to be made aware that not everyone is skilled in the inspection of these types of rigs. It pays many times over to have these type vehicles inspected by a 'qualified' mechanic versus the cost of accidents or claims. The inspections can be done thru a local vendor such as a mechanic shop or by utilization of nearby resources such as 'Fleet Managers' assigned to other agencies.

3. The attitude of 'getting the crews out” or 'utilizing local resources (bus vendors)' should not be the determining factor as was in all 3 cases above.

4. All busses assigned to the above named Contractors should receive inspections prior to any future dispatches to head off possible problems.

Since the inception of the pack test in, I believe 1998, there have been 10 fatalities that are associated with folks training for or taking this test.  The most recent involving a gentleman by the name of Larry Hoffman, 51 years old, with the Oregon Dept. of Forestry.  Based on this, I think it is time to at least re-think and review the Work Capacity Test, to insure it is the most reasonable and realistic test we can give our folks who are planning on being involved in wildfire work.  I have always thought that the pack test was a much better test that the previous 'step test', because it provides a more realistic test under conditions that somewhat stress or test one's ability to move quickly with a pack on your back, in a time frame that may at least mimic what could be experienced in a wildfire situation.

I have always asked myself, why are we taking this test with 45 lbs?  The average firefighter normally carries about 30-35 lbs of line gear.  This would include a pack, fire shelter, 3-4 qts water, lunch, radio, and other misc. gear.  Some hotshot folks may carry as much as 40 lbs of line gear or more if carrying a chain saw, gas and oil.  Most hotshot crews have their own minimum physical fitness requirements for hiring folks. My suggestion is to seriously consider limiting the amount of weight to about 35 lbs for the test amount carried, require folks to test in their fire boots, instead of other footgear that is not worn on the fire line.  I think the rest of the test is pretty good, i.e. 3 miles in about 45 minutes.  I just think we are putting unnecessary stress on folks by requiring them to carry 45 lbs at the pace of about 45 minutes and covering 3 miles.  I think it is time to review this test and possibly bring it back to more of a realistic situation.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this.  FYI, my current experience and background include being a Safety Officer assigned to a Type 2 Eastern Great Basin Incident Management Team.  My other Red Card qualifications include ICT3 and DIVS.  I have about 25 years of various wildfire experience behind me.","I think I have covered my suggested review in the above narrative.

I was able to receive radio transmissions from the zone dispatch office, lookouts, and the local ranger district office, but was unable to talk to anyone on the repeater frequencies utilizing my BLM issued radios. I had to relay through the lookouts utilizing the direct (non-repeating) frequency, but communications with them was still spotty at best. On more than one occasion, I was within 2 miles, line-of-sight with the local ranger district office and could not communicate with them. The Raycal radio was particularly bad about transmitting any distance, but was better at receiving radio traffic than the EF Johnson mobile.

I finally was able to checkout a Bendix-King handheld radio from the local district office that was a little more functional, but not much.

-Scanning problems.  While scanning, we pick up several channels that we did not select for our scan list. These channels would completely override the radios, not allowing desired traffic to come through.  These channels were not picking up other traffic, but just coming over as static or squealing.  We were told to hold down the scan button when this happened and it would delete the channel from scanning.  This was only a temporary fix, usually less than two minutes and the channel would come back up again.  After holding the scan button down to delete the undesired channel, another would come up.  Often as many as 15 to 20 other channels, so you would find yourself spending several minutes deleting these channels only to have them come up again in a couple of minutes.  Many of the guys on my crew quit scanning because they could hear none of their desired channels otherwise.  This is a problem due to multiple agencies and aircraft; we need to be able to scan several channels.

-Short battery life.  Batteries seldom last more than 5 or 6 hours when you are using them heavily.  We have no clamshells for these radios and it takes some time to stop what you are doing and dig batteries out of your pack.

-Radios would stop working.  Just out of the blue the radios would stop transmitting and receiving.  The only warning we have of this problem is if we hear traffic coming from someone else’s radio.  To fix this you must power down the radio and turn it back on.  Before you realize this you may be offline for 20 to 30 minutes.

-Channels change too easily.  Due to the large channel selection knob and the inability to scan, your radio easily gets switched to a channel you are not supposed to be operating on while working, missing any and all radio traffic until you check your radio.

-Poor receiving.  Often times I could not receive any traffic unless I have the radio facing the direction of the person talking.  During this fire, most ground forces were less than a 1/3 of a mile from one another.

-Volume knob.  The volume knob just slides into place.  While working in brush, we have lost volume knobs.

-Low volume.  Even when I have the volume turned all the way up on these radios, it’s hard to hear any traffic unless you have radio up by your face or ear.  This is really a problem if you have any background noise, which we often do.

-No keypad lock.  We cannot lock our keypad, so we are constantly hitting buttons changing the PL tones or switching zones.

All the problems listed above are things we have encountered with all 4 EF Johnson radios on our engine.  It makes it hard to do a simple job like tell one of my guys to bump up to our location.  Often I find myself walking up and down the line and telling them face to face after I fail to contact them by radio.","We will be switching back to our King radios until we can get these problems fixed.    We had to stay with someone that had a different radio so we could hear what was going on.

From that point on, no other resource could contact dispatch on the Delle repeater.  Resources could talk to each other using the Delle repeater, but dispatch could not transmit or receive radio traffic on the Delle repeater.","Once the problem with the radio transmissions between dispatch and the demobilizing resource was identified it was relayed to the Duty Officer via cell phone.  The Duty officer then informed the demobing resources.  He used the Delle repeater to contact all resources.  The action that was taken was to contact dispatch by using cell phones, which fortunately all demobing resources had.

If this problem occurred during the actual fire operations, we could have run ground resources, however it might have impeded on our air operations, i.e. flight following, and aircraft would probably have been grounded.  Also it would have complicated communication between dispatch and the IC, which could be big problem in future incidents, because there are some areas that have poor or no cell service.    At 2330 all demobing resources knew that radio transmissions between dispatch and themselves using the Delle repeater was not working.  The information to use cell phones was passed along to all demobing resources.  On the NUIFC side of things, radio techs were notified and responded to NUIFC to help locate and fix the problem.

The problem was located and fixed the next day.  There seemed to be a problem with the Delle repeater base station itself.

A very strong concern I have fostered for a very long time (especially since the Storm King Mountain fatalities) is that, in my mind, the sole person/s who could have changed the entire outcome of these events (and likely many others!) have been those of the Pilots, Aviators, and other human resources committed to the skies.

In both these scenarios - there was absolutely no more than a mention of the 'role' these people played in recognizing the hazards early on.  But yet they were key players!!  To the trained and concerned firefighter’s eye ...  the writing was virtually 'in the drainage' as to the fatal possibilities.  Why have we continued to overlook and negate the role that these airborne people CAN play in the safety of every single person on an incident??  Why would someone flying air attack or providing service in an aerial platform NOT put a visible risk to people on the ground as the utmost priority??  Because...they are NOT trained or expected to do so.

I strongly feel herein lies a potential opportunity for positive changes in the roles and priorities of airborne personnel.  All air operations could/should be put on a temp hold until all assurances are made for the ultimate best size-up and relay of important fire behavior changes to the ground crews/IC, -- when initial changes are noted.  Our ASM personal, HELCOs and AAs are the best and most effective SAFETY Officers on a fire and they should be trained and expected to perform such duties above all other operational missions.  If we are asking too much of our eyes in the sky - then maybe this is a place to put our Safety Officers.  The big picture is imperative and they should be directly connected to their IC at all times.","As a fire manager in Alaska I have strongly supported at least basic fire behavior to be a set curriculum for all of our IA and CWN Helicopter pilots.  If the vendors are unable to support the program through their in-house training - I would offer to sponsor the training or it would be initiated at the local area immediately upon check in of a pilot.  With these recommendations - ERA Helicopters now sponsors a fire school annually in Feno for its pilots and does teach them about Fire Behavior (and ICS)!  I find this commendable and a good role model for other vendors.  This same training is not an unreasonable expectation for FW Pilots and, from my dialogs with many, they are more than happy to do whatever they can to do a better job for the firefighters.  Granted 'they have an important job to do' but as they scan the scene providing for their own safety - the ability to 'recognize' a true or potential hazard does not distract greatly from flying.

Also, by transferring our hopes and expectation verbally to the air community through briefings, training and debriefings we enable the watchful individuals to do/be more -- while commending them for filling key roles essential to the safety of all firefighters.  Job description for AA, HELCOs, ASMs and any others should be modified with a primary responsibility 'to provide the most current assessments of fire behavior and fire location to the ground crews at all costs and at all times'.  'Providing for Firefighter Safety is Everybody’s Job, all the Time'!   Being Mission orientated is almost a watch-out situation - even in the sky.    I have personally tried to institute changes in prerequisite training and offer advanced fire behavior training to all aviation vendors within my regional sphere of influence.  All pilots who contract in fire management operations should be able to recognize, name, describe and hopefully interpret the gross fire behavior visible from their platform, and equally assess the factors of wx, wind, and terrain on these scenarios.  If this is unreasonable, a stronger responsibility to report and assess lone smokes (spot fires) would even be helpful. Understanding the possibilities, integrating and speaking the 'language' are key goals.

To support fire behavior comprehension with the pilots, the training budget at our District procured a set of fire behavior for each vendor, as well as other videos such as the professional fire helicopter pilot, Tactics in the Wildland Urban interface, fire whirls and Extreme Fire Behavior.  We made our firefighters available to led instruction sessions, facilitate videos, and visit vendors during pre-season refreshers. In Alaska - the Chief Pilots, Exclusive-Use Pilots, and CWN pilots are all invited to the Annual Helicopter Refresher/WS so that we may foster that 'personal connection' from the ground up.  We all work together to learn from last year’s mistakes and solve problems as a working group. Personally, I have never yet met a pilot or a sincere FFTR who didn't want to learn more about fire. The obsession is usually mutual.

Thank you for providing a forum on safety - I feel better:)","06/02/2004 00:00"

The road was two-track with heavy grass & moderate to heavy brush with numerous large oak trees.  Cedar Brook Creek is located on the East side of the two-track road.  The original fire was approximately 1/2 mile north of paved county road on east side of Cedar Brook Creek.  The first engine on scene was instructed to make initial attack on the fire via the two-track road.  After a few minutes, the local hotshot crew arrived on scene and was directed to assist the engine crew on the fire east of the road.  As the crew was deploying on the fire, the superintendent noticed a second start on the West side of the road, approximately 300 yards South of the original fire toward the ridge top.  The superintendent advised me of the new start and that he believed someone was lighting additional fires.  The heavy grass in the fire area was not completely cured which resulted in a large volume of smoke and slow to moderate rates of spread in the grass.  When the second engine arrived on scene they were advised to make initial attack on the second fire.  As the engine captain and firefighters neared the lower edge of the fire the captain sized up the fire at 1/4 acre and instructed his crew to attack both flanks with the hose lay, one firefighter to the left and one to the right.  As the firefighter on the left flank began his attack a loud pop was heard and the firefighter was knocked to the ground.  As the firefighter and the captain assessed the situation they realized the firefighter had stepped on or near a live power line.  Prior to this time no one on the incident had observed the power line.  The power line was not easily visible from the road into the incident.  Additionally the power line and pole in the incident area were not visible from the location of the engine.  The power line at the accident site was hidden in the trees and brush as well as quite camouflaged in the burn area.  The injuries received by the firefighter were minor and he was moved to the engine to await transport to the hospital by ambulance.

During this incident we have had two instances that raise a heads-up to the way we do business with trailers.

Our first incident involved a privately owned horse trailer delivering supplies to fire camp.  The trailer arrived with the brake safety cable detached.  This cable is important because it locks the trailer brakes if the trailer should become disconnected from the tow vehicle. This is also an ADOT requirement for towed trailers over a certain GVW.

The second incident was with a burn trailer deliver to fire camp to support firing operations.  This trailer was a converted military 1/4-ton trailer with a pintel hitch.  The trailer had no operable lights, light connections, or safety chain.  It was also leaking fuel through its vent cap.  This vehicle was a Forest Service owned trailer.

While we often focus on fireline safety with personnel, we often overlook the safety of the vehicles we utilize. Both the above incidents indicate a lack of attention to vehicle safety of both our contract vehicles and government property in a rush to get the job done.","Apply agency safety standards unilaterally to our own equipment and those of our contactors.

A local-use radio repeater located on an adjacent mountaintop, which normally provides a key radio link to this area of the Forest, was not functioning to full capacity. Communications between incident helibase (aerial ignition operations), incident personnel (holding, patrol, air and ground support) and the central dispatch center was not adequate for safe, efficient incident operations as a result. Safety issue was mitigated by helicopter placement of a human repeater at a location to provide a radio link between all resources and dispatch. A 'go' decision was made for the prescribed burn and all operations were conducted safely and successfully.

The situation with substandard radio repeater performance at this location is a recurring problem related with equipment maintenance and companion issue of its location at a historic site. The radio equipment is housed in an old fire lookout building (unstaffed for many years) that is National Register eligible for listing. The building has become rodent infested, which requires decontamination, and/or other protective measures for prevention of potential hantavirus exposure every time personnel need to access equipment for maintenance.

Backlog and heavy workload for the Heritage Resource Program on the Forest has delayed site evaluation and required clearance to place an alternative structure at this mountaintop site to house, secure essential radio equipment while preventing rodent intrusion.","Current radio repeater site has no feasible alternative locations to provide the area of coverage needed. A suitable prefab structure is available, on-hand for placement at the site for permanent relocation of radio equipment.

When he explained to the doctor that the Forest Service (FS) doesn’t require that sort of system on their engines, he stated that all municipal city and county agencies require their engines to do so as per OSHA standards. The doctor also wrote a letter for my captain's supervisor stating that my captain needed to have this equipment to save what hearing he had left.

My captain notified his BC of what the doctor had informed him of and recommended, the BC requested that he gather some research regarding OSHA and other safety standards & headset/intercom systems. After researching this information, we discovered the following:

1. OSHA 4-page fact sheet on hearing protection

2. OSHA document 3074, hearing conservation

3. 'Listen up' EMS article by Marie Nordberg EMS Associate Editor

4. Brochure regarding NFPA approved Headsets & intercom systems

Some of this information included permissible noise level exposures per 1/4 hour; safety benefits of intercom & headset usage, and new info regarding employers to compensate employees who have work related hearing loss. (My captain has record from the last eight years showing gradual hearing loss).

On June 8th after receiving this info, the BC gave this information to the DC due to the seriousness of the situation. The captain must be able to receive info in the engine while in route to an emergency going code - 3 with engine noise. He also must receive pertinent info to pass along to the crew for safety reasons. Having this system would benefit the captain as well as preserve what hearing he has left. Also having this system would help the rest of the crew and protect them from hearing loss. According to the BC, he sent this info in a formal letter with a return receipt via e - mail as well as a hard copy to his desk. Nothing was received either face to face or e-mail to resolve this matter. A lot of internal mail has been passed around to others but with no resolve.

The BC was then asked by the District Ranger to send him a Formal letter (which he had previously done with a return receipt) to deal with this.

It is now 8/05 and still nothing has been done. FED OSHA was notified by others about what had been happening and of the actions of the District Ranger and DC. The FED OSHA rep stated that their lack of action on this matter would justify the captain to file a complaint.

When we were at Daniels MT-4 Digital Radio training, I brought it up and the instructor gave us a demonstration that when deviation gets to be more than 4.2 KHz the audio shuts down.  This is due to the way the Motorola chip processes voice, discussion brought up that Motorola digital radios start to do this at around 3.75 KHz.

Narrow band analog has a voice modulation of 2.5 KHz voice plus tone.  Wideband analog radios are set for a modulation of 4.5 KHz +/- 500 Hz voice plus tone.

When I was messing with a MT-4 Daniels repeater here at the shop, it shut off audio at about 4.0 KHz with a 1KHz tone.  Using a handheld radio I was able to get it to shut down, but it also has a really fast recovery time.  It starts sounding metallic and distorted until the repeater audio shuts down.  I could see on the O-scope where it was shutting down and coming back.

When people get excited they have a tendency to talk louder which would further aggravate the situation and no audio would be heard.

There is no distortion when deviation exceeds what the Motorola chip can handle because there is no audio. The older narrowband RPTRs did not have this problem due to not having the digital chip in it.

In reading some recent SAFENETs, this sounds like what the users are experiencing and not knowing what is going on.  All they know is some communications get through sounding bad and some do not.

Here is some technical info a co-worker came up with.

My own voice modulating a King EPH5992A wide-band handheld does not reliably come through the Daniels MT-4 narrow-band repeater.  When I speak loudly the audio is completely blocked.  When I speak in a medium voice the audio blanks out multiple words.  When I speak softly the audio comes through with just a little bit of distortion.

I injected a -90 dBm RF signal into the Daniels MT-4 narrow-band receiver.  I modulated the signal with a 136.5 Hz tone to 0.75 kHz deviation in addition to the test tones.

With a 500 Hz test tone, the distortion was 17% when the deviation was 3.6 kHz.  When the deviation was increased to 3.7 kHz, the receiver squelched.  The receiver didn't unsquelch again until the deviation was reduced to 3.1 kHz, at which point the distortion was 6.5%.

With a 1000 Hz test tone the distortion was 7% when the deviation was 3.8 kHz.  When the deviation was increased to 3.9 kHz, the receiver squelched.  The receiver didn't unsquelch again until the deviation was reduced to 3.2 kHz, at which point the distortion was 6.5%.

With a 1500 Hz test tone the distortion was 7% when the deviation was 3.9 kHz.  When the deviation was increased to 4.0 kHz, the receiver squelched.  The receiver didn't unsquelch again until the deviation was reduced to 3.4 kHz, at which point the distortion was 6.5%.","Declare wideband analog radios not approved for Federal fire use.

Get the contract writers to amend that radios need to be narrow band analog capable.  At least by January 2005, should have been for the 2003 season.

I know it is drastic, but there is a big problem in the way the Motorola chip in the Digital/Narrowband Analog radios handle more modulation than they are designed for.    Declare wideband analog radios not approved for Federal fire use.

One of the students prompted the action, after sharing that they opened one at a district meeting about a month ago and the thing 'ripped open while they were shaking it out”.  After opening the shelter and giving it a moderate shake, the seam of the shelter on the inside of the left hand handle ripped open about four inches.  We felt if someone was in the adrenaline mode it would have ripped much more.  After one of the medium sized students got in the shelter, the left arm strap also tore out of the shelter.

Other than that, these shelters are awesomely designed.  (I deployed in an old shelter in 94' and would have loved to have one of these.)  I would suggest continuing to get them out as scheduled because, even with the faulty workmanship, they would save lives.  (They most definitely, in my opinion, would have saved the lives of the Thirtymile fatalities.)  I would contact the company about the problem so that they may fix it, two out of two should send up a red flag. 

What I would also recommend is that the company sends replacements for all of the ones sold already and that the originals be tested or used as training shelters.  Please let us know what action you will take here, this is important to us.","","03/18/2004 00:00"

WILDFIRE","AR/OUF/004","AR","USFS","Caddo R.D.","Firefighter","Line Construction","3","Dozer","Wildland;","Line;","Initial Attack;","Equipment;Environmental;","","","The Dozer operator was establishing an indirect fireline along an old road that lay mid-slope below the fire. The old road was approximately a quarter of a mile long.  When it ended, the operator turned the dozer so it was backing up hill and proceeded to maneuver up a steep slope (35 % +).  The dozer operator felt comfortable with his ability and the capability of the D-6 on this kind of slope, having a lot of experience with working liked slopes.  A swamper worked with the dozer operator in picking out the best route to walk the dozer up the slope.  Several times during the process they stopped the dozer and had the operator get out to confirm the best route.  The swamper and operator worked together to walk the dozer around some ledges to keep the dozer in a safe place.  The dozer made it approximately 1100 ft. up the slope to where it started to flatten out toward the top.  The slope at this point was 15-20 %.  The time was approximately 1630 and it was decided to start plowing line along this side slope.  The dozer operator told his swamper that he would bench out the line so the dozer would stay near level.  This was done to prevent a turn over.  The dozer operator had just begun to plow when he pulled out three 2 ft x 3 ft. rocks.  He could see the top of another rock on his right side.  The rock in front of him looked just like the ones he had just dug up.  This round rock was on the down hillside of the dozer and was approximately 4 ft from the dozer.  At this point, the operator backed the dozer up to sweep the 3 large rocks over to the right side (down the hillside).  This was done to keep the rocks and dirt from leaning the dozer down hill.  As he began to move forward to sweep the rocks over, he felt the track slip and suddenly the dozer was standing on its rear, almost straight up and down and slightly leaning down hill.  Due to limited vision caused by the enclosed cap the operator had not seen the rock that could have caused this predicament.  Slowly the dozer lay over on its right side. The dozer operator could not reach the key but he could reach the throttle, he pushed the throttle all the way forward to slow the engines rpms, after which he released his seat belt so he could turn the engine off.  By the time he straightened up to turn the key off the engine killed itself.  The operator flashed a thumbs up sign to the swamper to let him know he was ok.  The dozer operator proceeded to leave the dozer through the left door, which was, at this point, over his head since the dozer was on its right side.  It took a few seconds to get the door catch to work so the operator could get out.  Once the door was open, the swamper used a rake handle to hold the door open while the operator got out.  Even though the dozer was away from the fire, a hand line was put in around it and then a tanker drop was requested to reinforce a drop early that day to ensure its safety.

The swamper and dozer operator discussed the incident to determine what exactly had caused the incident. It was determine that the rock the operator had seen right in front of him before the incident was actually a rock ledge.  Also, it was determined that one of the rocks that was being swept away had gotten under the dozer’s track.  When the dozer was on top of said rock, the rock ledge was underneath the rock.  The loose rock teetered on the rock ledge and threw the dozer off on the down hill side.  The dozer was in a forward motion when this happened and when the dozer was thrown the tracks caught the top of the ledge where the track slid over the ledge.  This put the dozer setting on its rear.  At this point, the dozer slowly fell on its right side. The visibility and the weight of the dozer was a major factor in the incident.  The operator could not see the ledge or the rock that got caught between the dozer and ledge.  After the dozer slipped, the weight of the dozer took over and the dozer laid over on its right side.","We resolved the situation by securing the dozer during over night with a tanker drop to establish a line around it.  The next day, another D-6 and 450 dozer were used to up-right the dozer. In the future, we would take more time to scout out line placement while maneuvering the dozer up a steep slope.  We will make sure the operator has a good view of what is going on.  This may be accomplished by having the operator get off the dozer to inspect the line to be plowed.","03/18/2004 00:00"

I was instructed by my Squad Boss that we were going to fire out around two plantations before the helicopter arrived to fire the area using an aerial PSD (ping-pong) device.  My Squad Boss informed me that he was going to fire around the plantation that was down wind and I was to fire the plantation upwind from him.  Just before we started lighting, a crew that was a quarter of a mile away, down wind from us, was trying to fire off a perimeter line but were having complications with a spot fire.  A dozer and a 4-wheeler, that were assigned to that area, responded to the spot.  I informed my Squad Boss that we would be sending a head fire to the engine crew with the spot, but I was then informed that we were to continue lighting off around the plantations before the helicopter arrived.  We proceeded to fire out the plantations.  After proceeding about a quarter of the way around, spot fires were discovered behind me.  I immediately contacted my Squad Boss that I was going to stop firing.  The spot fires were reported to the burn boss, and he instructed us to keep firing.  The winds were coming from the North, North West at the time but were variable at around 8-10 miles per hour.  I was burning in flashy Yopine, tall grass, and intermittent immature pine clusters.  The 4-wheeler and dozer operator proceeded to attack the new spot fires.  The 4-wheeler operator then contacted me and asked me to hold up because they were getting to many spots, so I quit firing.  It was at that time that I heard the helicopter flying towards me, but I heard the helicopter manager state over the radio that they were firing in a different area.  It was then that I proceeded on down the line to scout out the fuels and dozer line to see if it could hold before I lit.  I was then told to continue firing by the 4-wheeler operator because they had caught the spots.  I proceeded on with my line and met with the dozer operator who had bumped around.  At this time the helicopter flew over me unannounced and dropped ping-pong balls about 50 feet from the dozer line up wind from me.  The fuels ignited immediately and spread rapidly towards the dozer line.  At this time I rushed to try and lay some fire down to get some black to reinforce my dozer line and to slow down the head fire that was headed towards me.  I then heard the dozer operator say over the radio that he had picked up another spot and was attacking it behind me.  I came around a corner and noticed that the fire ahead of me, from the ping-pong balls, had already spread to the dozer line and was now laying flame across my dozer line, cutting off my access out that way.  I then turned around to go back to some good black, only to find the fire had spotted over the road behind me as well.  At this time I tried to notify my Squad Boss about my situation but was unable to contact him due to all the radio traffic about the spot fires.  The 4-wheeler operator heard some of my traffic, and was able to spray some water on the fire in front of me to cool it down enough for me to get through.  He then was able to break through the radio traffic and inform me that I had an escape route.  I proceeded out to the road.","There needed to be communication between the helicopter and ignition specialist to insure that areas are safe to fire in and that everyone was out to safe areas.  I was never notified that the helicopter was coming my way.  It was pertinent in this situation that all personnel that were interior needed to be out to a safety zone before the helicopter fired off the area.  We needed more than 1 tac channel.  We were given only 1 tac channel for the day and it was extremely difficult to reach someone with all the traffic.    I spoke with the AFMO who was in the helicopter and the FMO who were the Burn Boss and Ignitions for the RX upon completion of the burn from the day.  I also brought up my concerns about the communication problems, spot fires, and no warning of the helicopter lighting off in my area at the after action review.

After voicing my concerns, I was assured that adjustments and changes would be made to ensure everyone's safety on future prescribed fires.","03/11/2004 00:00"

Zone Fmo","Committee Member","2","All","Training;","Readiness/Preparedness;","Other;","Human Factors;","Decision Making;Leadership;Risk Assessment;","Failure to follow agency redcard qualification policy","I am an Asst Zone FMO on the Eleven Point District of the Mark Twain National Forest.  I recently attended a red card committee meeting and brought up a number of issues concerning non-compliance with our policy pertaining to red card quals and 5109.17.  An example is the requirement under 5109.17, p.4 of 109, requiring instructor training for USFS lead and unit instructors at the 200 level courses and above. Our Forest is quite aware of this requirement, yet continues to allow instructors that do not meet the requirement to instruct.

A non-compliance with policy issue that has frustrated red card committee members for the past 4 months involves an individual who has come to our Forest from the state of North Carolina.  This individual claimed numerous upper level ICS qualifications upon arrival.  The Forest qualified the individual in numerous positions including DIVS.  I understand our policy of honoring existing red card qualifications for newly hired USFS employees coming to us from other agencies.  However, the problem is documentation was never provided for these upper level ICS positions.  This individual talked himself into getting these qualifications on his card without anyone following the certification and record keeping requirements of 5109.17, p. 10 of 109.

These quals were questioned for a couple of years.  In Feb of 2004, I requested that the red card committee review this individual's quals. They finally did and determined that no documentation existed for qualification above CRWB.  The emergency red card committee did a rather exhaustive review and recommended the qualifications be de-certified back to the CRWB level.  The individual’s immediate supervisor contacted the individual’s previous supervisor and other contacts in NC.  The supervisor was unable to document any qualification above CRWB prior to arriving on the Mark Twain NF in Nov. 2001.  The individual’s NC supervisor confirmed only one 'unsatisfactory' CRWB assignment as the highest level of the individual’s quals.  The individual filled out a handwritten qualification and experience record in his own words, documenting nothing higher than CRWB through Oct. 2000, consistent with his immediate supervisor from NC.  When the individual started on the Mark Twain NF in Nov 2001, he claimed DIVS, STEN, STCR, STDZ, ICT3, HECM, and more.  The problem is basic.  It is impossible to reach DIVS level in only one western fire season, 2001, starting from 1 CRWB assignment in Oct 2000.  In addition, the individual claimed 32 strike team leader assignments in all three areas:  crews, engines, and dozers.  The individual also claimed to be HECM and worked 3 seasons with the Region 9 contracted helicopter, before he was determined unqualified for not having acquired the red card qualification.  He also claimed to be RXB2, until the committee determined he never had the qualification.

The issue is this, 5109.17 requires a hardcopy file of documentation be maintained for each red carded individual in our agency, p.10 of 109.  The emergency red card committee stepped up to the plate when this issue was brought to their attention and they did the right thing.  They recommended the qualifications be set back to the level that documentation exists per our policy.  They did an exhaustive review of this case and made the right call.  When the individual was notified of the de-certification, he went to the Forest Supervisor with his grievance.  The Forest Supervisor reviewed the information and re-instated the individual’s quals. The response given to a red card committee member, who resigned from the committee over disgust with the quals reinstatement, was that the responsibility for any potential consequences of the reinstatement was the Forest Supervisor's.  The response also included that the Forest Supervisor was privy to documentation that the committee was not, hence the reinstatement.

My concern is this:  Qualifications are a serious safety issue, since the human element in fireline situations far outweigh such things as PPE.  It is critical that folks making the decisions are qualified following our agency policies.

I have worked all channels I can imagine within the district, zone, and forest levels to resolve this matter to no avail.  I am our district's safety officer, so I find this issue particularly troubling. I have recently requested the new documentation that the Forest Supervisor used in his determination for reinstatement from our Forest Fire Management Officer.  I have not had any response in 2 and a half weeks.  I asked the Forest Fire Management Officer on behalf of the Asst. Zone FMOs across the Forest to meet with us and iron out numerous red card quals issues including case outlined above.  I got no response.

I believe it is the right of any firefighter to be provided documentation of quals of anyone if there is a question of safety.  5109.17 requires that the paper trail and hardcopy documentation be filed and maintained.  I would like to see it, as would the red card committee as it pertains to the qualifications reinstatement of the individual outlined above.  I feel this is our right and the responsibility of any certifying official.

I would greatly appreciate a timely response, since fire season will soon find us all off and heading west. Please contact members of the red card committee in resolving this matter, Rick Moon 417-683-4428, Chris Woods 573-438-5427, Reggie Bray 417-967-4194, Tim Bray 573-729-6656, Scott Bashaw 573-785-1475, Jerry Soard 573-729-6656, Ben Wyatt 573-996-2153.","Strongly encourage the Mark Twain National Forest to follow its agency policies consistently with regard to fire and aviation qualifications.  Compliance is not optional, no Forest or individual is above our agency policies.  Require policy training for all fire management positions and certifying officials regarding 5109.17.

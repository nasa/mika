ID,Title,Requirement,Rationale
HLS-S-R-0321,Space System Cyber Security,"The HLS shall secure all data and systems including traditional IT, operational technology, and specialized space systems. These cyber measures not only include systems internal to the HLS but also apply to interconnection interfaces with other space assets (Orion, Gateway, etc.)","Per the recent release of Space Policy Directive-5, NASA-STD-1006 Space System Protection Standard, and the cyber requirements levied by the contractual requirements included by the NASA FAR Supplement 1852.204-76. NASA is not alone in the lunar regime, including some adversaries who might be interested in interfering with the operations of NASA assets."
HLS-S-R-0004,Failure Tolerance to Catastrophic Events,"The HLS shall provide at least single failure tolerance for the control of catastrophic
hazards, with the specific level of failure tolerance (one or more) and implementation
(the use of similar or dissimilar redundancy) derived from an analysis of hazards, failure
modes, and risk associated with the system.
Failure tolerance capability is without the use of: aborts; emergency equipment and
systems; or corrective maintenance.
Note: Additional details are provided in HEOMD-003, Crewed Deep Space Systems
Certification Requirements and Standards for NASA Missions section 5.2.2.
Exemption A: Failure of primary structure, structural failure of pressure vessel walls, and
structural failure of pressurized lines are exempted from the failure tolerance
requirement provided the potentially catastrophic failures are controlled through a
defined process in which approved standards and margins are implemented that
account for the absence of failure tolerance.
Exemption B: Other potentially catastrophic hazards that cannot be controlled using
failure tolerance are exempted from the failure tolerance requirements with mandatory
concurrence from the HLS Program Manager, Director JSC (for crew risk acceptance),
and the HLS Program Technical Authorities provided the hazards are controlled through
a defined process in which approved standards and margins are implemented that
account for the absence of failure tolerance. For selected cases where use of a
reliability-informed approach is required, as agreed by the HLS Program Manager, Director JSC, and HLS Program Technical Authorities, the reliability requirements shall
be verified with appropriate confidence intervals using robust reliability approach that is
substantially anchored in actual test data verifying margins to environments (natural and
induced), life requirements, operational boundaries, and failure modes.","The overall objective is to provide the safest design that can accomplish
the mission, given the constraints imposed on the Program. Since a HLS development
will always have mass, volume, schedule, and cost constraints, choosing where and
how to apply failure tolerance requires integrated analyses at the system level to
assess safety and mission risks.
First and foremost, when failure tolerance is practical, the failure tolerance is applied
at the overall system level - to include all capabilities of the system. While failure
tolerance is a term frequently used to describe minimum acceptable redundancy, it
may also be used to describe two similar systems, dissimilar systems, dissimilar down
mode, cross-strapping, or functional interrelationships that ensure minimally
acceptable system performance despite failures, or additional features that completely
mitigate the effects of failures. Even when assessing failure tolerance at the integrated
system level, the increased complexity and the additional utilization of system
resources (e.g. mass, power) required by a failure tolerant design may negatively
impact overall system safety as the level of failure tolerance is increased.
Ultimately, the level and type of redundancy (similar or dissimilar) is an important and
often controversial aspect of system design. Since redundancy does not, by itself,
make a system safe, it is the responsibility of the engineering and safety teams to
determine the design that optimizes safety given the mission requirements and
constraints. In such a design, both the risk from individual contributors (e.g., hazards
or failure modes) and the total risk for the reference mission are below acceptable
levels."
HLS-S-R-0110,Fault Isolation and Control,"The HLS shall provide the capability to isolate and recover from faults identified during
system development or mission operations that would result in a catastrophic event","To meet agency human rating requirements for space vehicles, the HLS
must provide the capability isolate and control identified faults."
HLS-S-R-0027,HLS Reliability,"Each reference missions shall have the following minimum per mission reliability from
Crew Staging Vehicle (CSV) separation to CSV return. ","The HLS must maintain a minimum reliability for each follow on mission,
which may increase mission objectives (such as longer duration) that will require a
robust hardware reliability improvement task. The scope of the requirement includes
the HLS hardware reliability associated with must work and must not work functions
for the life of the program. In addition, HLS allocated hardware reliability supports HLS
compliance with program-level Loss of Crew and Loss of Mission requirements. Also,
software was explicitly excluded because there is not a standard methodology for
performing software reliability. In addition, hardware reliability does not consider
damage due to MMOD environment or human actions associated with its operation.
Defined mission environment includes loads, thermal, radiation etc. HLS hardware
reliability includes HLS hardware required to support performance of the EVAs
required per mission (e.g. Airlock cycles) but does not include the reliability associated
with the EVA suit which is not considered HLS hardware. Hardware reliability does not
consider fire or medical risk."
HLS-S-R-0307,HLS Operation Mass Delivery from Earth,"The HLS shall deliver 1,132 kg of GFP from Earth surface to NRHO for the Orion Direct
Sortie, 867 kg (threshold) and 1,768 kg (goal) of GFP from Earth surface to NRHO for
two-crew sortie missions, and 1,524 kg (threshold) and 2,576 kg (goal) from Earth
surface to NRHO for four-crew extended missions.","This requirement provides robustness to the HLS in the event that Gateway
will not be able to provide supplies to HLS. The masses defined within this requirement
are based on two crew and GFP for sortie missions and four crew and GFP for
Extended missions and establish minimum operational capabilities for surface
operations. Operational uses of the delivered mass will be determined during mission
planning. Masses assume a specific delivery implementation for EVA and launch and
entry suits for the missions. Mass also includes consumables Orion needs during the
lunar surface mission. Other implementations are possible, which may change the
required delivery mass."
HLS-S-R-0308,Utilization Cargo Delivery from Earth,"Utilization Cargo Delivery from Earth [DRM-001, DRM-003, DRM-ODS]
The HLS shall be capable of delivering from Earth surface to NRHO utilization cargo of
150 kg (TBR) and 1.59 m^3 (TBR) volume (threshold) and 1000 kg (TBR) and 7.09 m^3
(TBR) volume (goal), inclusive of tare, in accordance with the parameters that are
notionally specified in","Specified mass does not include operations mass return. Sustaining HLS
missions are expected to deliver utilization equipment and tools to accomplish
objectives. They are also desired to have a freezer in order to return lunar volatiles

requirements for pressurized and unpressurized volumes and mass allocations for
initial proposal and design purposes. The listed hardware is notional, generally
reflecting high level NASA desires. Specific hardware to fill mass/volume allocations
will be determined later by NASA on a mission-specific basis."
HLS-S-R-0309,Utilization Cargo Delivery from Earth,"The HLS shall be capable of delivering from Earth surface to NRHO utilization cargo of
50 kg (TBR) and 1.43 m^3 (TBR) volume (threshold) and 1000 kg (TBR) and 7.09 m^3

requirements for pressurized and unpressurized volumes and mass allocations for
initial proposal and design purposes. The listed hardware is notional, generally
reflecting high level NASA desires. Specific hardware to fill mass/volume allocations
will be determined later by NASA on a mission-specific basis. Reduced down mass
threshold for 4 crew missions assumes that additional tools/utilization hardware are
pre-deployed on other surface assets."
HLS-S-R-0322,Quiescent Lunar Orbit Operations,"The HLS shall be capable of maintaining quiescent operations for no less than 60 days
(threshold) and 90 days (goal) at Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO).","For the specified DRMS, the Crew will not launch until Lunar Orbit Checkout
Review (LOCR). The HLS may need to remain in NRHO for 90 days after the HLS is
confirmed operational, to await crew and cargo delivery, including potential launch
scrubs and mission delays."
HLS-S-R-0304,HLS Automated RPODU,"The HLS shall be capable of automated rendezvous, proximity operations, docking and
undocking with both Gateway and Orion.","The HLS will need Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, Docking and
Undocking (RPODU) capability to transfer crew and cargo to and from HLS.
The HLS must provide compatible docking mechanism to both Gateway and Orion as
well as a full automated RPODU functionality to dock with both. The HLS must have the
contingency capability to dock with Orion on a Gateway mission."
HLS-S-R-0061,Automated Missions,"The HLS shall be capable of conducting an automated landing on the lunar surface and
return to NRHO.","Automated landing and return is required to reduce crew workload during
critical operations."
HLS-S-R-0109,Remote Operation of the HLS,"The HLS shall provide the capability for the surface crew, orbiting crew, and Mission
Systems, to monitor, operate, and control the HLS elements and subsystems remotely,
when
a) The remote capability is necessary to execute the mission; or
b) The remote capability would prevent a catastrophic event; or
c) The remote capability would prevent an abort.","To meet agency human rating requirements for space vehicles, the HLS
must provide the specific capability."
HLS-S-R-0325,Remote operation of uncrewed spacecraft by the HLS,"The HLS shall provide the capability for the crew to monitor, operate, and control an uncrewed
spacecraft during proximity operations, where:
a) The capability is necessary to execute the mission; or
b) The capability would prevent a catastrophic event; or
c) The capability would prevent an abort.
Note 1: Proximity operations cover several scenarios, but this term is specifically
defined as two (or more) systems operating in space (not on a planetary surface) within
the prescribed safe zone for either system
Note 2: When an uncrewed space system is the active spacecraft performing proximity
operations with a crewed spacecraft, this requirement includes the capability for the
crew to monitor the trajectory of the uncrewed system. At a minimum, the crewed
system will have the capability to send basic trajectory commands to hold/stop,
continue, and breakout to the uncrewed spacecraft. Active means the spacecraft is
changing the flight trajectory and orbital parameters to effect the desired result during
proximity operations.","To meet agency human rating requirements for space vehicles, the HLS
must provide the specific capability"
HLS-S-R-0324,HLS Habitation Capability,"The HLS shall provide a habitable environment for two (2) to four (4) crew for at least
eight (8) (TBR) Earth days.","The HLS must be able to provide habitability for the specified duration,
whether the crew complement is two or four."
HLS-S-R-0073,Window(s) for Crew Tasks,"The HLS shall provide one or more window(s) for crew use through all phases of flight
that provides direct, non-electronic, through-the-hull viewing and the unobstructed fieldof-
view necessary to perform critical crew viewing tasks.","During descent and landing, and while performing RPOD (rendezvous,
proximity operations, and docking) as the chaser vehicle, the crew must check the
performance of automatic systems and ensure landing zone hazard avoidance. A
suite of electronic sensors, cameras and window(s) support automatic and blended
automatic/manual control capabilities. Windows increase crew safety and mission
success probability by enabling critical crew viewing functions:
1. Provide situational & spatial awareness for the crew to monitor the automated
system and make Go/No-Go decisions until touchdown for landing, or until docking
contact for RPOD
2. Provide cues to confirm the Landing Zone location, and that it is clear of hazards
prior to touchdown
3. Provide cues for the crew to validate acceptable descent, lateral and longitudinal
drift rates throughout terminal descent until touchdown for landing or until docking
contact for RPOD
4. Provide cues to confirm HLS is within the docking cone, is in proper attitude, and
that the two vehicles remain in alignment until docking interface contact and capture
5. Provide insight enabling crew re-designation of an alternate landing target
6. Support manual/blended control if primary automated system degrades or fails"
HLS-S-R-0318,HLS Operation Mass Delivery from NRHO,"The HLS shall deliver 770 kg (threshold) and 820 kg (goal) of crew and GFP from
NRHO to the lunar surface for two-crew sortie missions and shall deliver 1,550 kg
(threshold) and 1,700 kg (goal) from NRHO to the lunar surface for four-crew extended
missions.","The masses defined within this requirement are based on two crew and GFP

implementations are possible, which may change the required delivery mass."
HLS-S-R-0356,Utilization Cargo Delivery from NRHO,"The HLS shall be capable of delivering from NRHO to the lunar surface utilization cargo
of 150 kg (TBR) and 1.59 m^3 (TBR) volume (threshold) and 1000 kg (TBR) and 7.09
m^3 (TBR) volume (goal), inclusive of tare, in accordance with the parameters that are
notionally specified in","Specified mass does not include operations mass return. Sustaining HLS
missions are expected to deliver utilization equipment and tools to accomplish
objectives. They are also desired to have a freezer in order to return lunar volatiles
and biological/human health samples. The intent of this table is to provide
requirements for pressurized and unpressurized volumes and mass allocations for
initial proposal and design purposes. The listed hardware is notional, generally
reflecting high level NASA desires. Specific hardware to fill mass/volume allocations
will be determined later by NASA on a mission-specific basis."
HLS-S-R-0326,Utilization Cargo Delivery from NRHO,"The HLS shall be capable of delivering from NRHO to the lunar surface utilization cargo
of 50 kg (TBR) and 1.43 m^3 (TBR) volume (threshold) and 1000 kg (TBR) and 7.09
m^3 (TBR) volume (goal), inclusive of tare, in accordance with the parameters that are
notionally specified in","Specified mass does not include operations mass return. Sustaining HLS

reflecting high level NASA desires. Specific hardware to fill mass/volume allocations
will be determined later by NASA on a mission-specific basis. Reduced down mass
threshold for 4 crew missions assumes that additional tools/utilization hardware are
pre-deployed on other surface assets."
HLS-S-R-0108,Manual Control,"The HLS shall provide the capability for the crew to manually control the flight path and
attitude.","The capability for the crew to control the spacecraft's flight path is a
fundamental element of crew survival and mission success. A minimum
implementation of manual control for lunar landing allows the crew to bypass the automated guidance of the vehicle to affect flight path. In addition, a minimum
implementation for RPODU allows for manual attitude control. Selection of an
alternate landing site/target is an expected capability of an automated landing system,
however, limiting the crew to choices presented by the automated guidance function is
not a valid implementation of manual control.
The intent of this requirement is to provide the crew the ability to take control of the
spacecraft during all crewed phases of flight, especially during critical phases, if there
are issues with the automated system (failures or unexpected performance) to (1)
protect crew survivability and (2) enable mission success. Applied to a lunar lander,
the most critical phase is the actual terminal descent and landing on the lunar surface
that is populated with landing zone hazards. An automated flight control system will be
a closed loop system continuously working toward a precision landing at the
designated landing site while performing landing zone hazard detection, analysis, and
avoidance during the terminal landing phase. One possible implementation of this
requirement for a lunar lander would be that the crew can exit the closed loop
automated software and algorithms that are making the decisions on both precision
landing and hazard avoidance while then making the key inputs to manually control/fly
the spacecraft to avoid hazards and achieve a safe and successful landing. A specific
example for this terminal landing phase would be the crew controlling descent, lateral
and longitudinal drift rates with automation likely handling other facets of the vehicle
control such as vehicle attitude. These would be considered “blended” manual control
solutions and other blended solutions may exist. Other critical phases of flight include
undock/back-away to start the lunar surface mission and the approach/rendezvous
return to complete the lunar surface mission. Reference CA-19-0023 Human Landing
Systems White Paper for Manual Control Systems.
Note: Manual control cannot be safely or accurately performed without the spatial and
situational awareness tools to provide status, feedback, and flight control direction.
Safe operation requires both accuracy of crew inputs and Level 1 handling qualities to
meet human rating requirements. Tools include, but are not limited to, telemetry,
displays, video, instrumentation, and windows. Manual control implementation and the
supporting tools will be verified in a cockpit environment to ensure they are adequate
to support manual control and operations appropriate for the lunar lander."
HLS-S-R-0306,Surface Access,The HLS shall provide the following spatial access to the lunar surface:,"HLS will be capable of crewed sorties to high-value locations in addition to
the lunar South Pole. Sorties will require polar (DRM-001 and DRM-ODS) and
nonpolar (DRM-003) access, while extended surface stay missions (DRM-002 and
DRM-004) will always be to the South Pole. Specific mission profiles will be defined
on a site-by-site basis to determine appropriate surface durations while maintaining
manageable energy requirements and while considering mission support roles from
other available government lunar assets. The HLS will be capable of operating in a
range of thermal and solar environments as dictated by the latitude and longitude of
the sites selected however considerations will be made for local surface topography"
HLS-S-R-0090,Digital High Resolution Imagery & Audio Capability,"The HLS shall be capable of providing interior and exterior digital high resolution still
and digital high-resolution motion imagery with associated audio and metadata, of
critical mission events and major human-interest events, to the crew and to Mission
Systems, during all mission phases, including periods of daylight and darkness.","The agency has established a strategic objective of capturing and
streaming imagery of major human-interest events, crew activities, critical mission
events for scientific, verification, safety, anomaly resolution, public affairs, STEM and
crew health and medical purposes. Simultaneous bi-directional audio and video
streams are needed to support all required operations and flight phases for the HLS,
while also being able to concurrently conduct nominal and off-nominal operations.
Because NASA TV will be native UHD/4K by 2024, the term ‘High-Resolution’, in this
context, means: video streams of at least Full High Definition (1080p30) but preferably
UHD (2160p60). Still Imagery should be composed of at least 20 Megapixels with the
goal of matching (or exceeding) the imagery provided by the Apollo missions. Video
imagery should support human interest events such as nominal and off nominal crew
operations, including medical conferences, private family conferences, engineering
discussions, and STEM outreach, lunar surface EVA operations. GFP camera
system(s) (including xEMU suits helmet cameras) will be provided and can be used to
meet this requirement where feasible.
Mission phases and critical events are defined in HLS-CONOP-006, HLS Program
Concept of Operations, and include the following events: Trans-lunar transit, Lunar
orbit operations, RPODU operations, Lunar descent & landing, Surface Operations,
Lunar Ascent, Return RPODU and post-mission operations. Additional surface
activities that are of value include lander “deck” activities (e.g. dust mitigation),
descent element platform operations, EVA prep activities (suit donning, tool prep,
etc.), Lunar Surface EVAs (first steps, sample collections etc.), post-EVA activities
(lander ingress, suit doffing, regolith decontamination, etc.) Sustaining missions may
have critical mission events that take place in darkness (EVAs, lunar ascent, etc) and
so capability to provide clear and viewable imagery of the event must be accounted
for in the design. Although this functionality is expected to be available during all mission phases, it
does not imply continuous exercise of that functionality. Transmission of the imagery
data is described in the HLS-IRD-004, Human Landing System to Mission Systems
Interface Requirements Document and EVA-EXP-0067, HLS Exploration Extra
Vehicular Activity Interface Requirements Control Document. For example, there may
be times when the communication links cannot support sufficiently-high data rates—
particularly during periods of attitude instability (lunar descent/ascent) where accurate
antenna-pointing is difficult—and this requirement is not meant to imply that multiple
concurrent video streams are required at these times. It is most important to have this
capability during lunar surface EVAs and during RPODU operations (and during other
critical mission events and public interest events), and it would be ‘nice’ to have it
available at other times, when possible. In the event that live video cannot be
provided, the imagery may be recorded for later dissemination. In the event that
internal and external HLS imagery data exceeds transmission capability, as described
in the L2-HLS-MS-0053 (Simultaneous Digital Audio/Video Streams) requirement in
HLS-IRD-004 (Human Landing System to Mission Systems Interface Requirements
Document)(or there is a LOS), the imagery should be recorded for later
downlink/transfer back to Earth."
HLS-S-R-0021,HLS Landing Accuracy,The HLS shall be capable of landing within 100m (3-sigma) of target landing site.,"The HLS is expected to be able to land within an accessible distance of
preselected surface destinations in order to optimize EVA resources, scientific
objectives, fuel consumption, vehicle navigation capabilities, and crew schedule.
The agency has determined that 100 m, or less, is an appropriately accessible
distance that will optimize mission resources. Accuracy better than 100m will be
subject to evaluation."
HLS-S-R-0071,Surface Operations Vertical Orientation,"The HLS shall provide vertical orientation of 0 to 8° (threshold) and 0 to 5° (goal) from
local vertical for surface operations.","The HLS must support all post-landing crew activities. It is expected that
the slope tolerance (landed stability) of the HLS will exceed the acceptable lander tilt
angles for the safe and effective execution of critical crew functions during the lunar
surface mission. As a result, some means of tilt mitigation may be required. Critical
crew habitation operations impacted by lander attitude include EVA suit don/doff, EVA
suit undock and re-dock to donning stand, IVA mobility, eating, sleeping, hygiene, as
well as operation and maintenance of equipment. Critical EVA operations impacted by
lander attitude include hatch ingress/egress, lander “deck” activities (e.g. dust
mitigation), descent element platform translation between the hatch and the ladder, ladder descent/ascent, transition between the ladder and the lunar surface, transport
of tools/equipment to the lunar surface, access to externally stowed tools/equipment,
transport of lunar samples/sample containers to the ascent element, and assistance to
impaired or recovery of an incapacitated crew member (e.g. rescue from the surface
to the interior of the ascent element)."
HLS-S-R-0042,Surface Duration,"The HLS shall be capable of operating on the lunar surface for a minimum of 6.5 Earth
days, when pre-emplaced surface assets are not available.","The optimal NRHO has a period, apolune and perilune that drives the
architecture to a 6.5 Earth day surface stay capability when no additional surface
assets are available."
HLS-S-R-0051,Surface Transfer,"The HLS shall be capable of transferring crew and cargo between the HLS and another
habitable surface asset.","Some sustained reference missions require the crew to transfer from the
HLS to a habitable surface asset. This transfer may be performed in shirtsleeves or
may require crew to EVA one or more times to re"
HLS-S-R-0043,Extended Surface Duration,"The HLS shall be capable of operating on the lunar surface for a minimum of 32
(TBR) Earth days, including up to 28 (TBR) days in uninhabited standby mode, when
pre-emplaced surface assets are available.","The accessibility of pre-emplaced surface assets allows an extended
mission, during part of which HLS will be uninhabited."
HLS-S-R-0314,Operational Cabin Pressure Range,"The HLS shall be capable of operating with a cabin pressure that ranges from the
vacuum of space to a maximum of 10.8 psia.","The crewed staging vehicles that HLS will dock with in NRHO will nominally
operate at 10.2 psia, which requires the capability to operate at the upper bound of
10.8 psia, the maximum design pressure. HLS will need to provide pressure relief for
unexpected overpressure events (above 10.2 psia) for the integrated stack of crew
staging vehicles and HLS while HLS is docked to the crew staging vehicles. The minimum bound is driven by the need for HLS to continue to successfully operate in a
full depressurization scenario. Additionally, any volumes exposed to the lunar
environment to enable crew egress or ingress for EVA will be exposed to a vacuum
environment during surface operations."
HLS-S-R-0315,Lunar Surface Operational Cabin Pressure,"The HLS shall be capable of operating at a steady state cabin pressure of 8.2 psia (56.5
kPa) +/- (TBD) on the lunar surface.","8.2 psia operating pressure facilitates EVA operations, and balances
timeline impacts of pre-breathe protocols, flammability risk of increased oxygen
partial pressures, and two types of risk to the crew: risk of decompression
sickness and risk of reduced performance due to hypobaric hypoxia."
HLS-S-R-0029,Concurrent RF Communication,"The HLS shall be capable of concurrent RF communications with crew staging vehicle,
Mission Systems, Spacesuits and Surface assets.","Some HLS operations may require the capability to communicate with EVA
Crew, Mission Systems and the crew staging vehicle at the same time. The ability to
communicate concurrently is expected to be available during all mission phases,
including HLS lunar surface operations, when physics and line-of-sight allows, but
does not imply continuous exercise of that functionality. In context of sustaining
missions, “Space Suits” can be interpreted as meaning not only the xEVA suits
themselves, but also other lunar surface assets, such as Lunar Terrian Vehicle (LTV),
Pressurized Rover, and Foundational Service Hab."
HLS-S-R-0070,Surface Lighting Conditions,"The HLS shall be capable of operating in continuous daylight conditions on the surface
with intermittent periods of 150 hours (threshold) and 192 hours (goal) of continuous
darkness.","In the sustained architecture, the HLS will be required to survive periods of
lunar night, periods of eclipse and periods of occultation in addition to periods of
daylight."
HLS-S-R-0048,EVA Duration,"The HLS shall be capable of supporting EVAs lasting a minimum of 8 hours, plus one
hour allocated for contingency.","For safety purposes, EVAs are always performed in a two crewmembers
buddy system. Final determination on duration of EVAs will be made by the science and
surface operations team. For a nominal mission, the contingency hour of consumables
will be filled on the initial fill and never used. These consumables are stored separate
from the nominal consumables. If a contingency happens during an EVA and the
contingency hour is used and subsequent EVAs are planned and followed through with,
the contingency hour consumables would have to be refilled."
HLS-S-R-0050,EVAs per Reference Mission,The HLS shall be capable of providing the following planned and unplanned EVAs:,"Exploration and Science mission objectives require EVAs for mission
success.
 For [DRM-001 and DRM-ODS], HLS must support four nominal EVAs and one
unplanned EVA for events required to protect crew safety or mission success.
 For [DRM-003], HLS must at minimum be configurable to support from one to four
nominal EVAs and one unplanned EVA.
 For [DRM-002] and [DRM-004], the HLS must support one unplanned EVA for every
two crewmembers.
Additional capability must be allocated if a vendor design requires an EVA for
departure prep/clean-up or ascent performance mitigation."
HLS-S-R-0319,HLS Operations Mass Delivery Return to NRHO,"The HLS shall return 750 kg (threshold) and 800 kg (goal) of crew and GFP from the
lunar surface to NRHO for two-crew sortie missions and shall return 970 kg (threshold)
and 1,620 kg (goal) from Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) to the lunar surface for
four-crew extended missions.","The masses defined within this requirement are based on two crew and GFP
for Sortie missions and four crew and GFP for Extended missions and establish
minimum operational capabilities for surface operations. Masses assume a specific
return implementation for EVA and launch and entry suits for the missions. Other
implementations are possible, which may change the required delivery mass."
HLS-S-R-0056,Utilization Cargo Return to NRHO,"The HLS shall be capable of returning from lunar surface to NRHO utilization cargo of
100 kg (TBR) and 0.17 m^3 volume (TBR) (Threshold), and 300 kg (TBR) and .47 m^s
volume (TBR) (Goal) inclusive of tare, in accordance with the parameters that are
notionally specified in Table 4-3: Utilization Cargo Return to NRHO.","Specified mass does not include operations mass return. Sustaining HLS
missions are desired to have a freezer in order to return lunar volatiles and
biological/human health samples. The intent of this table is to provide requirements for
pressurized and unpressurized volumes and mass allocations for initial proposal and
design purposes. The listed hardware is notional, generally reflecting high level NASA
desires. Specific hardware to fill mass/volume allocations will be determined later by
NASA on a mission-specific basis."
HLS-S-R-0058,Abort to Crewed Staging Vehicle (CSV),"The HLS shall be capable of conducting a safe return and dock to the crewed staging
vehicle within NRHO in the event of an abort.","The agency requires crewed vehicles to have the capability to abort to a
safer location. For the case of a lunar surface mission, the requirement is for the
crewed vehicle to be able to return to NRHO for rendezvous and dock. Astrodynamic
considerations may dictate that the HLS provide a “shelter in place” capability until
the next available launch window presents itself."
HLS-S-R-0055,HLS Lunar Orbit Insertion,"The HLS shall be capable of completing lunar orbit insertion autonomously and without
crew assistance.",The HLS will need to insert into various lunar orbits throughout the mission.

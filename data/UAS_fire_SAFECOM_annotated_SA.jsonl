Aircraft launched to perform a backhaul mission, while the UAS was operating, planning to fly with adequate separation. Once in the air Aircraft attempted to contact the UAS operator with no effect. Aircraft returned to base after no contact with the UAS operation. Aircraft took appropriate action, providing for safety first. The UAS mission was organized by the local agency representative to the fire. The fire incident team did not know about the mission until it was about to launch when the UAS pilot asked OPS for permission to fly. OPS said okay knowing that no one was flying at the time. Meanwhile the AOBD had cleared a backhaul mission to start and was about to inform OPS when he learned about the UAS unplanned mission. The AOBD tried to contact the UAS operation but was unable to do so. He then learned that Aircraft had returned to base and within a few minutes that the UAS mission had completed. Identified problems 1. UAS mission planning did not go through normal incident planning which would have captured intent, execution, coordination, and approval of the IC et. al.. 2. While an attempt was made to do the UAS mission right, such as obtaining frequencies and talking with the helicopter pilot and manager to guarantee proper separation, steps were missed such as gaining approval from the IC and access to the TFR through the AOBD or ATGS. 3. OPS gave approval to fly on the fire inside the TFR without the authority to do so. 4. The UAS operator did not respond to radio calls while flying, on command or air to ground, even though the radios had been used prior to flight to talk to OPS. It is unknown why this was the case. The UAS pilot depended on the agency rep to monitor the radio. 5. To obtain the UAS, agency rep had gained permission from the other incidents OPS to borrow the aircraft and operator. The UAS operator sent a text to the other incident aviation staff, which was not received because the cell tower was not working. This meant that the lend/lease process where the other incident  AOBD would have informed incident AOBD did not occur. 6. The agency rep assumed that if he talked with OPS of each fire to borrow and use the UAS that the OPS would contact and gain necessary approvals and then told the UAS operator that it was okay to fly.   A meeting with the two fire aviation staffs, the UAS operator, the agency rep, the forest aviation officer was held to discuss what went wrong and how to make things better.

This will provide proper briefings, TFR permissions, etc just as if it were a helicopter.3.\tSpontaneous missions should be considered a “watch out” and generate a pause to reflect on the mission as well as the procedures so that steps are not missed to expedite the mission.4.\tUsing text messaging does not guarantee communication.  Verifying requests, information receipt, etc may mean follow up conversations.  One should not assume that the absence of response is approval.5.\tOPS must remember that UAS are aircraft and must follow aircraft rules.6.\tCaution should be applied when a non-assigned to a fire person requests a mission within a fire operation or a TFR.", "label": [[41, 76, "MOD"], [12, 26, "EFF"], [1649, 1673, "CAU"], [2587, 2610, "CON"], [2688, 2718, "REC"], [2723, 2772, "REC"], [2886, 2924, "REC"], [3398, 3421, "REC"], [373, 398, "EFF"], [405, 438, "MOD"], [598, 632, "CAU"], [918, 952, "CON"], [999, 1028, "EFF"], [1125, 1152, "CAU"], [1439, 1456, "CAU"], [1549, 1618, "CAU"], [2115, 2141, "CAU"], [1335, 1356, "CON"], [1361, 1394, "CON"], [2818, 2876, "CON"], [2945, 2980, "REC"]], "Tracking #": "17-0971", "Mission Type": "Fire, External Load (Longline)"}

{"id": 14362, "data": "Air Attack 1 was working the Prairie Fire about 6 miles NE of Little Falls with FB-201, FB-202, and Helicopter 56BH. Each Fire Boss had made two drops with 56BH continuing to do bucket work. The Pilot of AA1 noticed what he thought was a bird fly underneath the Air Attack platform and above the helicopter that was doing bucket work as AA1 observed from a higher altitude. As the pilot continued to watch the object’s flight he observed that its flight pattern was not consistent with a bird, but that it was instead an UAS quadcopter. AA1 informed 56BH that a UAS had been seen over the fire and 56BH discontinued bucket work and landed at an LZ south of the fire. AA1 repositioned east of the fire and contacted the IC and informed him of the UAS protocol and asked the IC’s assistance in locating the UAS’ operator. The IC made contact with law enforcement and had members of the local fire department that was already on scene to disperse and try to locate the operator. The earlier tanker drops and helicopter bucket work had taken care of most of the running fire. Air Attack 1 contacted HMGB Westerman for an assessment of the fire and his opinion if the ground resources could handle the remaining suppression work. Westerman informed AA1 that in his opinion it could be held with the resources on scene. AA1 contacted IC Butler and relayed the assessment and the IC released AA1. 56BH remained on the ground for approximately 25 minutes after AA1 departed the fire to return to Brainerd TB. The HMGB contacted Brainerd TB and asked that they call the Air Desk to determine the next steps as attempts to locate the drone operator were unsuccessful, and the UAS had not been seen since the initial sighting. Air Desk confirmation was received that if the UAS had not been seen recently, and the operator could not be located, that the flight crew could use their discretion to lift off. The HMGB contacted the IC and confirmed that 56BH was no longer needed on the fire, and that no ground resources, the FD, or law enforcement had seen the UAS airborne. The HMGB let the IC know that 56BH would depart the fire to the south, clear the area as soon as possible, and would not recon. the fire before leaving. Great job on the part of AA1’s pilot maintaining situational awareness and spotting the UAS!  Another reminder that we need to remain vigilant and document all incursions so we can continue our public education and outreach efforts in the hopes of mitigating this issue.

A video on social media showed the SEATs and helicopter in action, making suppression drops on the fire. Some of the footage was taken by a UAS operating in the vicinity. Neither the Incident Commander, the deputy, or aerial firefighters were aware of the UAS. The county Emergency Planner, aware of the safety risk, thought his emergency response units were aware of the danger a UAS poses to piloted aircraft. Thank you for reporting this incursion. All UAS pose a great risk to flight crews regardless of the UAS```` mission and size. MN DNR is in the very early stages of UAS use and on occasion it may be necessary to utilize another agency````s UAS. Any activity with UAS needs to be approved by the Wildfire Aviation Supervisor or delegate, coordinated with the IC, and notification provided to aircraft on the incident. The best practice for UAS is to wait until the initial attack efforts are completed. Unauthorized operations of UAS which endanger manned aircraft are illegal and punishable by law. A Safety Alert was created and shared with Law Enforcement, Fire Departments, and Emergency Managers in addition to the press release regarding UAS. A similar event occurred in April, 2015 which was the catalyst for similar outreach to the MN State Fire Marshalls Office.

The fuselage, leading edges of the wings, and tail boom all sustained significant damage leading to the aircraft being deemed not airworthy.

Shortly after that Visual Observer heard a audible ``smack`` and pilot lost connection to the aircraft. Both Pilot and Visual Observer determined Aircraft had hit something {assumed a tree}.

After refilling the machine and conducting a preflight inspection the pilot and visual observer ran through the preflight checklist and proceeded to take off. Once the aircraft was off the ground and climbing the aircraft automatically began to lift the landing gear into flight position. The landing gear on the left side of the aircraft operated normally, the right side did not and failed to raise. The pilot tried to manually cycle the landing gear but the right side was unresponsive.  Because the Left gear was working properly the pilot was able to lower the gear and safely land the UAS.  Once on the ground the plot and visual observer inspected the aircraft and were able to determine that the two screws that hold the landing gear servo on the right side of the aircraft had become loose, and one was missing. Because of this the drive gear on the servo was not making contact with the landing gear and therefore unable to raise the landing gear. The missing screw was replaced and both were tightened. After the servo was reattached the right landing gear was tested and was functioning properly. OAS personnel were on scene as UAS module crew members and determined that the aircraft was airworthy.

The event occurred while pilot (UASP Aerial Ignition Trainee) and Visual Observer (Qualified UASP Aerial Igniton) were conducting UAS aerial firing operations on the night shift of the Pine Gulch Fire. The UASP flew to the area of the burnout and successfully completed the first leg of the burn pattern dropping  30 balls. The UASP was repositioning to initiate another leg of  firing when the aircraft gave a hatch motion error and puncture motion error. The VO assisted the pilot in resetting the Ignis per protocol. After reset the error became a red error signifying that it was unrecoverable in flight. The visual observer/qualified operator noticed that there appeared to be some form of heat signature visible through the camera that was not expected. He stated he believed there was hang fire in the dropper and took control of the aircraft controller. He then turned the camera to look directly at the Ignis 2 machine and visually confirmed fire in the dropper. He successfully initiated emergency procedure using the radio controller to detach the dropper from the hopper. The IGNIS 2 functioned as designed and the hang fire was separated from the hopper. The UASP remained over the ignition area swinging the jettisoned dropper to visually ensure that fire was extinguished in the dropper for approximately 2 minutes before flying back to landing area. Upon inspection of the aircraft and PSD machine, the melted sphere was still in the dropper. Minimal heat damage was noticed on one of the hopper hatches. No other damage was noticed. The machine was cleaned and bench tested, then flight tested before further use.\r\n\r\nAn AAR was conducted discussing what happened and how it was mitigated with the entire module.

{"id": 14423, "data": "Upon attempting to land after conducting night aerial ignitions the aircraft collided with a tree, tilted and fell about 15' to the ground. The aircraft incurred broken props, broken arm locking tabs, and a broken landing leg. The Ignis housing was cracked around the 3D printed plastic main body. The pilot stated that he had lost perspective of the aircraft position and the pad. He also said that he could not see the tree line as it blended in with the darkness. There was very little natural illumination and we were using truck headlights to light up the pad.  There was discussion about how the truck headlights had possibly obscured the pilots night vision and made it more difficult to pick out the tree line. The previous nights we had used a hand held LED light to spot the aircraft while incoming and to spot the pad while causing less washout. To correct for the loss of perspective for night landing we discussed having the visual observer 90 degrees off of the landing pad and the pilot so he could assist with ensuring obstacle clearance. It was also discussed using the camera to confirm location before descending.  \r\n\r\nRASM:  It is confirmed that in fact this is not a reportable accident due to no damage to property, other than the sUAS, or injury to persons; rule is specific to UAS.  After the incident, the team did exactly what they are supposed to and should do, analysis & self-analysis.  They deserve credit for practicing that notion, to continue to improve and correct, individual and program advancement.  The corrective actions are accurate but some “food for thought” and “thinking out loud” is offered in addition, and they are just that.  Now that we are finding both the need and the authorization to fly at night, a strong suggestion is to expand aviation training for the interagency UAS community to include, what is particular to this case, a robust night flying learning package.  There are so many aspects of night flying and the resulting tactics, techniques and procedures that we can take advantage of for further skill development.  In fact, the agencies ought to own an obligation to provide them with all the tools possible.  A fair amount of night flying incorporates compensation and it sounds like this group is successfully doing that but possibly keenly figuring it out on their own, and they are actually doing a good job of it.  But are we leaving too much up to discovery learning?  This training can try to avoid that and help further develop those skills.   There were some things going on that night that this teaching may have had the crews better prepared for; the darkness of a moonless night, the black of an already burned area, the scorched black (invisible) snag tree, adjusting by using artificial illumination, trying to wash out competing and obstructing artificial light and more.  A pure UAS pilot might not otherwise have a night flying proficiency like a maned aircraft pilot would have established.  Too many subjects to list here completely but the following are mentioned.  Visual Illusions, blind spots (and how to counter them), off center viewing, minimum altitudes, vertical climbs and descents to and from those altitudes when necessary, night vision, protecting night vision, artificial illumination, different types of artificial illumination, natural light and how to use it all of them to your advantage and how to avoid & counter it to your advantage (intentional washing out to mention just one), UAS’s version of a cross between VFR & IFR (a true vertical assent/decent, perhaps return to home and auto land) and human factors particular to night flying.  A lot more can be covered here but certainly for this discussion a resource for skill improvement and growth, individually and for the greater program.  As we broaden in missions, so to do we need to mature in exposure and training.  There is formal education in this area, a discipline within a discipline of sorts; we might capitalize on it and order the tools this community should have.\r\n", "label": [[1077, 1113, "REC"], [68, 97, "MOD"], [162, 174, "EFF"], [176, 199, "EFF"], [207, 225, "EFF"], [237, 256, "EFF"], [328, 368, "CAU"], [400, 430, "CAU"], [477, 509, "CAU"], [528, 564, "CAU"], [602, 618, "CAU"], [632, 664, "CAU"], [753, 793, "CON"], [937, 987, "REC"], [1777, 1801, "REC"], [1890, 1919, "REC"], [2626, 2654, "CAU"], [2712, 2733, "CAU"], [2660, 2691, "CAU"], [2754, 2777, "CAU"], [2812, 2840, "CAU"]], "Tracking #": "20-0949", "Mission Type": "Fire, Aerial Ignition"}

{"id": 14425, "data": "A small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) and a Type 2 helicopter, configured with a 100 ft longline and bucket, came in close proximity of one another during operations on the Woodward fire.   The Unmanned Romeo XXX (URXXX, a Matrice 600), was engaged in aerial ignition near DP 10, and  the helicopter was working in a daisy chain of 3 helicopters supporting firefighters on the ground with bucket drops. Both aircraft were operating in Division T on the Woodward Fire near the Bear Valley Visitor’s Center (refer to map below).  Aerial supervision was in place and both aircraft were made aware of the presence of the other.   Helicopters were given a specific route to/from the dip and the sUAS was also provided a specific area to operate in.  \r\n\r\nAt approximately 1815 the pilot of the incident helicopter approached the vicinity of DP10, on his way to drop water on the fire.  The aircraft was on the designated route and was climbing from the dip to 1500 ft. MSL over the marine layer to the clear air, when he encountered visual contact with URXXX approximately 100 feet below.  URXXX was in a stationary hover over the marine layer at the time of the encounter. \r\n\r\nThe 1000 ft AGL clearance over the highest terrain feature had positioned URXXX at approximately 1400 MSL, near the altitude where helicopters were operating.  The pilot of the helicopter altered course slightly to the right and passed by the UAV.  The helicopter pilot estimated the UAV to be at about the same altitude as the bucket, and about 100 ft horizontally to the left.  The helicopter continued on the designated route and descended to complete the drop.  Both the sUAS pilot and the helicopter pilot notified Air Attack, who halted the sUAS operation. \r\nConnection to the URXXX was momentarily lost during aerial ignition operations.  The sUAV was at 38% battery life, and reconnection to the aircraft was unsuccessful after several attempts by the operator. The sUAV pilot selected the “Go Home” button to initiate the lost link procedure. The aircraft was observed, by the helicopter pilot, hovering (stationary) at around 1400 ft. during the time of the signal interruption.   URXXX’s visual observer and pilot continued to look for the sUAV with no immediate success. URXXX was finally heard overhead of the original takeoff and landing area at DP10.  The pilot then depressed the “Go Home” button again regain control. The sUAV pilot then maneuvered URXXX to the south of DP10 to clear the smoke and marine layer and to regain a visual of the aircraft. URXXX was located to the south of DP10 and the pilot began descending the aircraft by pitching forward to the landing area south of DP10.  The aircraft was landed without further incident. The sUAS pilot, the incident aviation managers, the helicopter pilot and the air attack all reviewed and discussed this situation to determine what could be done to prevent a similar event.  The following are the contributing factors and on-site recommendations: \r\nFactors contributing to this incident:\r\n1.\tUnmanned Romeo operating at altitudes assigned in AGL; other incident Aircraft operating with altitudes assigned at MSL\r\n2.\tPoor visibility due to smoke and persistent marine layer\r\n3.\tClose operating proximity\r\nWhat went well:\r\n1.\tsUAS pilot immediately notified Air Attack, and shut down operation once the aircraft was back at the LZ\r\n2.\tsUAS Pilot followed all emergency procedures for loss of contact with UAV, IAW the manual\r\n3.\tsUAS Pilot notified Incident Aviation Managers (AOBD) in a timely manner \r\n4.\tHelicopter Pilot practiced see and avoid\r\n5.\tAll parties discussed this occurrence and provided input for this report\r\nRecommendations:\r\n1.\tAll incident aircraft should operate at MSL, rather than AGL.  This will ensure all incident aircraft are operating at the same altitude clearances. (Terrain changes when using AGL can cause conflict by overlapping altitudes with other aircraft operating at MSL, see fig 3). \r\n2.\tEnsure safe operating space (horizontal and vertical) is provided between manned and unmanned aircraft.\r\n3.\tUAS pilots should notify Air Attack immediately of lost communications with the UAV to expedite awareness to other aircraft over incident.

After activation of the 3 mile LRZ at 1900 we descended from 11,500 to the ground without incident, and deemed the LRZ cold with Cinnabar helibase and Missoula Aircraft Dispatch.  During the breakdown we noticed at 1953 a low flying commercial aircraft fly what seemed to be within our 0/0961 TFR 1/4 mile to the North of us. I immediately took a screen shot of my already open flightradar24 app. It showed Delta flight 988 at 9,286 msl.  It was a non-event as we were on the ground.  I called the ASGS (t) and sent him a screenshot. He spoke with Spokane approach and let them know.  The following morning, I made a follow-up call to Spokane prior to launch at the same LRZ. The supervisor was unaware. I received a follow-up call a short time later and was told that our TFR indeed was breached by Delta 988 and exited our TFR at 8,600.  I was concerned that this may happen again tonight. This is most likely a daily flight and if it happened again, we may be in the same airspace at the same time, as we are planning a similar mission.  I also asked if I needed to have a daily call into them prior to launch and recovery. I was assured that it was not necessary as it will not happen again. It is important to have the flightradar24 app to identify aircraft type, tail number, speed and altitude if you see or hear an aircraft that may be in your vicinity. Taking a screenshot can save a lot of time for reporting. We reached out to Spokane approach and were assured that it will not be an issue in the future.  We will continue to monitor our airspace, especially during climb and decent.\r\nRASM comments:  I am appreciative of all the quick communications which took place over this intrusion.  Nice job by the manger to think quickly and use his flightradar24 app.  This intrusion was run to ground very well.  The Natl Airspace Coordinator worked with FAA, Salt Lake Center, and Spokane Approach Control while I worked with Delta Airlines.  It seems all the loops were closed on this from the UAS, AOBD, ASCO, Natl ASCO, Dispatch, GACC, and RASM to the FAA, Center, Approach and Airlines.  Even though good communications took place and the root of this cause was Approach Control dropping the ball, we still must always stay vigilant.  Just because we have a TFR it doesn’t mean it cannot be breached.\r\n", "label": [[272, 302, "CAU"], [325, 347, "CAU"], [389, 408, "CON"], [561, 582, "CON"], [667, 692, "CON"], [823, 846, "CAU"], [1265, 1291, "CON"], [1412, 1431, "CON"], [1691, 1711, "CON"], [1739, 1748, "MOD"], [1795, 1821, "CON"], [1828, 1837, "MOD"], [2160, 2190, "CON"], [2222, 2256, "CAU"], [2279, 2292, "REC"], [2311, 2321, "CON"]], "Tracking #": "20-1098", "Mission Type": "Fire, Infrared Imagery"}
{"id": 14427, "data": "The xxx Creek Fire’s complexity is attracting interest from the various entities that have roles and responsibilities serving the public.  It's drawing additional interest from media and from the general public.  With the popularity and portability of UAS, drones are used by county law enforcement and fire districts.  The public launches them to gather footage, and the media routinely collects video for news coverage reporting current conditions.  There are many reasons to use drones.\r\nThe xxx Creek Fire, since the wind event, has been under very poor visibility which has grounded our manned aviation operation, however we have been collecting some intel from a fire controlled UAS.  A TFR has been over the fire steady with the exception of one afternoon where it was cancelled to facilitate an adjacent fire posting their new TFR.\r\nOnly one agency has asked permission to fly in our TFR on private lands to collect information to facilitate their mission.  Another similar agency has produced video footage and has expressed no interest in working with the fire aviation program to communicate or meet FAA rules.  I am finding many do not fully comprehend the complexity of a fire aviation program, airspace coordination and the communication with players such, as ATGS who direct operations and set priorities.  This lack of understanding can place our pilots, and manned and unmanned aircraft at risk.  Results could be catastrophic or shut our air operations down. \r\n As the UAS program continues grows, sanctioned and unsanctioned, UAS coordinators need to be more available to advise, coach valid users through the FAA approvals, and recommend how best to coordinate UAS airspace.  \r\nOn a complex fire, traditional air operation managers still have the load of the traditional aviation program and now this additional burden.  A lack of experience and understanding of UAS authorizations and operations makes it easy to say “no” rather than allowing the system to work and helping the UAS users to understand priorities, and learning how we can work together under tightly regulated access.\r\nRASM: This event is likely a reflection of similar events going on within this region and nationally. Ensuring UAS managers, program managers and regional and national leadership get ahead of these challenges for ICTs is going to be an ongoing process. This information is critical in understanding the challenges to work on. Will have the UAS specialist in the region comment as needed for this safecom. \r\n\r\nRUASS:  It is imperative that we continue to work closely with our state, county and local cooperators and educate them on UAS airspace and authorizations from the incident and the FAA.  In order to integrate UAS into a Fire Traffic Area within a Temporary Flight Restriction with other manned aviation, we must be able to communicate, coordinate and deconflict the airspace with the appropriate levels of authorization.  Without it, the results could lead to aviation mishaps or accidents.   UAS policy must align with our federal agencies and our cooperators, be understood and known to all UAS entities requesting to offer up assistance.  The utilization of an on-demand regional UAS coordinator will help to manage incoming request from our cooperators and disseminate timely information to the AOBD’s in order to coordinate and deconflict airspace.

{"id": 14438, "data": "The Parrot Anafi was flying an autonomous mapping mission, using Pix4D Capture as the GCS.  Aircraft was 3/4 of the way through the first transect when the pilot noticed the GCS indicated that the aircraft had stopped taking photos momentarily, but then resumed taking photos at the end of the transect.  The aircraft completed the first transect (flying south), then turned to the west to move to the next transect, but continued moving to the west and missed the turn back to the north.  Upon seeing the aircraft go off course, the pilot cancelled autonomous flight mode and attempted to regain manual flight control.  GCS indicated that the aircraft was responsive to command inputs and did yaw, but did not respond to pitch commands and it continued to move to the west.  Pilot attempted to initiate \"return to home\" mode using GCS, but aircraft did not respond.  Pilot used remote controller to begin aircraft descent.  Aircraft descended from 400 ft. to 330 ft., before the signal was lost.  Pilot and crew went to the last known location of the aircraft but did not find it, nor could they re-establish signal link to attempt and track it using the GCS.  At the last known location, the aircraft reported 60% battery.  After the fly away and loss of link event, the GCS reported \"0\" GPS satellites.  It is unknown if GPS signal was lost during flight, or if the GPS signal went to zero after the loss of link, as the pilot did not look at the GPS signal indicator when attempting to recover aircraft while controller still had signal link with the aircraft.  Based on the above information, the pilot assumes that the aircraft did lose GPS signal while in autonomous flight.  It did respond to manual input, for a brief period, but did not respond to \"return to home\" mode, which requires GPS signal.  It also did not return to home after leaving the geofence-limited area.  Winds were moderate (gusting to 15mph at the surface), but within aircraft limitations.  However, the delay from the time the aircraft first went off course to the time the pilot attempted to recover the aircraft may have been sufficient to allow the wind to carry the aircraft out of signal range.    While a definitive cause of the “fly away” event is uncertain, several factors may have contributed to it.  First, the pilot had never experienced GPS signal loss with the Parrot Anafi, nor even heard any other instances, which created a sense of complacency that the GPS “always works” on the Anafi… until it doesn’t.  The chance of it happening should have been anticipated and pro-active steps should have been taken to prepare for it.   The GPS on the Anafi can’t be turned off to practice manual flight, but proficiency flights should simulate GPS failure situations, to keep up the awareness level of the situation with both the pilot and crew.  \r\nSecondly, while there is a pre-flight and post-flight checklist to ensure important steps are not missed, there was not an in-flight emergency checklist to follow to help guide the actions of the crew.  An in-flight emergency checklist, specific for each model of aircraft and each GCS due to variations in operability, should be part of a pilot’s standard checklist.  Having written instructions, easily accessible by the crew, will allow crewmembers to cue the pilot about what sequence of steps should be initiated.  During a stressful incident, i.e. an aircraft fly-away, a procedure checklist to follow will serve a pilot better than their fallible memory, since each aircraft and each GCS perform differently.  \r\nFinally, on-going training (practice flights) would improve muscle memory of what actions to initiate during emergency operations.  In addition to routine proficiency flight, emergency exercises and scenarios should be implemented regularly to maintain preparedness levels.  Since April of this year, the pilot has only flown during emergency responses.  A failure to practice is a practice of failure.", "label": [[540, 572, "CON"], [577, 618, "CON"], [1625, 1653, "MOD"], [925, 943, "EFF"], [980, 995, "MOD"], [2217, 2225, "MOD"], [2331, 2346, "MOD"], [2422, 2442, "CAU"], [2531, 2559, "REC"], [2565, 2603, "REC"], [2724, 2755, "REC"], [2760, 2787, "REC"], [2864, 2901, "CON"], [2961, 2991, "REC"], [3044, 3073, "REC"], [3207, 3234, "REC"], [3395, 3412, "MOD"], [3566, 3583, "REC"], [3585, 3601, "REC"], [3732, 3750, "REC"], [3800, 3829, "REC"], [703, 736, "EFF"], [744, 773, "EFF"], [782, 821, "CON"], [841, 865, "EFF"], [900, 922, "CON"], [1236, 1245, "MOD"], [1249, 1267, "MOD"], [1324, 1344, "CAU"], [1476, 1507, "CON"]], "Tracking #": "21-0138", "Mission Type": "Fire, Other"}

This m600 had maintenance performed by a 3rd party vendor which replaced the motor mounts bought directly from DJI prior to this flight.  This was the 11th flight since maintenance had been completed, however this flight was with a fully loaded Ignis machine to conduct aerial ignition.  On the first UAS PSD mission for this particular m600 since new motor mount replacement, approximately 1 minute into flight, aircraft went into uncontrolled yaw that resulted in loss of control and impacted terrain.

Aircraft impacted the ground damaging landing gear and motors but without significant damage to payloads.  Proper notifications were made.\r\nThe aircraft was located and the motor was dangling from the motor mount via wires. Evidence of motor mount separation was evident. This strongly suggests that the motor broke free of the motor housing during flight.\r\n Mitigations:\r\nReduce the payload weight by reduction of number of balls to 250 and amount of glycol to 3/4 full when able.\r\nAll PPE will be used by ground crews during PSD operations.\r\nNo flights over people.\r\nMinimize aggressive throttle and/or pitch/roll maneuvers.\r\nIf uncontrolled descent is occurring, immediately lower landing gear and go to max climb rate to slow the descent rate.\r\nBe overly vigilant with pre-flight inspections.\r\nInvestigate potential motor mount replacements from third party vendors.\r\n\r\nRASM:  Completely concur with above corrective actions.  The pilot and rest of the team deserve acknowledgement for reacting quickly in the moment but also for developing strong field countermeasures in real time and for the impending future.

{"id": 14442, "data": "A Parrot Anafi Thermal was in use for situational awareness during a prescribed burn.  The pilot had already completed three flights that day, with minimal issues.  During the second flight, the GCS indicated that the signal between controller and aircraft was weak, and “Return to Home” would be initiated soon, but pilot increased altitude and the signal improved, and RTH was not initiated.  Prior to take off for the third flight, both the controller and aircraft GPS signal did not lock (did not turn green).  After waiting 1-2 minutes, and repositioning the aircraft, both GPS remained red.  The aircraft was rebooted, and shortly after that, both GPS turned green.  There were no anomalies during the third flight.  During the fourth flight, no issues were noted prior to take-off or during the first 15 minutes of flight, but at about 15 minutes the controller provided haptic feedback and indicated that the aircraft GPS signal was lost, and the aircraft was auto-landing in place.  The GCS did not provide an option to cancel the auto-landing.  The pilot attempted to break out of the auto-landing by providing various control inputs (climb, pitch forward, yaw, return to home), but the aircraft did not respond and the video feed was lost as it descended below the tree line and out of sight.   The pilot was driven to within 500 feet of the last known location of the aircraft, as noted by the GCS, but the aircraft did not reconnect with the GCS.  The pilot and members of the fire crew performed a search of the area, but the suspected landing area was a pine forest with a thick under story of saw palmetto, and the aircraft was not recovered.  At the time the aircraft descended, the area beneath it was green, but within an hour, the advancing fire burned over much of the area.  \r\nThe GCS app in use for all flights was the Parrot FreeFlight 6 app.  All flights conducted in manual flight mode.  Prior to all flights, the safety settings on the GCS were verified that the aircraft would Return to Home and land In case of signal loss (and not land in place or hover in place).  A geofence of .7 miles was set to keep the aircraft within its specified flight range.  The aircraft was within line of sight of the pilot at all times, maintaining a position above the tree line, and the pilot had eyes on aircraft at the time the GCS indicated the GPS signal loss.  The last known location of the aircraft was approximately 2400 feet from the pilot, and there was no indication that the radio signal was weak (no on-screen warning) prior to the auto-land activating, nor during any telemetry checks during the flight.  The issue during the second flight with a weak signal seems to confirm that the aircraft would return to home if it lost signal, but evidence suggests the aircraft lost both GPS signal and the radio signal to the GCS at the same time.    \r\n Without flight log data from the aircraft, the cause of the auto-land remains unknown.  There is no information in the manual concerning loss of GPS events, and no way to simulate it occurring mid-flight.  Ideally, further testing of RTH due to loss of link, in a controlled environment, should be conducted to see if the issue can be replicated. \r\n\r\nPilot performed as qualified and operated the sUAS appropriately.

Approximately 3.5 hours later, at 15:38, Helicopter XXX called Dispatch to announce that they would be flying a reconnaissance mission over the fire. At 15:49, the UAS operator called in to let us know that Unmanned Romeo was on the ground and they would let us know when they lifted again. When Helicopter XXX landed, shortly after 16:00, Dispatch received a call from the IC that the UAS crew had some concerns that Dispatch did not alert them that the Helicopter was about to fly over the Fire. After consulting NWCG document PMS 515 (NWCG Standards for Fire Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations), it appeared that mission flights should be coordinated \"with participating aircraft when aerial supervision is not on scene.\" (p. 4) Further consultation with the Forest FAO led to a discussion about the role of Dispatch during an operational flight on an extended attack fire. It was decided that Dispatch should call all the aircraft and confirm that they are aware of UAS operations in the area or call to confirm that the UAS is on the ground. In the end, this was a learning experience about UAS protocols. We (dispatch) familiarized ourselves with PMS 515 and had some good discussions about potential scenarios.  Ultimately, clear communication was identified as the key to successful operations. Arrival of a UAS on a fire is a trigger point that protocols for airspace coordination will need to be established. It is still not completely clear if there is a standard is for this situation or if protocols will be developed on a case-by-case basis. Another miscommunication: the logs for 6/11 indicated that the UAS and Helicopter would NOT be in the air at the same time. (It's not believed that they were ever in the air together) It was also realized that we didn't really have a clear plan for monitoring the UAS flight (no AFF or timers). Another discussion that arose is whether a qualified aircraft dispatcher is required to track UAS activity, especially during night operations, when staff may be limited. In sum, this was a valuable learning experience that brought up many new questions related to UAS operations and opened our eyes to potential issues.

{"id": 14453, "data": "I was flying the IR mission for the afternoon, when the mishap occurred.  I had taken off and landed two times previously while completing the requested IR missions for the fire we were on.  Upon landing for the third time, I brought the M600 down onto the landing platform.  After the M600 was solidly on the platform, I brought the left stick down and in to disarm the motors.  As I did that, I also brought the right stick down and in.  This caused the UAS to tip backwards off of the platform and into the grass and shrubs.  One of the six propellers broke when this happened.  Additionally, two of the red tabs that lock the arms into the frame of the UAS body broke off.  We replaced the propellers and red tabs and closely inspected the rest of the UAS for any other damage.  Finding none, we called the AFS UAS Specialist and reported what had just happened.  After conferring with the UAS Specialist, all agreed that we should connect the controller to the UAS and make sure that everything seemed to be working correctly.  We did that, and went through the start up sequence to the point of arming the motors.  Everything appeared to functioning normally.  We disarmed the motors and shut the UAS down.   There are two parts to this Safecom.  The first is the actual event where the UAS tipped over, and the second is a discussion on the BLM guidance for UAS training on new platforms.  My intent with submitting this Safecom is that we may learn from both parts.\r\n\r\nThe tip over:\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to my computer the following day, I reviewed the M600 manual to see what I had done wrong, since I didn’t feel like I had changed anything in my landing and disarming procedure from the first two flights, to the third, where the tip over occurred.  \r\nWhile pulling both controller sticks down and in is an approved method for disarming the M600 as stated in the M600 manual, it is a much riskier procedure, as was evidenced by the tip over.  If the motors are not at full idle prior to bring the right stick down and in, there is still enough power in the propellers to provide pitch and roll to the aircraft.  So while I felt like I did the same maneuver for disarming each time, I must have been a little quicker with the right controller stick input on the third landing, than on the first two landings.  This has a very simple remedy.\r\nThe M600 manual also recommends that the UAS be disarmed by using the left control stick only in the down position.  The motors take 3 seconds to power down using this method, but there is no chance for any additional pitch or roll inputs when using the left stick down method.  So, this was a good learning moment for me, and hopefully, others can learn from it as well without having to an M600 over.  \r\n\r\nAdd-on training guidance:\r\n\r\nAfter the events of the day, and after numerous phone calls were made to discuss what had happened, it became clear to me that there was a lack of clarity regarding the UAS guidance for this particular situation that we were in.  One of the questions that came up was whether or not the fully qualified UAS pilot I was flying with on the fire was able to train me on the M600 platform.  Below is an excerpt from the OAS Sharepoint site that provides guidance for training UAS pilots on new platforms. (Since OPM-11 doesn’t directly address Add-on training, and I don’t think there is any specific BLM guidance, I believe the OAS Sharepoint site is the most current language for how the Bureaus intend to operate).\r\n“Bureau Instructors will be able to provide A-454 Aircraft Add-on training to carded DOI remote pilots that need a specific “make and model” added to their OAS-30U card. Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List with an endorsement for A-454 Add-On Training and for the aircraft being evaluated may train and recommend additional aircraft qualifications.”\r\nAfter reading the above statement, I believed that Bureau Instructors were one group of people, and that Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List were another group of people, and it made sense to me.  It seemed very analogous to the manned aviation process for add-on training.  Last summer I did some add-on training for my private pilot’s license when I took a 3 day course to get my float rating.  I was trained each day by a CFI (certified flight instructor), and she taught me how to fly on floats.  She could not however, sign me off as being certified for my float rating.  The DPE (designated pilot examiner) had to do that.  So, when I read the above referenced OAS language, I saw the parallel within that language to how manned aviation worked.  Bureau instructors (CFI’s on the manned aviation side) could train pilots how to fly a new aircraft, and Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List were the ones who could certify that those pilots learning to fly a new aircraft were indeed good to go (the role of the DPE on the manned aviation side).  This also fit nicely with how the Position Task Book system is set up.  Individuals who are Qualified in a position are the ones who train trainees for that position.  \r\nAfter many conversations with a number of folks, I came to understand that this wasn’t the interpretation of the guidance that the Bureau was operating under.  Some folks at the national program level were unclear about how the guidance should be interpreted, but it seemed the majority believed that “Bureau instructors” and “Remote pilots on the Master Instructor List” were the same group of people, not two separate groups.\r\nWhat this shows me is that we have an opportunity to clarify the guidance.  Anytime there is enough uncertainty in policy language or bureau guidance, there lies an opportunity to help fix it for everyone in the future.  The intent may be clear to those who are immersed in the program, but if I was able to misinterpret it, others will likely do so as well.  \r\n\r\n", "label": [[544, 560, "EFF"], [462, 496, "MOD"], [322, 349, "CAU"], [360, 377, "CAU"], [401, 430, "CAU"], [665, 675, "EFF"], [611, 649, "EFF"], [681, 704, "CON"], [709, 717, "CON"], [722, 739, "CON"], [800, 829, "CON"], [834, 865, "CON"], [936, 969, "CON"], [1050, 1084, "CON"], [1293, 1308, "MOD"]], "Tracking #": "21-0566", "Mission Type": "Fire, Infrared Imagery"}

Ops and AOBD were notified and the Branch supervising the geographic area made a radio announcement to resources that no UAS missions were authorized. The notification process was followed appropriately. There was a rumor on the incident that it was possible that the UAS was being operated, unauthorized, by an incident resource. (There were authorized USFS UAS flight approved for night ops on the fire). To mitigate future possibilities of unauthorized use a \"no UAS operations are to occur without AOBD approval\" reminder will be included in the daily incident briefing. During this incident all aircraft had good separation from the UAS while it was being monitored.  To further mitigate the source, the air attack dedicated a short available period of time to attempting to locate the UAS operator. They orbited over the area of Rock Creek (at a safe altitude) with the intention to indicate to the remote pilot that they were aware of their activity, while also attempting to identify them.

After launch, pilot verified controls and proceeded to fly IR/mapping mission. Pilot rechecked control inputs and battery at 1 mile our from GCS. No issues. PIC proceeded to fly to 2-mile mark. At 35% Battery, pilot started return. Single input with stick at full deflection for return flight.  Aircraft responded with uncontrolled yaw. PIC mentioned the issue to Aircraft’s primary pilot. Primary pilot took control and attempted to bring aircraft back, but controlled yaw persisted, and was forced to choose secondary landing site due to limited battery.  Aircraft lost connection to controller at 150 ft while descending to secondary landing site.  Recovered aircraft at secondary landing site. Aircraft sustained damage to all 6 pairs of props.  Discussion with pilot on utilizing equipment that had not been previously flown and understanding each aircraft is slightly different. Ensuring sufficient battery life is maintained for the intangibles. Review of BVLOS operations with all members of module.  If another aircraft is available, choose one that functions without issues for the mission.

{"id": 14464, "data": "South Yaak Fire.  July 29th 2021\r\nUAS was on Div U to assist with aerial ignitions and gridding/patrolling for spot fires during a burnout operation.  Prior to this incident, UAS had conducted 22 flights from this location.  \r\nThe crews started burning at approximately 10:30. The burnout was progressing from the DP132 area to the Div U/T break.  Div U had requested UAS to provide IR flights to assist the holding resources with identifying spot fires.  The UAS was being flown from a large meadow approximately 2000ft from the fire line. UAS was given clearance to operate 5,500ft and below on altimeter 30.12 from DP 132 to the Div U/T break.  AA also informed UAS that there was a Type 2 helicopter working to the south in Div T and a Type 1 working in Div W.  UAS was requesting clearance before each flight.  This flight occurred at 16:27.   \r\nApproximately 12 minutes into the flight I heard a helicopter coming in from the north.  I told the UASP(t) to descend to the treetops and return to the launch area.  From my location the helicopter seemed to be moving along the fire edge to the east of DP-162 and not in the direction of the UAS.  Once the UAS was over the meadow and below the treetops (approximately 2 min), I contacted AA on air to ground primary.  I let AA know that we are still conducting UAS operations and the helicopter seemed close to our area of operations and asked if we needed to set down to allow the helicopter to work.   AA reply was that the helicopter “wandered a bit too far” and to standby.  The UASP(t) landed the UAS (approximately another 2 min), I then let AA know we were on the ground and we were told to stay on the ground.   The UAS remained on the ground the remainder of the shift.  \r\nThe image below is of the track log of the UAS during the flight overlaid on the ops map of the fire.  The green icon is where the UAS was launched from.    \r\n\r\n National UAS Operations Specialist:\r\n1. The UASL attended a meeting at the helibase the following day.  Although at the conclusion of the meeting everyone was able to say what they needed and end on a positive note, there were some comments that may need to be discussed further.  \r\n2. Both helicopters were unaware that a UAS was in the air during their missions.  \r\n3.  The UAS was repeatedly called a toy and it was stated that the UAS pilots “don’t have any skin in the game” and that if we crash a drone we just get another one where as if we crash into a helicopter they would be taking a “dirt nap”.   Although I completely agree with the pilots frustrations and concerns with UAS better communication preseason with the helicopter community as a whole might help with integration.  Use cases and examples of how UAS is utilized usually helps to understand why the demand for UAS is growing so rapidly.  \r\n4. The UASL was asked why we didn't call the helicopter on the victor freq.  The use of hand held VHF radios from the ground has proven to be unreliable for communication.  \r\n5. PMS-515 states For Type 3 and Type 4 UAS Communications are maintained with the UAS crew only on assigned FM frequencies.                           Region 1 UAS Aviation Specialist: \r\n1.\tThe UAS crew followed all their and the Aerial Supervision procedures. But as is not uncommon, things slip through the cracks. When the UAS crew had concerns about the proximity of the helicopter they made a smart and safe decision to descend out of the way and establish communication to check everyone’s situational awareness. This is good decision making on their part. \r\n2.\tCommunication on the air-to-air frequencies is a problem that needs to be solved. A UAS is an aircraft and therefore should have reliable communication on those frequencies. I don’t know how to solve it except to go to radio experts with our issues. A vehicle radio seems impractical, so the solution seems to lie in some sort of booster or antenna. \r\n3.\tSituational awareness enhancement could also be achieved by petitioning the FAA to allow ADS-B output on our UAS. This is again an issue that is probably not easy to accomplish, but worth pursuing. \r\n4.\tManned aircraft pilots having the opinion that UAS has no “skin in the game” in regards to a collision is not unreasonable. To alleviate this, I think the suggestions already discussed would help. To reiterate: More reliable communication and situational awareness may make the manned aircraft pilots and crews feel better about sharing the airspace with UAS. If the manned aircraft pilots believe that they will be able to talk to and see where the UAS is when they need to, their concerns should be diminished. Also, continuing the communication procedures by the UAS pilots as was done in this instance should also be a mitigation for a mishap. \r\n", "label": [[962, 985, "EFF"], [990, 1015, "EFF"], [1231, 1243, "CON"], [1337, 1372, "CAU"], [1479, 1514, "CAU"], [1522, 1529, "EFF"], [1544, 1558, "EFF"], [1651, 1669, "EFF"], [1597, 1608, "CON"], [1677, 1703, "EFF"], [2188, 2212, "CAU"], [2584, 2615, "REC"], [3214, 3244, "CON"], [3410, 3432, "EFF"], [3343, 3370, "CAU"], [3437, 3460, "CON"], [3908, 3941, "REC"], [4322, 4349, "REC"], [4354, 4375, "REC"], [4645, 4669, "CON"]], "Tracking #": "21-0774", "Mission Type": "Fire, Infrared Imagery"}
{"id": 14465, "data": "On the evening of August 10th, 2021, while flying night operation missions with a CWN UAS, a vendor provided and operated FireEye, on the Monument Fire, the unmanned aerial vehicle experienced a hard landing. This was the initial start of the tour with the plan for a single 2 hour flight for the first night after site selection and setup during daylight hours.  Operation were being conducted between Division U and Division W at 2,700’ MSL with a density altitude at the time of 6,332’.  Take off occurred after a crew briefing, notification to dispatch, helibase, and ASGS verifying all manned aviation flights in the TFR were completed for the day along with the SOP blind radio calls.  After a successful approximate 2 hour flight while returning to the home location, the aircraft transitioned to vertical landing and began descent. The transition overshot the landing area but recovered to directly above the pad by pilot manual input.  Once over the landing pad the aircraft began descending at an increasing rate of speed until rapidly impacting the pad at approximately 2226 hours. The vertical motors appeared operational during descent and although the aircraft appeared stable could not slow the rate of descent. The aircraft fuselage, gimbal, wings, and feet with multiple rotor strikes from the vertical motors were all damaged by the impact with the ground. No personnel were near the aircraft, no other equipment was damaged, and no injuries occurred. Sequence of Events per the Vendor's Mishap Report:\r\nAfter the aircraft overshot the Launch and Recovery Zone (LRZ), it transitioned from forward flight to hover at 200 ft. AGL, 70 ft. above the planned 130 ft. AGL. The overshoot and higher than expected transition altitude were a result of the tailwind. With a tailwind the aircraft final altitude will be higher. The transition process, as expected, flared the aircraft upward by an additional 50 ft. With the aircraft in AUTO mode, the autopilot moved the aircraft in reverse to position over the LRZ. As the aircraft did this, the telemetry logs (tlogs) show that the aircraft autopilot sought to maintain attitude before rapidly descending to land. Once the rapid rate of descent was noted QHOVER was commanded to manually take control of the aircraft for landing. The decent rate was too great to overcome despite the throttle increase command to prevent a hard landing.\r\n\r\nCorrective Actions per the Vendor's Mishap Report:\r\n1) Update crew resource training materials to address the need to ensure checks lists are being followed and to assess unexpected conditions during flight (e.g., no challenge on the aircraft overshot the landing zone at a much higher altitude than expected or whether prolonger operations in reverse made sense vs. QHOVER). \r\n2) The RPIC and RSO were disqualified from piloting duties subject to successful completion of remediation training on the proper operation of aircraft during landing, including when QHOVER is selected during positioning, as well as the identification of standard and non-standard conditions and operations that are communicated \r\namongst crew members to identify potential issues regarding wind direction, velocity, aircraft altitude, and flight characteristics. Pilots can be reinstated once remediation training is successfully completed. \r\nc) Conduct mishap debrief for all vendor pilots. The debrief which included lessons learned / flight documentation changes was completed on 26 August 21.

The pilot started to fly home when the aircraft lost full video and entered “return to home mode”. The pilot retook control of the aircraft and continued to fly home via the map with no video. At approximately 5000 feet from home the Aircraft once again entered “return to home mode” at this juncture despite following procedures to return the Aircraft to “Fly modes” was unable to retake control of the aircraft. At approximately 3000 feet from home all Telemetry was lost. Pilot disconnected and reconnected the tablet twice as well as restarted the flight app. With no telemetry pilot allowed aircraft to return home until visual contact was established again. With the Aircraft in sight the Pilot again attempted to return the aircraft to “fly mode”. The aircraft was unresponsive to any input from the controller. As the aircraft self landed it was missing the landing pad by approximately 3 ft. This created a situation where the aircraft was going to land partially off the road and the cut bank was a extremely steep drop off for a hundred feet or so. As it touched down it immediately started to rock back to fall off the cut bank, the pilot in anticipation of this happening had moved in closer to the aircraft and was able to place his foot on the aircrafts right skid to prevent it from completely flipping over and dropping off the edge. The aircraft rolled to the left with the skid not being held down by the pilots foot falling off the road.

Mission plan on launch was to monitor UAS aerial ignition groundwork directly adjacent to LZ. This mission objective was met quickly and unremarkably. On scene incident personnel then requested IR recon approx. one mile east (Carter Meadows Summit aka H1, see figure). Slopes around H1 had been experiencing rapid fire growth, and several recon missions had been successfully completed prior to this request. As such, this repeat request was heeded given the proximity of H1, known hazards, and remaining battery reserves.\r\n\r\nThis recon around H1 revealed substantial new growth below and on ridges further east, and an add’l direction was given to scout further eastward to gauge fire extent and holding lines. Pilot in command noted remaining battery life (65.5% average across six) and proceed NE then E, gaining ground rapidly due to strong tailwind. This tailwind was not present in recent prior recon flights around H1.\r\n\r\nApprox 1.5mi east of LZ the video feed became unstable. Pilot briefly halted for recon then began navigating home to the west. Notably, video feed did not stabilize despite closing the distance to the LZ – intermittent/broken feed, and frozen screen required VO to disconnect and reconnect tablet cable to GCS. At this point VO noted speed of ~16mph despite full deflection pitch forward. This is a known indicator of severe headwind. GCS remained connected (“green”) throughout with PIC in control.\r\n\r\nAt approx. 1mi east of LZ the craft crossed a large valley that rises steeply up to H1. This was very near the location of a known spot from earlier in the day. As the aircraft approached the westward valley slopes rising up to H1, feed was lost followed by loss of link to GCS. Remaining battery was 24% (average across six), distance to LZ was ~4900ft. Connection was not reestablished. After 10 minutes monitoring airspace for autonomous return to home, the aircraft was presumed lost and airspace authority notifications were made. Due to loss of link and remaining battery life, the incident was reported as a UAS flyaway.\r\n\r\nFollowing notifications and airspace re-clearance, the UAS module regrouped and resumed filling incident recon requests using backup aircraft until end of shift. *Be aware of mission creep* The mission plan on launch was expanded with two subsequent in-flight requests. Completing these requests brought UAS endurance factors into play that were potentially manageable, but not considered in advance to identify and mitigate risks before they arose. If multiple destinations had been considered before launch, range and battery management would have been scrutinized. Returning to LZ from this flight with standard 35% battery reserves would have been in question.\r\n\r\n*Gauge winds throughout flight* Wind amplifies fire behavior and diminishes aircraft endurance. Winds at LZ were no factor, but were substantial in adjacent area where the majority of flight took place. Variable winds led to bad aircraft position, and drove convective fire behavior along the path home to LZ.\r\n\r\n*Be aware of rapidly changing environmental factors when performing repeat flights with the same mission profile* Repeated flights of the same mission profiles can cause complacency. Complacency is not limited to times of slow activity. An increase in operational tempo is commonly an indicator of changing conditions but may not be recognized as such because of tunnel vision at crucial time. Tactical pause may be warranted and is ultimately the responsibility of the pilot in command.", "label": [[88, 107, "CON"], [1332, 1376, "CON"], [1802, 1815, "CAU"], [1828, 1847, "CAU"], [1925, 1957, "EFF"], [2031, 2057, "EFF"], [2062, 2104, "CON"], [2113, 2125, "CAU"], [2130, 2152, "CAU"], [2185, 2197, "MOD"], [1849, 1874, "CAU"], [2870, 2899, "REC"], [3072, 3086, "CAU"], [3183, 3233, "REC"], [1485, 1500, "CAU"]], "Tracking #": "21-0965", "Mission Type": "Fire, Infrared Imagery"}

The second time I was able to determine that it was notifying it was losing satellites. I was at 8 satellites and told the Visual Observer that I was returning to home.\r\nOnce within the landing area the aircraft was not responding well to the inputs. I noticed more drift than normal and once the aircraft was under 20ft it would move horizontally, and the motors would rev. I preformed a \"go around\" and attempted a second landing. The same thing happened so we decided to auto-land the aircraft.\r\nIt Started to respond as it was supposed to and climbed to 240ft and started to descend. \r\nAbout 100ft up it was yawing and \"searching\" for a landing area. The aircraft made maneuvers that were not desirable and I tried to cancel the return to launch. Instinctively, I tried to correct the aircraft with small stick inputs. Before the cancellation was made the aircraft flew into a nearby tree. Crash was recorded at 11:03.\r\nThe aircraft seemed to be rolling right as the crash occurred and not climbing or descending.\r\nPG&E was working on a nearby powerline about 50ft to the south near the crash site. \r\nGPS jamming was communicated before the flight but that we would be outside of the jamming area. \r\nUpon further review we could have been within the cone of the jamming site.      During this incident, coordination through the National Airspace Coordinator was a successful corrective action.  Current UAS fleet is dependent on a strong GPS signal for position location and flight safety.  In situations where firefighting UAS aircraft are operating on the fringe of a known VIP TFR restriction (e.g., a Presidential TFR), it is recommended that incident and regional leadership work through the National Airspace Coordinator for deconfliction and clarification.  Additionally, it may be advisable to increase the safety distance from the pre-identified area and consider grounding aircraft until cleared by the National Airspace Coordinator and Dispatch Center.

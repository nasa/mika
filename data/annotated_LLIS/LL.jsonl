{"id": 16295, "data": "The torque limiters of the External Tank door actuators were redesigned in the early 1990s because of unacceptable degradation of the disk friction surfaces. The new design was a multidisk ball-ramp setup. When the torque reached a certain value, the ball-ramp design reduced the compression load on the disk stack and allowed the disks to rotate relative to each other (slip). The disks in this particular actuator were made of steel and Vespel. After several years of service with the new torque limiter design, most of the actuators exhibited reduced torque output. Investigation determined that the torque limiter degradation was due to grease contamination of the disk surfaces. Inspection confirmed that excess grease was applied to some of the torque limiter components (bearings) during assembly and eventually migrated to the disk surfaces. However, even after the actuators were refurbished, excess grease was removed, and the grease was cleaned from the disks, the actuators often continued to exhibit torque degradation and show evidence of grease contamination of the disks. Another problem was the amount of effort required to set the torque limiter to slip in the required range when the actuator was being serviced. The value at which the torque limiter slips depends somewhat on the temperature, and the actuator is required to operate with a specified torque output through a large temperature range (over 300 °F). Several rounds of adjustments were needed, each followed by days of testing. In addition, there was degradation of the motor clutch/brake assemblies in these actuators. Each actuator has two AC motors, each of which interfaces with the gear box differential through a clutch/brake assembly. For redundancy, the actuator will operate on only one motor. When a motor is not operating, the clutch/brake assembly is in the brake mode. A friction disk is spring-loaded against a stator, which locks the input to the differential and disconnects it from the motor. This is necessary so that during single-motor operation, the nonoperating motor input is not back-driven through the differential. When the motor starts up, the assembly switches to clutch mode. A solenoid pulls the disk away from the stator, separating the brake surfaces and engaging the clutch surface of the disk to the motor output. The motor then drives the differential input through the clutch. During tests of the actuators on the vehicle, the torque output varied significantly by motor mode. Since there is a single torque limiter, the point at which it slips should be the same regardless of which motor is operating. This indicated that the clutch/brake assembly was slipping prematurely. Disassembly and inspection confirmed that both the clutch and brake surfaces were worn. There was evidence of scoring on the interfacing surfaces and metallic debris in the assembly.", "label": [[546, 567, "MOD"], [603, 629, "MOD"], [641, 661, "CAU"], [710, 723, "CAU"], [888, 900, "CON"], [909, 927, "CON"], [937, 956, "CON"], [1012, 1031, "MOD"], [1053, 1073, "CAU"], [1533, 1570, "MOD"], [2646, 2692, "MOD"], [2762, 2780, "CAU"]], "Lesson ID": 2839}

The following lessons were learned in the definition phase of the SAFS/CSAFS development. Use COTS products and re-use previously developed internal products. Create a prioritized list of desired COTS features. Talk with local experts having experience in similar areas. Conduct frequent peer and design reviews. Obtain demonstration versions of COTS products. Obtain customer references from vendors. Select a product appropriately sized for your application. Choose a product closely aligned with your project's requirements. Select a vendor whose size will permit a working relationship. Use vendor tutorials, documentation, and vendor contacts during COTS evaluation period. Test and prototype COTS products in the lab. The prototyping and test phase of the COTS evaluation allows problems to be identified as the system design to matures. These problems can be mitigated (often with the help and cooperation of the COTS vendor) well before the field-testing phase at which time it may be too costly or impossible to retrofit a solution.

{"id": 16365, "data": "The primary cause of the mishap was failure to follow the procedural instructions in PR number PV-6-140247, in which: (1) facility water technicians added a flow test on the Zone 3 system after valve diaphragm repair, and (2) in not fully closing or in improperly reopening the manual riser isolation valve, water was allowed to flow into Zone 3 of the OPF Bay 2 water deluge system. Contributing causes included the following: The OPF GSE technicians, who are members of the \"Contingency Team,\" had not been adequately trained in the operation of the OPF water deluge system. This led to the OPF GSE \"Contingency Team\" technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system, while thinking they were turning the system off. A thorough pre-task briefing (PTB) was not held for the water deluge system valve repair task, which could have prevented deviation from the repair procedure by the facility water technicians. The labeling on the remote manual arming and firing valve activation station of the OPF water deluge system was misinterpreted. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system when they believed they were turning the system off. The remote manual arming and firing valves are in the \"on\" position when perpendicular to the water lines, which is not the industry norm for hydraulic systems. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians believing they were closing the valves by positioning them perpendicular to the water line when, in fact, they were opening the valves. This human factor problem was not addressed in the System Assurance Analysis for the Water System at the OPF, SAA09FY09-007, Revision B, dated July 1987. The manual arming and firing valves behind the OPF are easily accessed by simply opening the individual valve box doors, which destroys the paper integrity seals. Essentially, there was no physical barrier to the valves. Even though redundancy exists for the Viking valves in the deluge system, these valves are open when no dome pressure is applied. Failures which remove dome pressure could result in the flow of water. There are significant configuration differences between the OPF Bay 1 and 2 water deluge systems. The OPF Bay 1 configuration does not include the manual riser isolation valve. Engineering Order E084-79KO5423, which installs the manual riser isolation valve for both bay configurations, has not yet been accomplished for Bay 1. This should be implemented for Bay 1 after OV-103 rollout for STS-33 and prior to another Orbiter occupying Bay 1. There are only 6 boxes for the manual arming and firing valves in the Bay 1 configuration, with the arming and firing valves for a particular zone in the same box. The Bay 2 configuration has 12 boxes, one for each valve. Signs on the boxes are not uniform between OPF Bays 1 and 2. The NASA Test Director (NTD) evacuated OPF Bay 2 via a public address announcement. He could not use the area warning system because OPF Bay 1 would have also been evacuated, which was not required. As a result of the inadvertent activation of the firex deluge system, Orbiter GSE was damaged (i.e., the Mechanical Control Interface Unit for the Remote Manipulating Arm and the Cargo Verification Unit).

{"id": 16369, "data": "The Board has concluded that there were no anomalies on-board the SOHO spacecraft but that a number of ground errors led to the major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft. The Board finds that the loss of the SOHO spacecraft was a direct result of operational errors, a failure to adequately monitor spacecraft status, and an erroneous decision which disabled part of the on-board autonomous failure detection. Further, following the occurrence of the emergency situation, the Board finds that insufficient time was taken by the operations team to fully assess the spacecraft status prior to initiating recovery operations. The Board discovered that a number of factors contributed to the circumstances that allowed the direct causes to occur. FACTORS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSS The Board has concluded that there were no anomalies on-board the SOHO spacecraft but that a number of ground errors led to the major loss of attitude experienced by the spacecraft. The first two errors were contained in predefined command sequences executed from the Ground System, while the last error was a decision to send a command to the spacecraft in response to unexpected telemetry. The sequence of these errors and their relationship to the triggered-ESRs are graphically depicted in Diagram 1. [D] Diagram 1. Failure Event Tree - Top Level (Click image for a larger view) This series of events was preceded by a routine calibration of the spacecraft's three roll gyros. As stated earlier, the gyros are not required during most of the mission. They are used for thruster-based activities such as momentum management, ISA, and ESR. Since the gyro calibration in the compressed timeline is immediately followed by the execution of momentum management, the previously employed procedure to despin the gyros at the end of the gyro calibration and to re-enable the on-board software gyro control function was not required. Following gyro calibration, Gyro A was specifically deactivated (despun) in order to conserve its life, while Gyros B and C remained fully active. Due to an omission in the modified predefined command sequence actually used, the onboard software function that activates the gyro needed by ESR was not enabled. This omission resulted in the removal of the functionality of the normal safe mode and ultimately caused the catastrophic sequence of events. Following the momentum management maneuver, Gyro B, which is used for fault detection, was erroneously left in its high gain setting, resulting in an indicated roll rate of 20 times greater than actual. The incorrect gain was due to an error in another predefined command sequence; this error resulted in an on-board fault detection output that triggered an ESR. This ESR, the 5th since launch, occurred at 7:16 PM EDT (23:16 UT), June 24, 1998. During ESR-5, the control Gyro A was not active because of the first error referenced above; however, there is no evidence or belief that any anomalous spacecraft behavior had occurred. As per design, the ESR event resulted in a reconfiguration of the gyros. Gyro A replaced Gyro C as the roll gyro used for the ESR thruster-based control mode, while Gyro B remained configured as the fault detection gyro. The error in Gyro B's gain was discovered and corrected, but the Gyro A despun status was not identified. After transitioning to the ISA mode as part of the normal ESR recovery sequence, the attitude control system began integrating the gyro drift rate bias associated with the still despun Gyro A. After 15 minutes, this resulted in roll thruster firings intended to null the apparent (but non-existent) roll attitude error. In less than one minute, the roll rate was sufficiently high to trigger the Gyro B based fault detection once again, resulting in ESR-6 at 10:35 PM EDT (02:35 UT), June 24, 1998. Although the spacecraft remained Sun-pointing within nominal limits and was therefore in a power-positive and thermally-safe attitude, the state of the spacecraft was precarious at this point in time. It had an anomalous roll rate and was depending on a deactivated gyro for roll control in both ESR and ISA modes. The personnel on the ground were not aware of either of these facts at that time. Gyro C was correctly configured to the ACU since the reconfiguration at ESR-5. Gyro B was active and on-line for fault detection, and it was correctly measuring the anomalous roll rate. A rapid decision was made that Gyro B was faulty because its output disagreed with the rate indicated by Gyro A. This decision led to the commanding off of Gyro B. During ESR-6 recovery, Ground Operations commanded the spacecraft to ISA mode. In ISA, the attitude control system resumed firing roll thrusters in an attempt to null the attitude error associated with the electrical rate bias term of the despun Gyro A. Gyro B and the associated fault detection were now inactive. The increasing roll rate eventually resulted in pitch and yaw Sun-pointing errors that exceeded a prescribed limit of five degrees, resulting in ESR-7 at 12:38 AM EDT (04:38 UT), June 25, 1998. Due to the gyroscopic cross-coupling torques caused by pitch and yaw thruster firings, and the absence of true roll rate indications, the ESR controller was no longer stable, and the spacecraft attitude diverged. The incorrect diagnosis of a Gyro B fault and the subsequent ground response to this diagnosis ultimately resulted in loss of attitude control, subsequent loss of telemetry, and loss of power and thermal control. Loss of telemetry occurred at 12:43:56 AM EDT (04:43:56 UT), June 25, 1998. It can not be determined whether this loss was a consequence of insufficient power or a loss of communication link caused by spacecraft attitude. At any time during the over five hour emergency situation, the verification of the spinning status of Gyro A would have precluded the mishap. For further information, a more detailed timeline summarizing the sequence of events leading up to the mishap is provided in Appendix C. A detailed fault tree analysis supporting the above scenario and the Board's conclusions has been performed by MMS and is on file.

The shutdown due to the MCF occurred via the standard hydraulic sequence and it was a safe shutdown.

{"id": 15979, "data": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Guideline Number GT-TE-2404 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: The Fizeau interferometer is used to measure the quality of optical components and systems. It provides a guide for the manufacturing of components, an aid for alignment, and a validation of system performance. Implementation Method: Description of Fizeau Interferometer The basic layout of a Fizeau interferometer is shown in Figure 1 (Reference 1.). A laser source is spatially filtered via a microscope objective and a pinhole. This pinhole is located at the focal point of a collimating lens. Between the pinhole and lens is a beam-splitter. The collimated beam encounters a slightly wedged glass plate. This is the heart of the interferometer. The surface adjacent to the collimating lens is of good optical quality. However, the next surface is of exceptional optical quality, l/20 peak to valley (PV) or better. This is the reference surface and part of the collimated beam is reflected by this surface. Part of the collimated beam continues on to interrogate the optic being tested. The return beam contains information on aberration introduced by the test optic. The two wavefronts recombine inside the interferometer. The beam-splitter diverts the combined beams toward a recording medium, either film or a TV (CCD or vidicon). An intermediate lens together with the collimating lens forms an image of the test surface onto the recording plane. An observer will see a sharp image of the test surface with an interference (or fringe) pattern running through it. [D] Application of Fizeau Interferometer 1. Testing a Flat Suppose the test object is a plane glass surface whose quality (flatness) we wish to inspect. We must first align the test surface to the interferometer. Most commercial Fizeau interferometers have an quotalign mode.quot This requires the user to center a bright dot (the reflected return) on a crosshair on some viewing screen. Suppose the test surface has a depression in it as illustrated in Figure 2. The flat wavefront from the interferometer is incident on the test surface and reflected back into the interferometer. Note that the reflected portion shown in Figure 2 has picked up twice the surface error inherent in the test surface. This aberrated wavefront returns through the reference plate to combine with the reflected reference. [D] Wherever two coherent wavefronts overlap they interfere with each other. The equation describing interference (Reference 2) is as follows: [D] To obtain good high contrast fringes requires that the reflection off the reference and off the test piece must be equivalent in intensity. Maximum fringe contrast occurs when I1 = I2 . For example, a bare glass test surface reflects 4%. To maximize fringe contrast the reference surface must also reflect 4%. If a 4% reference surface is used to test a mirror (with 90% plus reflectivity), then a very thin beam-splitter (e.g., a pellicle) can be used to reduce the intensity from the test optic. Alternatively, a reference surface having a much higher reflectivity can be used to improve fringe contrast. In the latter case, one will notice that the dark fringes become much thinner, like sharp pencil lines. A sample interferogram of a supposed quotflatquot mirror is shown in Figure 3. If the mirror were flat, equally spaced straight line fringes should be observed (depending on the relative tilt between the reference surface and the test surface). Obviously, the mirror is not very flat at all. Each fringe is a height contour as in a topographical map. (The metric or unit of measure in most Fizeau interferometers is the wavelength of the source. For example, the helium near laser wavelength is 0.6328 microns.) The height difference between each contour or fringe is 1 wave. If knowledge of the surface error or its departure from flatness is desired, we must interpret these fringes as representing half-wave contours! [D] In addition we must know whether the pattern seen in Figure 3 is a hill or a valley on the mirror surface. This can be determined by placing your finger on the front of the reference surface metal support ring (Figure 1) and pressing lightly toward the interferometer housing. If the fringe patterns collapse or contract, the pattern represents a hill or bump. If they expand, the pattern represents a valley. 2. Testing a Lens The setup for testing a lens is illustrated in Figure 4. The lens is carefully aligned to the Fizeau beam. The beam is focused by the lens to an image point. To return the beam back to the interferometer another auxiliary reference surface is needed. In this example a small concave spherical mirror is used. This sphere should be mounted so that X,Y, and Z translation degrees of freedom are available. The center of curvature of the sphere is then made coincident with the focal point of the lens. (Be careful–make sure that the focussed beam is not on the surface of the small retro sphere). The beam is reflected by the reference sphere and returned through the system. [D] The interferogram that is initially seen is likely to be an off-center bull's eye pattern. This means that the reference sphere's center of curvature is not axially coincident with the lens focal point. Use the tip and tilt adjustments on the Fizeau reference surface to center the bull's eye as shown in Figure 5(a), then use the axial translation on the concave sphere to move the interferogram into a best null condition (i.e., minimizing the number of fringes seen over the interferogram), Figure 5(b). Now use the adjustments on the reference flat to introduce tilt fringes as shown in Figure 5(c). It should be noted that the test system has significant spherical aberration. [D] An alternate setup for testing a lens is shown in Figure 6. Here the Fizeau reference surface is a sphere. It is a specially designed positive power lens where rays emerging from the last surface of the lens are normal to that surface. The test lens is aligned to the test beam and oriented so its rear focal point is coincident with the transmission spheres focal point. The beam emerges from the lens as collimated light. A flat auxiliary referencesurface is needed to retro-reflect the test beam back to the interferometer. [D] We note that transmission spheres come in a variety of F-numbers. Since your test lens has a certain F-number, pick a transmission sphere whose F-number provides a beam that either fills or overfills the test lens. Never pick a transmission sphere that underfills because then you are not testing the lens over its full aperture. Aberration content will appear lower than it actually is. Configurations for testing a wide variety of other systems are illustrated in Figure 7. [D] 3. Retrace Error The purpose of the reference sphere in Figure 4 is to return the incoming ray back upon itself so that it follows the same path on the second pass as it did on the first pass. This occurs exactly only when the incoming beam happens to be perfect, i.e. exhibits a spherical wavefront. As aberration accumulates on the first pass through the test system, the match to the reference sphere becomes less perfect. Path deviations appear on the return ray, which is now no longer coincident with the first pass ray. The optical path difference picked up by the second pass ray is not the same as the first pass ray. This is retrace error (also called ray-mapping error) (References 1, 3 and 4). As a consequence, it is no longer true that we can simply divide the results by two to obtain the single pass wavefront aberration from double pass fringe data. There are some visual clues to indicate if retrace error is significant. First, with the room darkened, check to see that the beam diameter of the light returning through the test optic on the second-pass is the same as that for the first pass after setting the null-fringe. Second, examine the irradiance distribution of this second-pass beam at the test optic. If the second-pass beam overfills or underfills the test optic aperture, and/or the intensity distribution is nonuniform, then retrace error is significant in the test setup. To minimize the effect of retrace error, a different retro optic is usually needed. If retrace error were significant in the case illustrated in Figure 4, then a longer radius of curvature retro sphere is needed and it should be convex instead of concave. This is shown in Figure 8. The longer radius convex surface reduces the angular disparity between the incident and reflected rays. It also reduces the lateral offset between the first and second pass rays at surfaces in the test optic. [D] 4. Collecting and Handling Data It is not the purpose of this guideline to describe methods used to analyze interferograms. That deserves a guideline of its own. However, we will describe the various data collection schemes and how they interface with the analysis software. There are basically three options available to the user: 1) digitizing tablet, 2) automatic fringe following; 3) uniform grid phase measuring. The simplest and least expensive means of selecting and inputting data to an analysis code is via a digitizing tablet. A hard copy of the interferogram is placed on the tablet. The user interfaces with the tablet (and the fringe analysis code) with a digitizing pen or mouse. The code first asks the user to define the pupil. Next, data points for each fringe are entered in proper sequence from low to high contour. Once this data file is entered into the computer, the fringe code can proceed with its analysis and determine aberration content. To avoid the toil of hand digitizing, software packages are commercially available that incorporate a fringe following routine. The interferogram is imaged onto a CCD. A frame-grabber captures the fringe pattern and formats it for the computer. This intensity digitized image is then operated on by the fringe following software. It automatically generates data centered along a fringe. However, the user still must define the fringe order. An alternative approach to fringe following is a phase measuring interferometer (PMI). This is a highly automated data acquisition system. The reference plate of the Fizeau is mounted in a fixture which is piezoelectrically driven, i.e. minute cyclic axial shifts are introduced. (This is equivalent to introducing a piston into the fringe pattern.) The pupil image (with fringes across it) is recorded on a CCD. The CCD is a uniform array of sensors. Each pixel monitors the variation in local irradiance as the reference plate is moved by the actuators. Data is acquired at every pixel for four or five discrete positions of the reference plate during its sweep. This enormous amount of data is fed into a computer where the analysis software calculates the local phase at each pixel. Fringe ordering is done automatically. Plus, the huge amount of data collected on a uniform grid offers a dramatic improvement in accuracy and repeatability. Also note that this method allows the user to analyze the quotnullquot interference pattern, something the first two techniques cannot do. For a particular test setup it is usually a good idea to take four separate interferograms with fringes tilt-biased top, bottom, right, and left respectively. Fringe codes usually have an option whereby several interferograms can be averaged. An interferogram from each fringe bias is entered into the code, and the ensemble average obtained. This average is a better estimate of aberration content than any single interferogram. When testing imaging systems it is a good practice to repeat the test setup at least three times. This is because misalignments in the setup can introduce unwanted aberrations (usually coma). For each setup obtain the four fringe biased data sets mentioned above and calculate the subaverage. Then average these subaverages. 5. Environmental Constraints Vibration, whether induced through the floor into the air-isolated optical table supporting the interferometer or coupled via acoustics, is a major weakness of interferometers. This mechanical noise makes the fringe pattern unstable; it dances around at high frequency. It is hard to do meaningful interferometry under such shaky circumstances. Hence it is very important when establishing a metrology lab to locate it in a quiet area. For example, you would not want to place it between a machine shop and an optical fabrication shop. At times it may even be necessary to come in at night, when everyone else is gone and all other machines are turned off, just to get stable fringes. Another source of trouble is air currents or turbulence from air vents, or thermals (from electronic equipment for example). The fringes don't dance as with mechanical vibration but actually change shape. They meander! When an interferogram is obtained under these circumstances you are not sure how much is the test piece and how much due to changes in the refractive index in the intervening air. Shrouding the work area can be a considerable help. For example, commercial foam board from office supply houses is a useful shrouding material. Also, with a PMI, frame averaging can sometimes reduce the problem considerably. 6. Mounting Sometimes an aberration attributed to a test optic is actually induced by the manner in which the optic is held in a mount. People are sometimes afraid that an optic might fall out, so they clamp it in (or down) good and tight. As a result, the interferogram may show significant aberration (usually astigmatism) even though the optic itself is of excellent quality. So be careful, you want to constrain the test optic with a minimum of force–snug enough so that it doesn't rattle around–but loose enough to avoid stress-induced deformation. Large optics (meter class) have an additional mounting difficulty. They are usually quite heavy and can deform under their own weight (Reference 5). The fringe pattern will show significant astigmatism. Astronomical primary mirrors are particularly susceptible to this. Elaborate fixturing is sometimes required to alleviate the problem. Technical Rationale: All optics to be used on spaceborne or space-related instruments should be tested to validate their performance as required by specification. The Fizeau interferometer is the primary tool in this optical validation process. It provides the standard against which other optics are compared. Therefore proper use of a Fizeau interferometer ensures that the resulting data can be employed as a pass/fail criteria on the component or system. References J.

{"id": 15980, "data": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice Number PD-AP-1312, from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. The use of the team approach to fault-tree analysis permits a rapid, intensive, and thorough investigation of space hardware and software anomalies. This approach is specifically applicable when the solution of engineering problems is urgent and when they must be resolved expeditiously to prevent further delays in program schedules. The systematic, focused, highly participative methodology permits quick and accurate identification, recording, and solution of problems. The resulting benefits of the use of this methodology are reduction of analysis time, and precision in identifying and correcting deficiencies. The ultimate result is improved overall system reliability and safety. Implementation Method: Determination that a Team Approach to Fault-Tree Analysis is Required: In situations where program hardware or software anomalies are uncovered which could potentially reduce the possibility of mission success or cause harm to personnel, and where the pressure of schedules requires a rapid and accurate solution of problems, the team approach to fault-tree analysis should be strongly considered. Fault-trees are necessary when the system in question is complex and has many potential contributors to the problem so that the solution defies simple intuition, engineering judgement, or easy elimination of the events that contributed to the problem. The team approach to fault-tree analysis brings all disciplines to bear simultaneously in an interactive but controlled environment. A fault-tree is defined as, quota graphic depiction or model of the rationally conceivable sequences of events within a complex system that could lead ultimately to the observed failure or potential failure.quot It is a systematic approach to fault prevention achieved by postulating potential high level faults, and identifying the primary and secondary causes, down to the lowest piece-part, that could induce the high level fault. A typical arrangement of a fault-tree showing the potential types of quotgatesquot containing Boolean logic is shown on Figure 1. In situations of high urgency and cost or schedule sensitivity, it is often desirable to apply a team approach to development and use of the fault-tree methodology. [D] Fault-Tree Team Methodology: The keys to a successful team approach to a fault-tree analysis are: (1) selection of the right people to participate in the analysis; (2) interactive meetings of these people in a creative but focused environment; (3) thorough documentation of objectives, fault-tree structure, and action items; (4) parallel (but not redundant) participation by all team members; and (5) careful attention to general ground rules for effective team dynamics. All of the preceding must be backed up by a data base containing the hardware/software configuration, operational time lines, potential failure causes, and exonerating or indicting data. Logic flow networks are built based on the system's design, then laboratory test results, hardware/software test results, and modeling based on deterministic and/or probabilistic statistical analyses. These logic flow networks also feed into the information data base that is used by the fault-tree team. An integral part of successful fault-tree methodology is the selection of an orderly structure on which to base the fault-tree and the team participation. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is an ideal starting point for the team as well as for the design. Each event or activity in the WBS is subdivided into its main contributing events or activities, then the tree is subdivided again until the smallest activity that cannot be further subdivided is reached. These final events or activities are the quotleavesquot on the fault-tree. Team Composition: Given the nature of the failure or anomaly being investigated, people should be assembled who have both an intimate disciplinary knowledge and a knowledge of the overall system. Elements heads and subteam leaders should be established for major investigative elements of the work breakdown structure. Important administrative functions to support the team are: (1) the maintenance of a current address, phone, and fax listing of all persons involved; (2) recording daily team meeting minutes; (3) preparation of agenda for the next day, (prepared at the end of the current day); (4) recording of all action items including the name of the person responsible, suspense dates, and the specific action required; and (5) the maintenance of a master schedule of major planned events, based in part on the suspense dates. Team Dynamics and Work Strategy: The entire team should meet together in one location in a meeting to expose all known data related to the anomaly or failure, then the team should meet at least once per day thereafter. Action items should be assigned and as much work as possible should be done in parallel without undue redundancy. Series activities of the team should be avoided. Team interaction is important because the fault-tree is built in a dynamic, contributory fashion. During the fault-tree team activities, the team leader and scribe should keep files of action items, agendas, technical data related to development of the fault-tree, correspondence, administrative reports, the master fault-tree diagram, and the team's schedule. Top management and other related organizations should be kept informed as to the progress of the team. Hand written notes to the key players from the team leader quoten route,quot at key milestones and critical junctures, and on successful completion of the investigation are particularly helpful. Rambling discourses should be avoided. Meetings and discussions must be diplomatically kept on track. The leader should be as democratic as possible in team meetings. No one should be affronted, but in case of an impasse, the team leader must make the decision. Refreshments should be provided occasionally, especially on Saturday or Sunday and after hours. This will boost morale and provide an atmosphere conducive to free discussion. Other General Techniques and Methods: The purpose of the team approach is to provide multidisciplinary perspectives that will uncover details and to resolve cause/effect relationships which may not be apparent in more narrowly focused detailed engineering analytical and design methods. Therefore, each element of the fault-tree must be doggedly and systematically analyzed, persistently subdivided into it's smallest elements, and pursued to the lowest level. The history of these types of investigations has indicated that a methodical, vigorous assessment is needed to develop and to utilize a fault-tree of sufficient depth. This vigorous assessment will eliminate illogical assumption, identify or eliminate synergistic effects, help to avoid partial fixes and reduce intuitive or random approaches that cannot be substantiated. The team should resist the temptation to preconceive a conclusion or take on a quotpet theoryquot to the exclusion of a systematic, orderly, and vigorous treatment of all elements in the decision tree. The team should avoid any tendency to slow down the analysis process or to assume that a conclusion has been reached when a likely cause candidate has been identified, because this potential candidate could mask the true cause or divert the team's attention from a more fruitful path. Probability and statistics are important disciplines to use in the fault-tree analysis process. The team should have an appreciation of the fact that if it is necessary to stack too many possible events together to eventually postulate the occurrence of the failure, then it is improbable that it occurred in that manner. The references list several computer-aided fault-tree analysis software packages that will aid in performing the statistical analysis and informing the decision tree graphics required to document a fault-tree analysis. Technical Rationale: The team approach to fault-tree analysis described in this practice was used very successfully in a number of in-depth investigations of problems that occurred in propulsion elements of the Space Shuttle, and related facilities and equipment. The procedure was first used in full measure in the investigation of a fire in the casting pit of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) in 1984. It was also used in identifying causes of problems in the SRM propellant mix facility. Several problems and potential problems with the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) were successfully investigated using the team approach to fault-tree analysis. These investigations involved the bearings for the alternate turbopump, and a synchronous vibration problem. Hydrogen leaks in the Space Shuttle Columbia were investigated and successfully resolved in an in-depth and intensive three-month team approach to fault-tree analysis.

This suggested that the high voltage power converter developed a corona discharge and high voltage breakdown while in the critical CO2 pressure region present near the surface of Mars. [D] 1976- Voyager (ground): Design verification disclosed voids in certain capacitors which could bleed down to critical pressure after long exposure to vacuum, and could lead to a corona discharge. 1988- Galileo (ground): The vendor's vacuum chamber was purged with dry nitrogen while the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) instrument was powered. This produced a critical pressure region, corona discharge, and failure of the EUV high voltage power supply. 1989- NSCAT (ground): Windings added to a traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) transformer for test purposes, resulted in increased voltage in the primary windings, which triggered a corona discharge. 1989- Magellan (in-flight): The pyrotechnic firing which separated the solid rocket motor, used for Venus Orbit Insertion, resulted in a plasma arc, a ground current loop, and destruction of a significant amount of spacecraft memory. 1990- Mars Observer (ground): Due to inadequate insulation of the TWTA, a corona discharge occurred at critical pressure during evacuation of the vacuum chamber.

{"id": 15989, "data": "(Relevant Historical Lesson(s) Learned) A deficiency was discovered during circuit design verification which might not have shown up during testing. The condition involved capacitors having a large AC voltage between the capacitor body and its surroundings, and the capacitors having air pockets or voids between the body and the outside jacket. The finding is significant because this condition can remain harmless at atmospheric pressure, yet lead to corona and possible failure after months or years in the vacuum of space. To solve an interaction problem between the Voyager Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) and the power supply, the designer added a voltage doubler circuit having capacitors as integral parts of the circuit. The standard high-voltage capacitors initially used have the outside of the body taped to provide a moisture barrier. The doubler operates at 7.2 kHz with an input higher than 300 volts AC. The action of a voltage doubler is such that the two plates of the capacitors used change potential each time the inverter switches. The transformer winding that drives the doubler capacitors is referenced to the TWT collector through a diode bridge. Each winding output is, therefore, near collector voltage on one half cycle and changes by the transformer winding's output voltage (about 700 V) on the next half cycle. When the combined problem of the high AC voltage and the trapped air pockets was realized, the designers specified that modified capacitors, not having the tape wrapping, be procured.

{"id": 15991, "data": "During integration of the Genesis spacecraft, many flight and ground support equipment (GSE) cables were found to be electrically incompatible with spacecraft systems although they matched the cable wiring diagrams. Several times, testing had to be halted and the system analyzed for possible electrical overstress caused by power having been applied to the wrong pins. Eventually, spacecraft testing was stopped long enough to perform a pin-by-pin comparison of the cable wiring diagrams to the latest unit and system schematics. Once this was completed, errors were identified, the cables were reworked, and the problems were resolved. The accuracy of cable wiring diagrams was a continuing problem on Genesis. Typically, cables are built by cable harness shops to the specifications provided by cable drawings and cable wiring diagrams. Cable design and fabrication may take place concurrently with the design of spacecraft black boxes. As a system design evolves and pin-out requirements change, there is a time lag before the interface control drawing (ICD) is updated and the changes flow back to the cable design and documentation. Should the cables be built to an outdated document, the first powering of a given spacecraft may cause major damage. Since the connectors still mate with their assigned receptacles, the electrical mismatches may not be apparent. Validating the cable harness configuration against unit and system schematics is a very time-consuming activity. If it is delayed until integration and test has already commenced, the task can impact the project schedule.

{"id": 15992, "data": "This Lessons Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1209; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: Heat pipes use the latent heat of vaporization of a working fluid to transfer heat efficiently at a nearly constant temperature. This characteristic can be used to control the temperature of spacecraft components and systems. The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has chosen ammonia-charged aluminum heat pipes for most near-room temperature (200°K to 350°K) applications. The axial groove aluminum pipe is the design of choice, because it is easy to design and relatively easy to fabricate. The aluminum container and axial grooves are extruded in one process. At the operating temperature of unmanned spacecraft, ammonia has the most favorable thermodynamic properties that make it an excellent heat pipe working fluid. Anhydrous ammonia is compatible with the aluminum heat pipe body and wick if proper care is taken in the manufacturing process. Implementation Method: All heat pipes have three physical elements in common. These include an outer container, a small amount of working fluid, and a capillary wick structure. In addition to these basic components, heat pipes may also include gas reservoirs (variable conductance/diode heat pipes) and liquid or gas traps (diodes). Functionally, the heat pipe consists of three sections: evaporator, condenser section, and adiabatic regions. The evaporator section is mounted to the heat-producing components, while the condenser is thermally coupled to a heat sink or radiator. The adiabatic section allows heat to be transferred from the evaporator to the condenser with very small heat losses and temperature drops. Figure 1 depicts the basic heat pipe. [D] Heat pipes can operate in the fixed conductance, variable conductance, or diode mode. The fixed conductance heat pipe can transfer heat in either direction and operates over broad temperature ranges, but has no inherent temperature control capability. Constant conduction heat pipes allow isothermalization of shelves, radiators and structures; spread heat from high heat dissipating components; and conduct heat away from heat producing devices embedded within instruments and satellites. In the variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP), a small quantity of non-condensable gas (NCG) is loaded into the heat pipe. The VCHP can be used to control the temperature of equipment within very narrow limits; control is possible to less than 1°K by using careful design techniques. This is accomplished by controlling the location of the NCG/vapor interface within the condenser end of the heat pipe, thereby varying the active length of the condenser and causing a modulation in the condenser heat rejection capability. Temperature control of the attached device is achieved by an active feedback system consisting of a temperature sensor at the heat source and a controller for a heater at the NCG reservoir. The heater causes the gas in the reservoir to expand, thus moving the gas/vapor interface. Diode heat pipes permit heat to flow in one direction and inhibit heat flow in the opposite direction. Specific benefits of heat pipes are: 1) heat pipes have enormously more heat transfer capability than other methods on a weight and size basis, 2) heat pipes permit configuration flexibility in contact areas with heat sources and heat sinks, 3) heat can be transported over considerable distances with insignificant temperature drop, 4) capillary pumping in the wick is generated by the heat transfer process and requires no other power or moving parts to pump the condensate, and 5) heat pipes operate satisfactorily in a zero gravity environment. The choice of working fluid is dictated by several considerations, including operating temperature, latent heat of vaporization, liquid viscosity, toxicity, chemical compatibility with container material, wicking system design, and performance requirements. Figures 2 and 3 and Table 1 depict some of the above characteristics for several fluids. The highest performance from a heat pipe is obtained by utilizing a working fluid that has a high surface tension (s), a high latent heat (l), and a low liquid viscosity (n1). These fluid properties are contained in the parameter N1 the Liquid Transport Factor. Figure 4 is a plot of N1 for five typical heat pipe working fluids. These data are used as selection criteria for heat pipe working fluids. Once an application is defined, the heat pipe designer reviews the requirements and selects the best working fluid. Below the freezing point of water and above about 200°K, ammonia is an excellent working fluid. Regardless of the fluid chosen, minimum purity must be at least 99.999 percent. A careful analysis of the purity of the ammonia should be obtained from an independent laboratory prior to use.

The chosen design and processing of the container are extremely important in selecting the metal, because they can affect the useful life of the heat pipe. In addition, a compatibility must exist between the pipe material and the working fluid. For heat pipes, working fluid/container compatibility issues encompass any chemical reactions or diffusion processes occurring between the fluid and wall/wick materials that can lead to gas formation and/or corrosion. Table 2 lists the compatibilities of several metals and working fluids. Along with the metal/fluid compatibility, other considerations in the metal selection are ease of working the material, extrusion capability of the material, and its weldability. Proper container cleaning and heat pipe processing procedures are of extreme importance, since residual contamination within the heat pipe may also lead to gas generation. Steps must also be taken to ensure the purity of the fluid charge; trace amounts of water in ammonia can lead to a reaction with the aluminum container and the formation of hydrogen gas. Chi [reference 1] and B & K Engineering [reference 2] list standard cleaning and filling methods for a variety of working fluid/wall material combinations. Special consideration must be given to the processing of heat pipes to be used at temperatures below 250°K. As the temperature drops, the vapor pressure of the fluid falls off. This allows any non-condensable gas created by contamination to expand, thus creating an even larger problem. The heat pipe wick structure provides a porous medium for the formation of liquid menisci (which cause the capillary pumping action) and a vehicle for returning the working fluid from the condenser to the evaporator. To accomplish these wick functions effectively, the designer must provide pores, cavities, or channels of the right size, shape, quantity and location. An optimization technique is used in wick design to find the desired combination of ultimate heat transfer capacity, pumping capability, and temperature drop. The designer must also consider ease of wick fabrication, compatibility with the working fluid, wetting angle and permeability of the selected wick material. Figure 5 depicts a cross-sectional view of an axial groove wick; this design probably is the most commonly used for space application. [D] In addition, X-ray certification of all welds at the end caps and fill tube is required to ensure good weld penetration and the absence of voids. The heat pipe container must be pressure tested to at least twice its maximum expected operating pressures (MEOP) prior to filling [reference 3]. Other qualification procedures include performance tests at adverse tilt angles to demonstrate proper wick function, and gas pocket tests performed with the heat pipe in the reflux mode. Heat pipes should be handled with care, especially those that contain ammonia or other high vapor pressure fluids. They should be treated as any other pressure vessel, and appropriate safety precautions must be exercised. Exposure to ammonia vapor can cause severe irritation to eyes and other mucous membranes. Exposure to ammonia liquid can cause severe burns to the skin. Whenever possible, heat pipes should be stored in a cold, dry environment. This will inhibit any internal chemical reactions which produce non-condensable gas. Technical Rationale: Spacecraft applications to date have been for heat pipes operating between 200°K and 350°K. Consequently, a working fluid whose freezing and boiling points encompass this temperature range and has a high latent heat, a low viscosity, and high heat transport capability must be selected. GSFC has selected ammonia as an appropriate working fluid whose fluid properties meet these criteria. However, for safety reasons, the toxicity of ammonia precludes its use in manned environments such as the shuttle cabin [reference 4]. GSFC has selected aluminum alloys, such as 6061 and 6063, for the container material of the heat pipe because of their long-term compatibility with ammonia (see Table 2); heritage; ability to have an extruded axial groove wick structure; ease of fabrication, shaping, and configuring; good thermal compatibility with aluminum radiators and heat sinks; and weldability characteristics.

{"id": 15994, "data": "Shortly after separation of the Wide-Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) spacecraft from the launch vehicle, venting of the secondary cryogen tank was commanded, as planned, to dissipate the heat absorbed by the cryogen since termination of ground cooling. Venting this small amount of hydrogen gas was expected to induce some tumbling of the spacecraft. This tumbling was also expected to be quickly dampened by the attitude control system as the solid hydrogen reached equilibrium with the low space-ambient temperature. Instead, the spacecraft was observed to be tumbling too fast to be countered by the reaction wheels and magnetic torquers--an out-of-control condition. A NASA review board determined (reference 1) that an error in the design of the pyro electronics caused premature release of the telescope cover when the secondary cryogen tank was vented. The cover release permitted a large heat load into the cryostat that caused greater and more prolonged cryogen venting then expected following the transient associated with secondary vent actuation. A \"T\" fitting had been placed at the vent outlet to balance the thrust induced to the spacecraft by the gas flow expected from the planned venting sequence. However, design analysis did not consider the torque effects of worst case transient flows caused by one side of the \"T\" pointing directly at a connector (added as a late design modification during integration). The combined applied torque to the spacecraft from the initial secondary vent transient and the effects of early cover release was greater than the attitude control system capability. An independent analysis performed by a member of the WIRE JPL Review Board (reference 1, appendix E, p. 91) indicated the possibility that the normal secondary vent actuation transient could have exceeded attitude control capability. This could significantly impact early science return since it would take many days to reestablish a stable spacecraft attitude. Venting analyses performed during the design phase considered only the steady state cryogen flows expected during primary mission science pointing. However, the premature release of the instrument cover, and resultant boil-off of the cryogen required for telescope operation, was determined by the review board to be the direct cause of the WIRE mission loss (references 1 and 2). It was also determined that the design characteristics of the cryogen tank vent outlet prevented timely control of spacecraft attitude following the cover release anomaly, and the venting-induced torque deterred any productive efforts to save the mission.

NASA, ESA, and NRL scientists queried by the media were excited, and their excitement about the new observations led to media reports that a massive ejection had left the Sun (true), it would hit the Earth (highly probable), at a certain time (wrong), and cause damage and outages to technical systems (highly unlikely.) Meantime, NOAA's Space Environment Center (SEC), utilizing primarily the same types of data with which we have become familiar over the last several solar cycles, regarded the flare (C6 in soft x-rays and 3N in H-alpha) to be ordinary, the coronal mass ejection to be the expected garden variety, time of transit to Earth through slow solar wind to be long, and the terrestrial effects likely to be unremarkable. The unprecedented media saturation and attention gives to this event, and the \"NASA predictions\" (which NASA scientists did not make) appearing as an official government warning, caused many systems operators to be severely shaken, As on example, NOAA's Space Environment Center had a call asking if 747s scheduled to fly across the Atlantic should be kept on the ground at the predicted time of arrival of the storm.

{"id": 16021, "data": "MSL has two lithium ion batteries that are recharged several times per day. These batteries enable the Curiosity rover’s power subsystem to meet the peak power demands of Rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level of ~100 watts. The flight computers (labeled “RCEs” in Figure 1) are always shut down prior to these recharge cycles. Figure 1. MSL avionics subsystem Six months after landing on Mars (i.e., Mars sol-200), telemetry reported uncorrectable errors in the NAND flash memory (Reference (1)). Analysis revealed that several flight software (FSW) tasks had hung up, leading to an inability of the prime computer (Rover Compute Element (RCE) ‘A’) to turn off for its normal recharge session. Normally, fault protection would intervene: a watchdog timer would count down to zero and trigger a computer reboot. Instead, the watchdog timers were being reset. This could inexorably lead to a power brown-out of the Rover in three to six days: such loss of commandability that leaves the Rover discharging is a potentially mission-catastrophic event. Within 16 hours of the initial error message, mission controllers at the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) bypassed the FSW and commanded a swap from RCE-A to the backup computer (RCE-B). Tones (i.e., “signals”) were subsequently received from the Rover confirming that the “backup” string had become “prime” and had entered safe mode. Information that the new prime computer gathered from the failed computer indicated that errors in the FSW had exacerbated a hardware fault in the flash memory. The MSL Flight Team faced a situation where the Rover was effectively left with “single string” avionics only 35 days prior to the Mars solar conjunction (when the spacecraft would not be commandable for 25 sols). Also, since the same FSW and flash memory were present in the new prime computer (RCE-B), the remaining string was of questionable reliability. Failure investigation indicated that a single chip in the flash memory array was generating errors during erase cycles, likely due to a connectivity problem on the circuit board, or due to infant mortality of the commercial part. (Pre-flight testing had only erased the NAND ~12 times, as compared to an additional 38 erases (Reference (2)) after launch. The NAND part should have a life of 100,000 cycles.) Spacecraft functionality was recovered by segregating the bad flash memory; a direct hardware reset then rebooted RCE-A to operate with a half-size flash file system. (Because the data storage volume was sized with substantial margin, the loss of half the memory does not impact the mission.) Also, an additional (maximum up-time) watchdog timer was added to the flight software to strengthen fault protection. However, JPL would have been unable to diagnose the problem were it not for an avionics architecture that allowed the non-prime computer to be powered and providing telemetry on its “health” even when the (RAM-based) FSW was not running on it.

Within six orbits after observance of the anomaly, communication with the spacecraft was found not to be possible and no downlink signal from the spacecraft was thereafter detected. Upon closer examination of recorded spacecraft telemetry data, it was ascertained that the solar array was putting out electrical power, but that no power was being provided to the battery charging unit, and the batteries were not receiving a charge. Cause of the failure surmised by the cognizant operations crew and concluded by the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) NOAA-13 Failure Review Board, was that the solar array bus had shorted to spacecraft ground. Specifically, constant thermal expansion and contraction in excess of previous flights was thought to have caused one or more mounting bolts protruding through the heat sink contained in the battery charging unit to penetrate isolation material and short the solar array output to ground.

{"id": 16033, "data": "In May 2009, a wheeled shipping crate containing an electrical ground support equipment (EGSE) rack for the Aquarius project fell off the lift gate of a contracted commercial transportation van while being unloaded. The van was parked adjacent to the receiving dock at the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). After the crate was moved to the rear of the vehicle for unloading, the van driver/operator manipulated the incorrect control on the powered lift gate (Reference (1)). (Figure 1 illustrates the lift gate control system's susceptibility to operator error.) This caused the lift gate to tilt instead of lower. The crate rolled off the lift gate and struck the ground, damaging the hinges and breaking off the lid. Only the crate directly contacted the ground, and the EGSE rack with its 2-inch thick foam padding remained secure within the crate. The shipping crate had four casters, but the locks on the two downhill casters were unlocked during the operation. Figure 1. Lift gate control panel on the truck that was unloading Aquarius EGSE. The diagram below the image shows that the control panel is not well designed to deter operator error. (The yellow label indicates that the dial on the right is a “Slider” control that positions the gate horizontally.) The EGSE rack was being removed from the vehicle because it had not been approved in the final manifest for support equipment to be transported to Argentina for Aquarius integration and test. Since a need to unload the EGSE shipping crate had been not identified to the project until just prior to the incident, there was insufficient time to coordinate and plan the EGSE off-load. Quality Assurance was present during the incident, but System Safety was not notified of this unplanned unloading of Aquarius EGSE. Two individuals were injured as a result of this incident. The first struck his head on the pavement when he fell backward while avoiding the falling equipment. The other suffered a muscle strain while trying to restrain the EGSE rack as it rolled off the tilted lift gate. The container and lid were then moved into the Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) airlock for visual inspection. Visual inspection did not detect any equipment damage other than the detached shipping container lid, and the damaged shipping crate was replaced. The personnel were treated with basic first-aid, and then they returned to work (Reference (2)). The test equipment required recalibration, full functional test, and internal visual inspection. Due to a lingering concern about possible damage, however, replacement EGSE was obtained for use with Aquarius flight equipment (Reference (3)). There exists some residual concern by the Aquarius project due to the risk posed by plans to move JPL Critical Items (JCI) from Argentina to Brazil, and from Brazil to the Vandenberg Air Force Base launch site. JPL has recently revamped the process of preparing and reviewing transportation plans. The process is now reflected in the formal procedures of JPL Security, and preparation of a transportation plan is now a contractual requirement to be added to JPL subcontracts (Reference (4)). Also, the JPL Project and Engineering Management Committee (PEMC) has approved adding a transportation plan requirement to the next release of the JPL Flight Project Practices.

Hypergolic rocket propellants have proven to be a highly reliable asset in manned and unmanned spaceflight; however, their maintenance on the ground has proven to be relatively difficult. Do the operational risks from possible human errors or hardware failures causing a catastrophic incident outweigh the usefulness of hypergols even though they have been used for the last 50 years of manned and unmanned spaceflight?

The crew consisted of 7 members, including commander, pilot, 3 mission specialists, 1 payload commander, and 1 payload specialist. The TSS-1R payload was a reflight of TSS-1 in 1994, where deployer mechanism problems limited the tether deployment to slightly less than 300 m. The planned duration of the flight was 14 days. The payload bay configuration consisted of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) experiments, two U.S. Microgravity Lab pallets (USMP-3), Orbiter Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE) pallet, and Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) pallet. Deployment of the satellite began at 56/20:46 GMT. On 57/01:29:26 GMT, at a tether length of 19.7 km, the satellite tether broke within the 12 m deployer boom, and the satellite separated from the orbiter. The rate of tether deployment was under control of the science computer. At the time of the tether separation, the deployment rate was being ramped down, per timeline, in preparation for halting at 20.7 km tether length. The tether deployment rate was approximately 1 m/s when it separated. There were no injuries and no damage to the orbiter or its subsystems due to the tether break. The orbiter was located at 2 degrees N latitude and 100.4 degrees W longitude, and was at an altitude of 296 km (160 nautical miles) at the time of tether break. The TSS-1R experiments were in the passive mode, with no current flowing in the tether. The tether had an electric potential of -3500 VDC with respect to the orbiter ground, as planned, during this mode. Telemetry from the orbiter and the satellite was operating prior to, during, and after the tether separation. Video imagery of the tether was available after the separation, but no video coverage exists showing the break itself. Video and still photography were taken during the mission of the failed end of the tether within the boom. The tether remaining in the boom was rewound on the reel during the mission. Post flight inspection of the tether end showed it to be charred, with an apparent final tension failure of a few strands of Kevlar. The TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board established that the tether failed as a result of arcing and burning of the tether, leading to a tensile failure after a significant portion of the tether had burned away. Pictures of the frayed tether end The arc started in the Lower Tether Control Mechanism (LTCM), resulting in a 1 A current discharge to orbiter ground in the LTCM. This event occurred during a passive mode of science operations, with -3500 VDC on the tether conductor. The arc continued intermittently for 9 s, as the breached part of the tether traversed at 1 m/s through the remaining deployer mechanisms and into the 12 m deployer boom, where the space plasma provided the current return path. This arcing produced significant burning of most of the tether material in the area of the arc. The nominal load on the tether, 65 N (15 lb.), finally separated the tether at the burn location, while it was within the deployer boom. The upper tether section was pulled through the Upper Tether Control Mechanism (UTCM), away from the orbiter at a speed of 3 m/s, due to tether dynamics and the satellite movement away from the orbiter. The lower section of the tether remained within the boom, and was recovered after the flight. The arc initiated at a breach in the FEP insulation layer of the tether. Pressure within the LTCM, the proximity to a ground plane at the LTCM entry pulley, and the high voltage on the conductor, provided the favorable environment based on pressure-distant relationships (Paschen's Law)* for the conductor to arc through the breach in the tether insulation. Although the damaged area of the insulation was destroyed due to burning, the TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board found sufficient evidence from test and analysis to establish foreign object penetration, or damage to the FEP insulation layer in manufacturing or handling, as the probable cause of the breach of the insulation layer. See the following videos: [D] The satellite and tether moving away from the shuttle [D] Scan of the boom with the slack tether in the shuttle cargo bay Manufacturing and inspection records show that the tether fabrication task was very difficult, and that numerous problems were encountered in the extrusion and braiding processes of this very long tether. The fabrication of the tether was carried out in a normal manufacturing shop environment. Metallic and non-metallic contamination was found within the FEP insulation layer of the flight tether, including the 9 m that had gone through the lower deployer mechanisms prior to the failure. Non-metallic and metallic contamination was also found between the Nomex and insulator layers of several samples of flight tether. EDS analysis revealed foreign material near the failed end. In addition to the contamination found within the tether, debris was found in several locations within the deployer mechanism. Metallic debris, large enough to breach the FEP, was found in the LTCM, the deployer boom assembly, and the reel housing. In the LTCM, a small piece of very fine silver plated wire, aluminum shavings, and unidentified non-metallic debris were found. Small metallic shavings were found attached to the back of small screw holes in the boom assembly. Damage to the copper conductor was found in both the returned flight tether, and in a section of qualification tether examined after a special spark test. This damage appeared to have taken place during fabrication of the tether. The final wind of the tether onto the flight reel was at a tether tension of 50 N. This results in high compression forces on the tether layers deep within the reel. The TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board calculated that compressive forces at the layer where the tether breach was located, were as high as 35 N/mm for several days after the winding process. This compressive force is more than sufficient to force small debris through the insulation layer of the tether. The TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board found one contributing cause was that the degree of vulnerability of the tether insulation to damage was not fully appreciated. A second contributing cause was high voltage effects on the insulator itself. Concern over the environment inside the LTCM led to the analyses involving Pashcen's Law relating voltage break down propensity as a function of the pressure-distance parameter. * - In 1889 Paschen introduced a generalization to the complex subject of gas break down in the law bearing his name. This law states simply that in a uniform field the sparking potential of a gas depends only upon the product of the gas pressure and the electrode separation. The TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board was able to conclusively eliminate several major areas as causal.

It employed new approaches for interface definition and control which produced both good and bad results. In simplifying the expensive serial engineering change request (ECR) process, a dedicated JPL interface control drawing (ICD) coordinator was responsible for change control and for assuring that interface changes were approved by cognizant engineers. In addition, the Project Engineering Team met weekly to review all changes. Problems occurred during MPF spacecraft integration and test, however, due to out-of-date or incomplete interface documentation: Electrical connector discrepancies were found between the MPF main wiring harness (delivered in July 1995) and 7 connectors on circuit boards in the Attitude and Information Management (AIM) subsystem. Investigation showed that the main wiring harness was built in accordance with MICDs which had not been updated after interfacing circuit board connectors were changed. This resulted in a connector mismatch--non-mating male-to-male and female-to-female connections. No power subsystem cabling was involved, and the discrepancies were corrected by retrofitting the cabling, or in some cases the boards, before any damage had occurred.

{"id": 16040, "data": "Recently on a Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) spacecraft program, a contractor had concluded successful live fire tests on the EEDs (Electrical Explosive Devices, also called Pyros). Subsequently it was found that the live fire tests had not only fired the EEDs but had also damaged the drive circuit. The damaged component was the EED circuit fusing element. This component would not provide sufficient energy to fire an EED when required during the mission. This then could have resulted in failure to fire EEDs during the mission. GSFC engineering had mandated that the drive circuit be tested after the live fire test. This drive circuit test was to demonstrate the drive circuit vitality. Fortunately, the mandated tests were done, the damaged parts found and appropriate corrective measures taken. The last paragraph of this document contains a test recommendation to preclude launching with a \"dead\" EED system (typical I&T EED tests may appear to be successful but the typical test can actually damage the EED drive circuit). This paragraph was written as an executive summary with the last paragraph being the summary recommendation. The other paragraphs provide more detailed information on the problem. Early concerns about the Pyro circuit design included unconventional EMI shielding, unconventional EED firing via a ground pulse, firing current sustained after initiation, overcurrent protection by using a resistor (current-time curves were not available from the contractor), and the safing plug location that precludes verification of EED status. The Contractor maintained that the design was the same as that used repeatedly on all of their programs. (It was subsequently discovered that the fire pulse design has not been consistent on their programs.) The contractor also maintained that the design minimized hazard risks and therefore was acceptable. They were insistent that since they had already fabricated the assemblies a change to the design would substantially impact the program. GSFC insisted that as a minimum after any EED test firing, the Contractor must conduct a test to verify the resistance value of the EED fusing resistors. No change was made by the contractor to alter the unconventional EED firing via a ground pulse. [D] During the tests to verify the resistance value of the EED fusing resistor, it was discovered that in one channel the fusing resistor value was 15 times the required value. Therefore, the fusing resistor would no longer activate a flight installed EED. When the assembly was opened, the resistor was found to be charred. Evidence points to this being a result of EED firing via a ground pulse and the EED establishing an internal path to ground that resulted in a sustained current until the pre-arm/arm path was interrupted by fusing resistor failure. Another fusing resistor was also discolored but had the correct resistance value. The discolored resistor was then further tested to confirm that it could provide additional adequate fire pulses. The Contractor did limited testing and confirmed that the discolored (but correct resistance) fusing resistor was capable of repeatedly providing fire pulses with adequate energy. This result appears to confirm that a measurement of resistance value was adequate to determine drive circuit functionality. The mechanism for the damage appears to be the ground firing pulse combined with the known effect of EED shorting to case during discharge. The enclosed figure is a simplified diagram of the ground firing pulse configuration. The prearm and arm contacts are closed or opened by ground command for extended periods. The duration of positive voltage application is mostly dependent upon intervening operations. However, a minimum duration on the order of a few hundred milliseconds would be expected from the contractor's implementation. The fire pulse is a 40 ms ground activation pulse. If the prearm and arm commands are executed, the EED only needs the fire pulse ground connection to initiate. Once the fire pulse occurs then a \"sneak\" circuit can occur internal to the EED by either the bridge wire shorting to the EED case or by a low resistance plasma path to the case (information seems to indicate that this kind event occurs in about 4 percent of EEDs). If this happens, high current will flow until either the fusing resistor opens or the prearm or arm functions are deactivated. A short duration fire pulse on the positive voltage side would not have caused fusing resistor damage. If the fire pulse were placed on the positive side of the circuit instead of the ground side a high surge current could still occur but only for the duration of the 40ms fire pulse instead of the much longer duration of the prearm and arm relays.", "label": [[384, 413, "MOD"], [335, 361, "CAU"], [278, 303, "CAU"], [496, 516, "MOD"], [576, 599, "CON"], [714, 728, "CON"], [2109, 2136, "CON"], [2285, 2313, "CON"], [2794, 2817, "EFF"], [2730, 2748, "MOD"], [2629, 2658, "CAU"], [2667, 2710, "CAU"], [3367, 3386, "CAU"], [3421, 3458, "CAU"], [309, 326, "CAU"]], "Lesson ID": 448}

{"id": 16044, "data": "In order to mitigate seal extrusion-related failures in the Primary Reaction Control System (PRCS) pilot-operated valve (POV), an effort was undertaken to develop a redesigned POV (RPOV) pilot seat assembly. The POV controls the flow of hypergolic liquid propellants to the Space Shuttle Orbiter attitude control thrusters. Specifications and selection assistance from suppliers were found to be inadequate for choosing an appropriate grade of PTFE for seal material without further testing. The two PTFE resins under consideration had similar properties per current material procurement specifications. For example, the dimensional stability, tensile strength, and percent elongation requirements were virtually the same. Meaningful properties such as dimensional stability under load (creep), retention of properties at higher operational temperatures, and chemical resistance to propellants were not covered. Resin selection design assistance from commercial resin suppliers for specific applications such as a thruster valve seal was found to be lacking. Resin candidates were also hard to distinguish by most laboratory tests, but each candidate was later found to exhibit unique physical and mechanical properties that made the difference between fabricating a viable versus non-viable seal. Initial RPOV seal fabrication efforts focused on using a pre-sintered, free-flowing extrusion molding PTFE grade per AMS 3658 [1], sold under the trademark of Algoflon(r)-E2 [2]. Seals made from Algoflon-E2 exhibited significant splotchiness, microcracking, and fibrillation after the hot-forming assembly process and seal recession after valve testing. To resolve these issues, an as-sintered, non-free-flowing compression molding PTFE per AMS 3660 [3], sold under the trademark of Teflon(r)-7A [4], was used. [D] Figure 1. Redesigned pilot seal showing overall splotchy appearance and fibrillation around seal id and od after trimming Given the limited utility of material procurement specifications, a squeeze test which allowed the compressive strain to be varied from 15 to 90 percent was devised to better differentiate between resins. Specimens made from the pre-sintered, free-flowing Algoflon-E2 resin produced a lower strength PTFE that was more susceptible to fracturing (Figure 2, bottom). Since Algoflon-E2 consists of coarse, agglomerated particles, fracturing was attributed to adhesive failure along resin particle boundaries. By comparison, a specimen made from the as-sintered, non-free-flowing resin gradually transitioned from fully opaque to translucent material without any evidence of fracturing or splotchiness.

{"id": 16051, "data": "The Space Shuttle was developed by NASA to be a largely reusable launch system which could provide frequent access to low earth orbit. Like all previous launch systems, safe reentry for the crew and payload required the use of a thermal protection system (TPS). Unlike previous spacecraft though, the Shuttle’s TPS was exposed from launch, making it sensitive to debris which could be generated by the vehicle on ascent. The most likely and potentially destructive source of debris was considered to be ice, which could build-up anywhere on the External Tank (ET) where there was exposed metal. Ice could form during ground operations after the cryogenic propellants had been loaded and then be knocked loose on ascent. In order to prevent both ice build-up and boil-off of the propellants, the entire ET and all protuberances (orbiter attach points, pressurization lines, propellant feed lines, etc.) were covered with a spray on foam insulation (SOFI) type TPS. Unfortunately the foam was also susceptible to liberation during ascent, and posed a debris risk of its own. In February of 2003, during ascent on STS-107, an ~2 pound piece of foam was liberated from the left ET bipod and impacted the leading edge of Columbia’s left wing. The resulting damage to the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon TPS in that location was severe enough that on reentry a jet of hot gas was able to enter the vehicle. The eventual structural failure of the wing and resultant loss of control led to vehicle break-up, and the loss of the entire crew. Following the Columbia tragedy the Space Shuttle fleet was grounded for two and a half years to determine the root cause of the incident and implement the necessary design changes. On July 26, 2005, Space Shuttle Discovery launched on the Return to Flight (RTF) mission, STS-114. On ascent, the ET shed foam from numerous locations, where the largest piece was twenty-five times greater than the certified limit. The shuttle fleet was grounded again and two separate in-flight anomaly (IFA) teams were established to determine the root cause of each piece of debris. On June 26, 2006 the Space Shuttle Program held the STS-121 Flight Readiness Review (FRR).

{"id": 16052, "data": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1257; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Proper design of solid rocket motor case-to-case field joints reduces joint rotation and potential leakage during ignition and operation. With detailed dynamic loads analyses, thermal analyses, careful insulation design, and suitable quotoquot-ring sealing, the leakage of hot combustion gasses through field joints is eliminated. This prevents potentially catastrophic burning or melting of the solid rocket motor and adjacent metal components. Similar benefits are obtained by using improved design practices for case-to-nozzle joints and factory joints between case segments. Implementation Method: 1. Background The Challenger accident (Space Shuttle Flight #51L) which was caused by the escape of hot gasses from case-to-case field joints in the SRM, triggered an in-depth, detailed review of analytical, design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing methods for solid rocket motor field and factory assembly joints. The case-to-case field joint was the primary target of the investigations and subsequent redesign efforts. However, other joints in the motor such as the case-to-nozzle joint and the factory joint between motor segments were thoroughly investigated and redesigned when the investigation allowed for optimization of the noted configurations. Reliable joint performance was achieved by a detailed review of the design drives and by comprehensive analysis, test, and redesign processes. 2. Case-to-Case Field Joint Improvements Space Shuttle Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRMs) are made up of four segments in which propellant is cast in monolithic form. The four segments are connected by the field joint shown in cross-section on Figure 1. The case portion of each segment consists of two cylinders connected in the center by a factory joint. A dynamic launch and flight load analysis confirmed that the field joint design, which has been the main focus of attention, needed to be modified after the Challenger accident to incorporate several improvements. The most significant of these improvements was the addition of a quotcapturequot feature, which is essentially an added circumferential band that is incorporated as an integral part of the quottangquot on the male side of the three case-to-case field joints. This capture feature creates an interference fit with the inner clevis surface and restricts the movement of the tang away from the two quotoquot-rings on the internal leg of the field joints during initial motor pressurization. The capture feature also incorporates a third quotoquot-ring which potentially serves as a heat barrier to the combustion process, in event of anomalous insulation performance. In addition to the change in the metal parts, the configuration of the internal insulation interface between adjacent segments was changed to permit an interference fit between adjoining insulation elements. This insulation joint is bonded with a pressure sensitive adhesive around its full circumference, and aided in its contact during motor operation with a circumferential quotJquot shaped pressurizing slot in the tang insulation. With the addition of the capture feature and its quotoquot-ring, a second leak check port, which also serves as a vent during assembly and a means of positioning of the primary quotoquot-ring, was added in the redesigned joint. This ensured that a redundant seal existed in the new design. A quotV-2quot fluorocarbon filler material was placed at the clevis tip between the primary and tang quotoquot-rings to reduce the free volume of the joint and limit the quantity of hot gas that would enter the joint in the event of leakage of the quotJquot seal and capture feature quotoquot-ring. In the new design, the inner clevis leg surface is machined to provide a sealing surface for the capture feature quotoquot-ring. The compression of both the primary and secondary quotoquot-rings was increased by increasing the quotoquot-ring diameter by 0.010 inch from the pre-Challenger configuration, and the quotoquot-ring grooves were widened by 0.005 inch to prevent four wall contact by the quotoquot-ring. All sealing surfaces were smoothed to an average roughness of 63 micro inches (63 millionths of an inch). A chamfered clevis leg was provided to aid in the assembly process. Each field joint in the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor is connected by pins (a cross sectional drawing of one of these pins appears on Figure 1). A key reliability enhancement feature is an increased-length pin with a circumferential pin retainer band. Each pin includes a hole which assists in assembly, and an opening with a dovetail cross-section to assist in pin extraction for refurbishment after flight. The increased pin length causes the dovetail to lie outboard at the outer clevis leg outside diameter. A stress analysis confirmed that this would reduce unit area shear stress on the pin because the dovetail is outside of the high shear area. This modification eliminated the potential for pin deformation. Custom shims were inserted between the inside surface of the outer clevis leg and the outside surface of the tang to maintain a constant gap between the two surfaces and to limit the growth of the metal-to-metal gap at the primary and secondary quotoquot-rings during pressurization. [D] 3. Case-to-Nozzle Joint Improvements Concurrent with the improvements in the case-to-case field joints, case-to-nozzle joints were also improved to obtain higher reliability and to achieve a more robust design. Changes to the insulation configuration, joint adhesive material, quotoquot-ring and quotoquot-ring groove configurations, and the nozzle attachment fasteners provide positive assurance of sealing. As in the instance of the insulation surrounding the case-to-case field joints, a pressurizing slot in the case insulation, coupled with a layer of sealant between the case and nozzle insulation, provides protection against combustion gasses reaching the nozzle or case metal parts. A circumferential slot is located in the case insulation near the interface between the case and nozzle insulation. A circumferential flow baffle is installed in this slot to prevent erosion of the insulation, and a stress-relieving radius former is included at the base of this slot to prevent cracking. To provide an additional margin for reliability, polysulfide adhesive material is used to bond the carbon phenolic nozzle insulation material to the asbestos/silica-filled, nitrile butadiene rubber insulation in the rocket motor case. A wiper quotoquot-ring in the glass phenolic layer of the nozzle insulation and wiper vent slot in the rubber case insulation were incorporated to prevent entrapment of air in the case-to-nozzle joint during assembly, and to prevent the polysulfide adhesive from contaminating the primary quotoquot-ring. The wiper quotoquot-ring also provided the second of two barriers (the first is the polysulfide material in the insulation joint) to inhibit gas flow to the primary seal. Stress analysis studies and strength testing proved that radial bolts, as well as longitudinal bolts, were required to ensure an impenetrable seal between the nozzle and case metal parts under all environmental and motor performance conditions. Radial bolts ensure that sufficient compression of the primary quotoquot-ring is maintained to provide effective sealing. Increasing the diameter of the quotoquot-ring and redimensioning the quotoquot-ring groove to provide optimum quotoquot-ring squeeze while preventing quotoquot-ring entrapment were required reliability enhancement measures in the RSRM case-to-nozzle joint. 4. Factory Case-to-Case Joints Custom shims, widened quotoquot-ring grooves, slightly larger quotoquot-rings, increased pin length, and revised pin retainer bands were improvements made in the factory case-to-case joints. Because of the continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints, special joint provisions were not required in the insulation. Clevis legs were chamfered and undercut at the leg tips for consistent final configurations after assembly. Technical Rationale: Based on detailed analyses of key design and manufacturing/assembly drivers, the SRM case-to-case field joints have exhibited satisfactory performance in close to 100 solid rocket motors since the Challenger accident without evidence of hot propellant gas leakage through the insulation to the joint sealing system. The critical parameters associated with the case-to-case field joint, case-to-case factory joint, case-to-nozzle joint, and ignition system mounting joints continue to be closely monitored on a flight-to-flight basis to prevent the occurrence of undesirable hot gas transmission through any of the multiple seals provided.

{"id": 16055, "data": "Background: In October 2001 the Payload Safety Review Panel (PSRP) conducted the phase III flight safety review for the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) payload. During the safety review, the PSRP discovered that one of the MSG client payloads, a vibration attenuation device, did not address touch temperature hazards in the event of degradation or loss of an ISS critical service - cooling by the ISS Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL). The client payload was mounted inside the MSG work volume and utilized the ISS Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL) for cooling. The payload organization's (PO) thermal analysis did not cover the MTL failure scenario. The PSRP directed the PO to perform additional thermal analysis for the MTL failure case. The new analysis revealed that the client payload's baseplate could reach a maximum temperature of 68 deg Celsius (154 deg Fahrenheit) which exceeded the NSTS/ISS 18798B Interpretation Letter (MA2-95-048) maximum allowable temperature (49 deg C) requirement for intentional crew contact. The client payload was therefore not ”safe without services” as required per the NSTS 1700.7B ISS Addendum. In order to protect the crew, the PO added a temperature strip and caution-warning sticker to its payload to serve as the second control of the touch temperature hazard. The MTL was the first control. With the addition of the temperature strip, the client payload now satisfied the NSTS 1700.7B ISS Addendum fault tolerance requirement for a critical hazard. The PO updated its standard payload hazard report to reflect the updated thermal analysis and new second control. In February 2002, the PSRP approved the client payload for flight (STS-111/UF-2). Root Cause: An integrated approach to the analysis, which would have included the potential for failure of critical services from outside the payload, was not thoroughly performed. The client PO did not include loss of services (MTL degradation or failure) in their original thermal analysis. This omission left a potential touch temperature hazard uncontrolled after a single point failure.", "label": [[1183, 1200, "CON"], [1205, 1228, "CON"], [1282, 1306, "MOD"], [1364, 1381, "CON"], [1312, 1315, "CON"], [1844, 1872, "CAU"], [1888, 1920, "CAU"], [1922, 1948, "CAU"], [2017, 2041, "MOD"], [1991, 1999, "CAU"], [296, 321, "MOD"], [338, 384, "CAU"], [514, 549, "CON"], [595, 650, "CAU"], [688, 715, "CON"], [724, 740, "CAU"]], "Lesson ID": 1367}

But system performance can easily be compromised by FPAs and ROICs that are not fully compatible with operational capabilities and performance requirements of the interferometer. The FPAs and ROICs should be designed, fabricated, and tested to meet the spectral, spatial, temporal, radiometric, control, and stability requirements needed to achieve the specified performance of the interferometer. FPA technologies can be overstressed by over-extending the longwave spectral cutoff point. This is especially true of long wave FPAs.

{"id": 16059, "data": "NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, (STMD) formed an STMD-sponsored ''brazing tiger team\" with metallurgical and manufacturing subject matter experts (SMEs) within the Agency to provide technical assistance on various brazing issues for four STMD-funded activities. The SMEs were from MSFC, LaRC, GSFC, GRC, and the NESC Chief Engineer Office. MSFC was assigned the leadership role. The request came at an opportune time for MSFC since MSFC was in the process of working a brazing issue on the Microgravity Materials Science Research Rack Sample Ampoule Cartridge. The goals for this team of brazing SMEs were to provide real time resolution for the specific brazing issues encountered by each of the four activities, evaluate new technology solutions, and enhance our Agency's knowledge of brazing and brazing processes. Four STMD projects were experiencing brazing issues: • Cryocooler/GRC • Water Phase Change Material (pCM) Heat Exchanger (HX)/JSC • Green Propellant Infusion Mission (GPIM)/GRC • Nuclear Systems NaK Heater Head/GRC. During information gathering, JPL engineers presented their lessons learned from the brazing issues resolved on the Deep Space Atomic Clock ion trap tube brazing. JSC proactively offered subject knowledge to the team to assist in developing solutions for the aluminum cold plate dip brazing process. After discussions on the above referenced projects, one onsite visit was made to Mezzo Technologies in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to review the manufacturing processes used for the PCM HX project. Provided here are brief overviews of the primary issues and potential solutions being worked by the respective projects. Additional detail can be provided by the respective project managers. • The Nuclear Systems NaK Heater Head braze assembly consisted of stainless steel tube, Inconel flange, and copper acceptors. These braze joints were failing as a result of unfilled or starved joints due to thermal expansion mismatch and part movement during brazing. o The solution was to redesign the head assembly using common materials to avoid thermal expansion mismatch. o All joints were redesigned to mechanical or welded joints with the exception of one brazed joint. The redesigned one piece inner heater head assembly will eliminate braze joints and will be used as the backup heater head. The Cryocooler heat exchanger braze assembly consisted of stainless steel manifold sheets and thousands of thin-walled microtubes. The braze issues included excessive flow of the braze alloy causing blockage of the microtubes and erosion of the thin walled tubes due to excessive base metal/braze alloy interalloying. Under the Cryocooler Project, Mezzo had not progressed any further with regard to brazing challenges. Mezzo milled the tube sheet boss features with the precision and concentricity necessary to enable successful buildup of a trial recuperator core which was subsequently CNC laser welded by Creare, Inc. of Hanover, New Hampshire. Although this trial laser welded core had some small cross-stream leaks, the number of leaks was less than with any other joining technique attempted. The leaks are expected to be repairable by repeating laser welding. There is one additional trial core to be built before the full scale recuperator is manufactured and performance tested. Work was still ongoing. The PCM HX is making changes to thicker wall tubes to minimize base metal erosion or scarring during the braze process and increase structural stability. The thermal performance of the thicker-walled tubes will be assessed. In addition, Mezzo is investigating different braze alloys, the quantity of braze alloy used, and the braze cycle to control inter-diffusion in order to prevent base metal erosion which weakens the tube walls for the thinner wall tube design. GIPM is developing furnace braze processes for the Iridium/Inconel 625 Injector, an induction braze for the Iridium/Iridium-Rhenium Injector Chamber, and an EB braze for the Copper/Inconel 625 Thermal Shunt Injector Spud. Analysis of brazing issues were not complete at the time this lessons learned was written. The team was satisfied that the procedures for dip brazing used on the aluminum cold plate are adequate. However, because dip braze temperatures are close to the melting point of the aluminum structure, questions remain regarding whether the material properties are negatively affected during the dip brazing process. o Witness specimen tensile testing was recommended to assess strength effects o Hardness – tensile strength curves generated by GSFC were provided for testing o The team recommended that the entire brazing procedure, specifically the amount of time at temperature, should be assessed to identify and mitigate any negative effects of the brazing process on mechanical properties.", "label": [[227, 241, "MOD"], [482, 495, "MOD"], [668, 682, "MOD"], [800, 807, "MOD"], [812, 829, "MOD"], [868, 882, "MOD"], [1132, 1146, "MOD"], [1330, 1345, "MOD"], [1904, 1930, "MOD"], [1938, 1964, "CAU"], [1969, 1997, "CAU"], [1863, 1888, "EFF"], [2021, 2047, "CON"], [2080, 2106, "CAU"], [2126, 2160, "CON"], [2489, 2522, "CAU"], [2602, 2648, "CAU"], [2531, 2557, "MOD"], [2562, 2594, "MOD"], [3034, 3052, "MOD"], [3068, 3073, "MOD"], [3136, 3141, "MOD"], [3175, 3198, "CON"], [3377, 3395, "CON"], [3408, 3426, "MOD"], [3430, 3438, "MOD"], [3730, 3748, "MOD"], [3755, 3777, "EFF"], [3686, 3709, "CON"], [3605, 3627, "CON"], [3633, 3661, "CON"], [3670, 3682, "CON"], [4445, 4477, "REC"], [4497, 4520, "REC"], [4730, 4795, "REC"]], "Lesson ID": 14001}

{"id": 16061, "data": "The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO), an Earth-orbiting satellite mission managed by the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), was designed to make precise, time-dependent, global measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)—a greenhouse gas related to climate change. OCO was a cost-constrained project, and when the OCO spacecraft was lost due to a launch vehicle separation failure, the follow-on OCO-2 project was intended to feature a design identical to OCO with as few changes as possible. The OCO/OCO-2 instrument does not measure CO2 directly, but rather the intensity of the sunlight reflected from the presence of CO2 in a column of air. Three spectrometers each use a diffraction grating (Figure 1) to separate the incoming sunlight into a spectrum of multiple component colors. The need to detect very small variations in intensity over a range of 3048 different colors requires high instrument resolution and precision. As the spacecraft follows a near-polar ground track, Earth observations made by the instrument switch periodically between the Nadir, Glint, and Target modes, with the Glint mode suited to observing solar radiance reflected from the ocean surface. Figure 1. The OCO-2 weak band diffraction grating (above) functions similar to the surface of a compact disk or DVD During the initial on-orbit checkout of OCO-2 following the July 2014 launch, it was discovered that the data produced by Glint mode observations did not match the model (Reference (1)). Further investigation (References (2) and (3)) revealed that the instrument design failed to transmit light polarized parallel to the long axis of the aperture slit, as needed for Glint mode. This results in the anomalous (decreased) radiance levels shown in Figure 2. (This anomaly has a much smaller impact on other observation modes, and it only affects Glint mode observations over the ocean—most strongly at solar zenith angles near 52 degrees (i.e., the Brewster angle for seawater).) Figure 2. This plot of actual Glint mode radiance levels received on-orbit shows that they fail to track to the desired polarization. View larger image This design error was discovered neither in the design process, in the review process, nor by the ground test program. The error originated from a decision, made shortly before the OCO Preliminary Design Review (PDR), when a design change was implemented. Specifically, the original requirement to make the design insensitive to polarization could not be met, so the instrument was redesigned for a single polarization. The implications of this modification were not recognized by the JPL or contractor system engineers. The OCO-2 project repeated the OCO build and test activities without performing a critical review or validation of the OCO requirements and design. Factors contributing to the flight anomaly included: When responsibility for OCO Optics Subsystem assembly and test was transferred to JPL from the contractor in November 2006, the Level 4 (Subsystem) and Level 5 (Assembly) requirements were not transferred. JPL selected some Level 3 (Instrument) requirements to use for Level 4 requirements, but the polarization orientation requirement (L3G.279) was not selected. The comment associated with this decision was, “If we trust vendor data, impossible to miss.” There was a conscious decision that Level 3 test would be sufficient to verify the remaining requirements. (The polarization orientation was also not covered by the Hardware Review & Certification Record (HRCR) process. See Reference (4).) Among the items listed on the Summary of Instrument Changes prepared by the OCO project in March 2003, “polarization” did not appear. Subsequently, the summary of the June 2004 OCO PDR makes no reference to polarization. (Members of the OCO team felt that they were rushed to PDR and had to select only critical design elements for emphasis—that excluded polarization). The OCO-2 project employed a highly tailored formulation period ending with Critical Design Review (CDR). No System Requirements Review (SRR) or PDR was held, implying a high degree of trust in the work done by the OCO project. Near the beginning of integration and test (I&T) for the OCO mission, the project decided to bring the instrument in-house from the contractor. This resulted in a transfer of I&T and verification and validation (V&V) roles to JPL without adequate continuity of involvement by the instrument designers in test design. The system test of the instrument did not include verification of the absolute polarization angle. There was no opportunity to test the instrument at the Observatory System level prior to launch. Despite the polarization anomaly, OCO-2 is able to achieve the volume and quality of science data specified in Level 1 requirements due to the implementation of an operational workaround. Using attitude control to rotate the entire spacecraft closer to the instrument’s polarization response for the Glint mode operations was sufficient to significantly increase the radiance levels. The potential impact of this workaround on solar array orientation/battery charging was mitigated by the spacecraft having healthy instrument technical margins (e.g., battery charge rate). The design of the OCO-3 follow-on instrument to be installed aboard the International Space Station has been modified to address the polarization issue. Also, a test to verify the system’s correct polarization will be conducted prior to the first system-level thermal-vacuum test (Reference (5)).

Water leaks or ruptures can also spill onto sensitive flight hardware or other equipment. This technique will prevent additional repairs if overhead oil or water leaks occur from facility systems. Most importantly, this technique will decrease the electrical hazard potential to maintenance personnel by restricting the entry of water that can cause short circuits. During hoisting operations, oil can drip onto sensitive flight hardware or other equipment. If a drip pan is used, the pan can catch the oil and it can be inspected to monitor the gearbox for oil loss. Significant oil loss can cause damage to the gearbox assembly. To protect against water intrusion, design facilities with drip pans above electronic equipment as shown in Figure 1. Water sources can come from fluid condensation, firex water, or ruptured fluid lines. [D] Use of this technique could have prevented the loss of air conditioning at the KSC Vehicle Assembly Building, Orbiter Processing Facility, and the Launch Control Center when a water line, located above a main power substation, ruptured and shorted the main buses. This mishap interrupted Shuttle processing and cost considerable resources. Hoists contain gearbox assemblies that are filled with oil for lubrication and gear cooling. Gaskets that seal the gearbox housing parts or shaft seals can deteriorate over time and cause oil to leak out. Startup and vibration can cause bolts that connect the gearbox assembly together to become loose and cause oil to leak out. To capture the oil, pans can be constructed from sheet metal. Metal straps are placed on each end of the pan and loop around the front and rear of the gearbox shown in Figure 2. The oil pan should be deep enough to hold all the oil in the gearbox. However, because of space constraints a shallower pan may be used. The pan area should cover the bottom area of the gearbox. [D] For example, Bridge Buckets, located in each of the Orbiter Processing Facilities, are used by personnel to travel along the length of the Orbiter Cargo Bay for inspections. There are gearbox assemblies at various locations such as the hoisting system and the bridge drive assembly. The bucket hoisting system contains a gearbox assembly on each end of the hoist drum. Each gearbox contains a shallow pan with two straps, one on each end, that loop around the front and rear of the gearbox. This prevents any oil that may drip into the Orbiter Cargo Bay. The 250 Ton Bridge Crane, located in the Vehicle Assembly Building, contains an oil drip pan inside the hook load assembly. This prevents oil that could drip onto Solid Rocket Booster Segments or the Orbiter.

{"id": 16066, "data": "During final assembly of the Deep Space 2 (DS2) Mars Microprobes, each of the two flight probes was inadvertently powered. [D] When Mars 98 lander reaches Mars and the DS2 probes are released from the lander cruise ring, a MOSFET electronic switch will apply battery power to each probe. This switch, whose design heritage is unclear, is to be operated only once during the mission. Two mechanical switches are used to provide hold-off bias voltage to prevent the electronic switch from turning on until the probes are released. Both mechanical switches must be activated to power the probes, which then remain powered unless all system power is lost. Although a safing plug keeps the electronic switch biased to the off condition during early phases of assembly, the design required its removal well before the completion of electrical assembly. The overall system implementation included the following deficiencies and vulnerabilities that were not well understood and were not adequately accounted for in the system design, the Failure Modes and Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA), and assembly planning: The electronic switch design permitted the probes to be powered if any of the wires connected to the mechanical switches were even partially connected to ground. An estimated resistance to ground of 1.5 megohm or less is sufficient to turn on the switch. The anomaly investigation determined that even the body resistance of the assemblers connecting the wires was sufficient to cause this very sensitive electronic switch to turn on. The design of the mechanical switches allowed an unintentional ground path to the probe aeroshell. This would inadvertently power the probes during assembly, causing loss of the DS2 mission due to an undetected battery depletion prior to launch. The design did not permit the safing plug to remain installed throughout electrical assembly. The electronic switch circuit design required external power while the batteries were being connected. Following completion of the anomaly investigation, design changes were made to electrically isolate the mechanical switches and retain the safing plug in place during electrical installation of these switches. Procedures were changed to require extreme care to avoid stray resistances due to handling following removal of the safing plug.

One of the possible proximate causes investigated was that NCG-supported vapor bubbles might have blocked the flow regulators that are present at the end of each of the five parallel LHP condenser legs. Since anomalous performance was seen in ground tests of the GOES-17 LHPs, the physics of bubbles in the slow moving liquid (on the order of 1.5 m/s or 5 ft/min) was investigated. It was determined that when the radiator was tested on edge and some flow paths were vertical: Counterflow would exist in the vertical condenser passages, meaning that bubbles would not be transported through the serpentine condenser flow passage to the flow regulators. It was determined that when the radiator was tested horizontally and all flow paths were horizontal: Even large vapor bubbles would not fill the tube completely – leaving a liquid flow path underneath. This plus the fact that the flow regulator was located below the condenser tube eliminated the possibility of bubble transport to the flow regulator. In 0-g, large bubbles would fill the condenser tube and would be transported to the flow regulator with the liquid flow. The difference in behavior means that the effect of large NCG-supported vapor bubbles would be very different in 0-g and in 1-g.", "label": [[298, 350, "CAU"], [702, 760, "CAU"], [4, 61, "MOD"], [1051, 1067, "CAU"], [984, 1038, "CAU"]], "Lesson ID": 26703}

When Columbia returned to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), following the mission, troubleshooting revealed that the outer airlock hatch actuator assembly was faulty. A new actuator assembly was installed on Columbia and the outer airlock hatch opened and closed normally. Troubleshooting on the bench revealed that one of the two Number 4-40 fasteners that hold the no-back/clutch assembly together had backed out and was lodged between a planetary gear and the ring gear within the actuator gearbox. Furthermore, the second fastener was partially backed out and was loose (no running torque). It was also found that the threaded inserts used with the fasteners were a non-locking type when the drawing specified that a locking threaded insert should be used. Additionally, the vendor drawing did not specify a torque value for these fasteners. To resolve this issue, all actuators in the fleet were reworked to install locking threaded inserts.

First, the Project had difficulty recognizing the incoming PM as an authority over the PI, who in this case was a well-known and respected scientist that germinated the Project concept.

{"id": 16077, "data": "A feedthrough condition occurs after most JPL spacecraft launches during initial acquisition of the downlink signal. The station's downlink signal performance indicators are affected by feedthrough from the uplink to the downlink. This feedthrough source may be uplink transmitter noise or, if there is ranging modulation, it may be components of the uplink ranging channel. In current link designs, the condition does not noticeably degrade the telemetry or ranging signals processed from the downlink for delivery to the project. Feedthrough occurs because of the extremely strong uplink signal over a distance of just a few thousand kilometers; this has the effect of reducing the station's reported value of downlink carrier power or of telemetry signal-to-noise ratio. Saturation effects in the station's receiver software algorithms contribute to the indications of signal degradation. This saturation causes the indicated signal-to-noise ratio to top out at a particular value even when the expected level may be tens of dB higher. One variation on this problem was experienced by both Mars Exploration Rover (MER-A) and Mars Odyssey. The initial acquisition downlinks from both missions experienced post-launch downlink saturation effects that produced lower-than-predicted downlink levels. In this case, uplink ranging data power harmonics feedthrough caused a \"pedestal effect,\" effectively raising the noise floor in the station receiver and degrading a key estimator (Symbol Signal-to-Noise Ratio). A related problem was documented in a lesson learned written on the Voyager mission. Voyager experienced command feedthrough problems because the uplink command modulation index (carrier suppression) that was optimal for commanding tended to degrade X-band telemetry. Link accommodations were successfully implemented by the Voyager mission. The problem described in Reference (1) has since been \"designed out\" with the 16 kHz command subcarrier frequency used by modern transponders in place of the Voyager-era 512 Hz. None of these strong-signal receiver nonlinearities affect the ability of telemetry subsystems to support ongoing activities. However, the apparent downlink signal degradation tends to elicit consternation in a critical phase of the mission if these expected effects have not been thoroughly coordinated between the Flight Project and the Deep Space Network, or if the Flight Control Team (FCT) has not yet become fully familiar with this idiosyncrasy of the mission operations system.

{"id": 16079, "data": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1221; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: Selection of the optimum battery for space flight applications results in a safe, effective, efficient, and economical power storage capability. The optimum battery also enhances launch operations, minimizes impacts to resources, supports contingency operations, and meets demand loads. Implementation Method: Primary batteries, those which are not recharged are and useful for short duration, are used principally for providing electrical power for launch vehicles. These batteries must have high energy density, high current capabilities, and good reliability. MSFC has had experience with Lithium/Monoflouride (Li/CF), Lithium/Thionyl Chloride (Li/SOCl2), and Silver/Zinc (Ag/Zn) primary batteries. Secondary batteries, those which are discharged and then recharged numerous times, are principally used for spacecraft, satellite, and other long-term space-oriented applications. In space applications, reliability, costs, producibility, responsiveness, risks, safety, and maintainability are more important than high current content. MSFC has had experience with Silver/Zinc (Ag/Zn), Nickel/Hydrogen (Ni/H2), Nickel/Cadmium (Ni/Cd), Nickel/Metal Hydride (Ni/MH), and Bi Polar-Lead Acid (Bi-Pb/Acid). [D] Battery types are selected for specific applications based on a number of factors including specific energy and energy density (see Figures 1 and 2), lifetime, number of cycles, discharge rate, charge retention, shelf life, ruggedness, operating temperature, and other factors. Figure 3 presents these factors for various battery types. Figure 3 should be used by the designer as an initial tool for selecting the required battery type. The design of batteries for space flight should be accompanied by battery level electrical, mechanical and thermal analysis. [D] A typical battery selection flow chart is shown on Figure 4. After the program is identified and electrical power requirements are established, a trade study should be performed to determine the actual battery (primary or secondary) that will fulfill the requirements at a reasonable cost. Cell selection includes charge voltage, discharge capacity, and discharge voltage after cycling. Establishing the battery size is determined by the number of cells required to provide the required electrical power, i.e., a 24-volt battery using a 1.5 volt cell will require 16 cells. Mechanical packaging of the cells into a battery requires such parameters as cell type, number of cells, weight, length, height, temperature requirements, mounting method, vibration environment, electrical feed through, and venting requirements to ensure proper functioning of the battery. Perhaps the most important part of selecting a battery is the selection of a reliable cell/battery manufacturer. Preferably one that has consistently produced high quality and reliable batteries. Manufacturing engineers should critique the design for producibility and testability early in the design process and make corrective suggestions when problems are discovered. [D] Accelerated life testing of batteries is extremely difficult due to the nature of the chemical reaction between the electrolyte and the positive and negative electrodes. Therefore, preferred type and configuration of the battery should be selected early in the program to allow for lifetime testing. Performance testing of the selected battery can be accomplished in parallel with life testing. Performance testing should be accomplished in an environment to which the battery is expected to be exposed during operation. The battery should demonstrate during testing that it will deliver the required electrical power and will charge and discharge as designed. Technical Rationale: MSFC's aerospace flight battery experience comes from a combination of its own in-house laboratory experience on numerous programs; from coordination with battery manufacturers, prime contractors, and subcontractors for a number of launch vehicles, space vehicles, and experiments; and from many years of participation in NASA/industry aerospace battery workshops. Two such workshops, hosted by the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, were attended by approximately 200 persons each, representing both Government and industry. Credit must be given to the interdisciplinary efforts of Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA Headquarters, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, Kennedy Space Center, Ames Research Center, Langley Research Center, Lewis Research Center, and their suppliers and contractors, as well as to many academic and nonprofit organizations who have contributed to the battery research leading to this body of knowledge.

{"id": 16090, "data": "In a scenario that is most likely to occur on severely time-constrained flight projects, testing is interrupted and test time is lost because of unreported changes to the testbed configuration. During subsystem integration and test (I&T) of Mars Exploration Rover (MER), for example, a software test operator spent two hours at a keyboard preparing for a special MER flight software (FSW) test case. When the test began, the system crashed, and extensive troubleshooting disclosed that the test operator had been unaware that the previous shift had removed the Rover camera from the testbed. Other similar incidents might stem from a loose cable caused by an equipment swap. This problem is exacerbated for projects like MER where system development continues even while testing is underway in dual work shifts. JPL flight system I&T programs typically implement the following steps to minimize lost test time: A meeting is held at the beginning of each I&T shift to brief the incoming team on changes to the testbed configuration. A startup procedure, maintained for each testbed, is continually updated to reflect the current testbed configuration. An on-line reporting tool is used to capture the activities of each test shift, document hand-over instructions to the next shift, report changes to the testbed configuration, and provide links to problem/failure reports generated during the shift. A spreadsheet reports the status of connectors and cables that have been mated or demated. A walkthrough of the testbed configuration prior to each work shift would likely have prevented the MER test errors. They were not feasible for MER, though, because there were several hundred connectors in each testbed, and not all of them were visible to the operator.

{"id": 16092, "data": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Guideline Number GD-ED-2203 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: Use of this guideline will ensure continued improvement with the use of microcircuits in circuit designs by incorporating data from previously experienced problems into a design checklist. This will apply the experience base from the past and thus provide improved reliability for future space programs. Technical Rationale: Information gathered from a history base of known problem areas is presented in easy-to-use checklist form to be used by designers, etc. The checklists are separated into three categories, based on device technology (TTL, CMOS and memory). The guideline can then be used as a reference to avoid incorrect utilization of these component types in circuit design applications which may result in potentially poor reliability. TTL DESIGN CHECKLIST 1 Only gates from the same package should be connected in parallel. 2 Take note not to exceed fan-out limit (maximum number of circuits fed input signals from a single output terminal). 3 Check pin compatibility when using devices from different families or manufacturers. 4 Check manufacturer interchangeability for minor functional differences. 5 Maintain equal loading in ac and dc terms on multiple output devices with internal feedback. 6 The dynamic threshold of low-power schottky (LS) gates varies between 1.1 V and 1.4 V depending on circuit configuration; therefore, slow rise times (greater than 50 nanoseconds) will possibly cause pattern sensitivity. 7 Gates with outputs driving transmission lines should be situated close to the board periphery. 8 Consider full-range temperature effects on switching characteristics relative to design application. 9 Use pull-up resistors on devices with open collector gates. 10 Consider the frequency dependency of power dissipation when the operating frequency is greater than 1 to 2 MHz. 11 If decoded outputs from counters, particularly from ripple counters, are being used as clocks to drive counters or memory devices, the decoded outputs of interest should be examined for multiple pulses at counter transitions that might ambiguously operate the driven counters or memory devices, and corrective measures should be taken to non-ambiguously operate the driven circuits. 12 Take note that low-power, low-power Schottky, and Schottky TTL circuits are known to fail when exposed to 5 microjoules or more of electrostatic discharge (ESD) energy. 13 Consider \"current dumping\" effects when a multiple input gate is terminated to a single high impedance source such as a 150-ohm line. 14 All unused input pins should be tied to high- or low-logic levels, depending on the circuit application. When devices approaching their maximum speed for TTL are used, unused inputs should be \"commoned\" to used inputs rather than tied high; whereas for low-power Schottky devices with diode inputs, the unused ones can be directly connected to VCC. 15 Provide isolation for test points so that any foreseeable occurrence, such as shorting between, grounding or external excitation at the test points will not disrupt operational use of the circuit being monitored by the test points. 16 Consider potential problems involving the use of multiple flip-flops controlled by one or more asynchronous output. 17 Check interfacing parameters (fan-out, loading, and threshold) when using devices from different families. CMOS DESIGN CHECKLIST 1 Allow for hold-time and setup-time requirements of CMOS flip-flops, registers, and latches. Inputs to CMOS devices must be stable before and remain stable even after the active clock pulse edge. 2 Take adequate precautions to avoid ESD damage. 3 Account for possible incompatibilities with similar part numbers from different manufacturers when establishing parts lists. 4 Investigate the package choice/reliability tradeoff for each design application. 5 When using single-stage (unbuffered) multiple-input CMOS devices, consider that both dynamic and static performance of these circuits can deteriorate under certain logic conditions to the extent that logic systems display pattern sensitivity. 6 Protect signal inputs against overvoltage spikes and input currents exceeding ratings, i.e. many CMOS devices have ten milliamperes as the maximum allowable input current. Consider that if the overvoltage spike is greater than the supply voltage, the parasitic PNP or NPN transistors become forward biased and latch-up can occur. 7 Excessive current through switches results in latching and destructive breakdown; therefore, protective circuitry is essential. 8 Consider the noise margin when using 5-volt supply levels. CMOS has an order of magnitude less energy noise margin than TTL (approximately 0.4 nanojoules for CMOS and 4.0 nanojoules for standard TTL). 9 The power supply should switch on by itself first before signal inputs are applied, since damage may occur if the diode between input and VDD is forward biased. 10 Slowly rising or falling input signals can lead to multiple triggering, particularly if the supply voltage is poorly regulated, and also to higher supply (IDD) currents. 11 Maximum power dissipation of the device could be exceeded if input rise and fall times are greater than 15 microseconds, (depending on device type) especially using high current drivers with high supply voltages. 12 Terminate all unused inputs; a floating input can turn a CMOS device on, causing faulty operation and possible damage, and also uses increased power since both p- and n-transistors are partially conducting. 13 Ensure that interfacing parameters between CMOS and other logic families are correct, particularly with regard to loading and thresholds. 14 Keep interconnections short or use terminations, as long interconnections in high speed systems behave like transmission lines, which can cause reflections and ringing. 15 Do not use CMOS gates as linear amplifiers; this can destroy buffer gates, cause failure of the device to operate below 4 volts, and make supplier interchangeability even more problematical. 16 Avoid long, closely spaced, parallel traces on PCB's to minimize crosstalk. 17 Flip-flops with transmission gate inputs are particularly prone to malfunction if the inputs are driven above and below the supply voltages. This can occur when interfacing from other logic families and from distant boards. 18 Try not to design to typical values because of the large part-to-part process variations. In many cases guaranteed values are several orders of magnitude larger than typical values. 19 Reduce ground/power supply inductance (power/ground planes) and use sufficient decoupling capacitors, as simultaneous switching of multiple outputs causes noise and voltage drops on power supplies. MEMORY DESIGN CHECKLIST 1 Avoid using parts at their maximum supply voltage tolerance and/or at their maximum speed. In a large memory system, noise, loading, and skew problems result in reduced apparent working area and reduced effective speed. 2 Consider carefully the difficulty in \"second sourcing\" with memory components, since they are far more complex than standard medium scale integration components (MSI); and very few, if any, have identical replacements. 3 Avoid mixing several technologies within the same memory system. If this is done great care must be taken to ensure that at no time are the pins of any memory component pulled beyond the component's substrate voltage. 4 When read-only memories (ROM's) are used to replace wired logic gates, the outputs may show noise or extra transitions, since the ROM is not guaranteed to give a single output transition for a single input transition. 5 In the use of nichrome fused bipolar programmable read-only memories (PROM's) there has been evidence of fuses growing back after programming and of unblown fuses being subject to decay. Ensure that special freezeout tests and high voltage stressing have been carried out, and also consider the greatly delayed production cycles involved. 6 Take note when using PROM's that the programming operation on devices from the same family are not necessarily compatible. Examples are the 1602 and 1702 devices in which the programming operation forces \"ones\" to \"zeros,\" and the 1602A and 1702A devices which force \"zeros\" to \"ones.\" 7 Caution must be taken when using common bus lines not to allow more than one device to be enabled at a time. System noise and incorrect data problems could result, and depending on output drive capability, physical damage to the device could occur. 8 In order to minimize transmission line problems, the driver elements should be located as closely as possible to the memory elements, keeping the connecting printed circuit lines as short as possible. 9 Asynchronous input signals applied to a ROM should be permitted to change within an access time sufficient to meet setup and hold times, prior to clocking the output register. If this does not occur the contents of the output register may be completely unpredictable. 10 Periodically check PROM programming electrical specifications, since manufacturers often change their recommended programming method to improve programming yields. 11 Ensure the correct programming conditions (voltage, duration, etc.) when programming PROM's. 12 Ensure that shift register drivers have sufficient dumping capabilities, otherwise positive or negative spikes may be coupled from one clock to the opposite phase. Spikes may reach over the substrate voltage and activate parasitic substrated transistors and destroy data. 13 Memory products usually dissipate power at significantly higher levels per package than most large-scale integration (LSI) and MSI components. It is therefore very important that adequate cooling arrangements be made, because the power dissipation per unit area can approach an order of magnitude greater than ordinary TTL. 14 Allow in the design for the ROM/PROM access time differences from various parts of the array. Differences of four to one have been found for various address locations. 15 Take caution when using dynamic MOS shift registers (SR's) as low-speed power-saving circuits, since data can be lost if the SR clock speed is reduced instantaneously. The lower frequency limit applies only at high ambient temperatures and not at self-heated high-junction temperatures produced at high clock frequencies. 16 Take note that when using floating gate metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) PROM's, bit loss occurs under x-ray and nuclear radiation. In addition, problems of inadequate erasure due to poorly calibrated ultraviolet sources can arise. 17 Take caution when using MOS electrically alterable PROM's, since data loss can occur from cells subjected to greater than 109 accesses. Given an access time of 1 microsecond, the data could be lost within an hour if continuous reads are made from one location. 18 Power supply slew characteristics should be evaluated carefully. Two separate problems have been noted. One problem is that at switch-on, a slowly rising power supply may not initialize the random access memory (RAM) logic correctly so that a subsequent initializing procedure is required. Another problem is that sharp, small supply voltage changes that occur in normal memory system operation can cause data loss in some supplier dynamic memory products. 19 Operating temperatures have to be considered very carefully. Because of their complexity, memory components tend to be more sensitive to temperature extremes than other types of devices. 20 Consider that large MOS memory systems often require error correction and detection (the inclusion of \"Hamming\" error correction codes in the design). This approach improves the effective system reliability by two orders of magnitude, and the associated error indicators simplify scheduled maintenance. 21 Consider access time measurement criteria carefully. While some manufacturers measure access times to the VOL and VOH voltage levels, others measure access to the 1.5 voltage level for both high- and low-level outputs. Additionally, some suppliers specify two output loads in their dc characteristics, but measure access time against one output load. 22 Many dynamic RAM's require a substrate bias supply (VBB) to ensure correct operation. Unless this bias supply is raised before the main supply and dropped after the main supply, high currents may be drawn. Also, if the bias supply is reversed even in a transient mode, the parasitic substrate transistor will draw extremely high currents. Since the internal capacitances of the RAM are terminated to the substrate, very good transient bypassing is required. 23 Take care when using bipolar memory devices (e.g., many ROM/PROM devices) with PNP transistor low-power Schottky style inputs. It is important that the inputs not be pulled below ground until the PNP device is saturated; otherwise, very long access times will be observed. 24 Allow for input/output coupling features of static RAM's in the system design. Although possibly not shown on the write-cycle data published by the manufacturers, the input data may appear on the output during the write mode.

Implementation Method: Electrostatic controls are implemented at KSC to reduce the effects of ESD during the following operations: General STS and Payload Operations - The percent relative humidity in an operational area is recorded every four hours prior to the start and during operations involving exposed solid propellants, open flammable/combustible fluid systems and category A Electro-explosive Devices (EED) when the Faraday (electrically conductive shield) cap is removed or firing circuits to EEDs are exposed. At or below 50% RH, bonding and grounding measures are verified. In addition, non-conductive materials in the area and personnel not wearing personnel grounding devices are checked with an electrostatic meter to ensure voltages greater than 350 volts are not present. Electrostatic scanning, not exceeding one hour intervals, is performed during the operation when at any time: additional personnel, equipment or hardware are introduced into the immediate area, the RH decreases, or the handling of non-conductive materials is required. At or below 30% RH, operations involving exposed solid propellant, except Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) segments, or open flammable/combustible fluid system and category A EEDs (with Faraday caps removed or firing circuits exposed) are not permitted. In the Orbiter Processing facility (OPF), the RH is controlled to within 40 - 50% thus minimizing the effects of ESD. STS SRB Processing - Segment processing may continue below 50% RH using the following guidelines, segment processing is not permitted at or below 10%: Between 50% and 30% RH the above requirements apply. With proper approval, operations may continue at RH levels below 30% down to 10%. In addition to the above requirement, electronic scanning is required to to be accomplished at 10 minute intervals if the propellant is exposed, and at 30 minute intervals if the propellant is covered. At no time will operations continue on the segments with propellant exposed and a potential of 350 volts or greater is measured on the segment case, propellant, or any equipment/personnel within five feet of exposed propellant. When the segment and rings with shipping covers are installed (propellant protected by a Faraday cage), the following guidelines apply: A reading of one kilovolt or less on the case is acceptable and work may continue. A reading of greater than one kilovolt, but less than four kilovolts on the case requires all segment processing to cease and personnel will stand back four feet. An electrostatic scan will be repeated every five minutes and recorded. If the reading of one kilovolt or up to four kilovolts exists for 30 minutes, connection to facility ground will be verified. If this connection is open, then the ground will be reconnected thru a resistor (1 Meg ohm +/-20%). Processing may continue when the electrostatic scan indicates less than one kilovolt. An electrostatic reading of four kilovolts or greater requires all work to stop. All personnel will evacuate to a location 500 feet from the processing area. Designated personnel may re-enter for electrostatic scan. This scan is repeated not less than every 15 minutes. No attempt to check grounds will be performed. If, after an hour, readings still exceed four kilovolts, then a separate ground with a resistor (1 Meg ohm +/- 20%) in line may be connected to another ground point on the segment case. Work may resume when a reading of one kilovolt or less is obtained and all grounds have been rechecked. Launch Processing System (LPS) Operations - LPS operators coming in contact with the LPS hardware subsystems are required to wear approved grounding wrist straps during test and launch processing operations in environmental conditions below 45% relative humidity. LPS system, maintenance, or support personnel coming in contact with low voltage LPS hardware Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) / Components are required to wear approved grounding wrist straps at all times. LPS / Checkout, Control and Monitor Subsystem (CCMS) console stations are equipped with approved terminated ground cables containing quick connect / disconnect type wrist strap snaps. Systems, maintenance or support personnel will connect the grounding lead clip to a conductive surface on the LPS grounded hardware structure. Testing stations are available for proper go/no go testing of the approved grounding cable and wrist straps. Logistics - The effects of ESD on static sensitive Line Replaceable Units (LRU's) during transportation and storage is alleviated with the use of transparent electrostatic-shielding bags. This packaging scheme affords static protection against both external static fields and internal triboelectric charge. All programmable read-only memories (PROM's) are transported and stored in static-shielding tubes or approved foam and shielding bags for distribution to installation in LPS hardware sets. These tubes protect against triboelectric charging and direct discharge yielding a dynamic response rating of less than 1 millisecond. All integrated circuits (IC's) for temporary staging are placed (leads inserted) on crosslink, noncorrosive, high density, conductive foam. This foam ensures that all device leads are kept at the same potential, thereby protecting the device from ESD damage. Other - inspection, testing and repairs of static sensitive electronic components or LRU'sare performed at approved ESD work stations. These work stations, designed to bleed off static charges, utilizes static dissipative table mats electrically connected to a static dissipative floor mat which is connected to ground thru a series resistor (1 Meg ohm +/-20%). The operator connects a wrist strap, to a single point ground, to make himself equal to the same potential as the components that are on the table, thus, prohibiting static discharge on conductive components. Technical Rationale:Fundamentals of Electrostatics - To insure successful implementation of proper guarding against harmful effects of ESD, familiarity with the concepts of electrostatics and ESD is necessary. Here, the basic elements are briefly discussed. For more extensive discussion, refer to books listed in the references. The main basic elements of ESD are&colon. electric charges, electric field, electrostatic potential, capacitance, charge generation and charge removal. Electric Charges - Experiments have shown that when two dissimilar objects are brought into contact with each other and then separated, the two objects become charged. The classic example is the rubbing of a silk cloth on a glass rod where the charge is visually evident when the charged objects cause the hair on your arm to stand up or cause small bits of paper to be attracted to the charged objects. If two corks are charged by the glass rod, the corks will repel each other because of like charges. Conversely, if one cork is charged by the glass rod and the other is charged by the silk (opposite charges), the corks will attract each other. The charge on these objects is due to an excess or deficiency of electrons on their surfaces. These charges are referred to as static electricity. This is because they can remain stationary on an object for substantial long periods of time. It is to be noted that this sudden transfer of charge from one body to another (by oppositely charged bodies being brought into close proximity) is called electrostatic discharge or the better known acronym \"ESD\". Lightning is a very high energy form of ESD. The interactions between electric charges are described by Coulomb's law: F=kq1q2/r. Where F is the magnitude of the force, k is the proportionally constant, q1 & q2are the charges on the object and r is the distance between them. Electric Field - describes the influence of an isolated charge on other charges in its vicinity. This electric field is the direction and magnitude of the force exerted by the charge on a unit charge at any point in its environment. The field strength (E) of an object is force(F)/charge(q). A good example of electrostatic field is when a person generates a charge on a balloon and then holds it above his head to make his hair stand up. The balloon never touches the hair, but an electrostatic field has been created. Electrostatic Potential - the amount of energy (work) per unit charge required to move a charge from one point to another in a field. The movement of the charge (q) along a distance (X) requires work (W). Thus the equation W=FX and, substituting the forementioned, W=qEX or W/q=EX . This work per unit charge is the potential difference expressed in volts. Thus the formula E=V/d, where E is the electric field intensity, V is the electric potential and d is the distance between the potential voltages. Ideally, we want to make sure that all charges remain at the same level or same potential so that no ESD (zap) occurs. Capacitance - the ratio between the charge on two plates and the potential difference between them, or, C= Q/V. In the case of two parallel plates this capacitance C=eA/d where A is the area of the plates and d is the distance between the plates (potential voltages) and, e is the dielectric constant. Where typical capacitance (C) values for humans ranges from 50 to 500 picofarads (pf) and dielectric constants of 1 (air and insulators) to 10 (insulators). The energy stored in a capacitor is given by the expression E= 1/2CV2 or 1/2Q2/C. Charge Generation - charging that occurs as a result of contact and frictional motion is referred to as triboelectricity. To describe, whenever two materials (one must be an insulator) are brought together and then separated, there will be a flow of electrons from one material to the other. The material giving up the electrons becomes positively charged while the material accepting the electrons becomes negatively charged. Charge Removal - dissipation of electrostatic potential with the use of soft grounding, static dissipative materials and air ionizers. Listed below are some of the more common materials and their polarity (+ or -) in the triboelectric series. Asbestos Acquires a more positive charge Glass Human Hair Nylon Wool Aluminum Paper Polyurethane Cotton Neutral reference point Wood Steel Sealing Wax Hard Rubber Mylar Epoxy Glass Nickel, Copper, Silver Brass, Stainless Steel Acrylic Polystyrene Foam Polyurethane Foam Polyester Polyethylene Polypropylene PVC (vinyl)Teflon Silicone Rubber Acquires a more negative charge When the charged object is an insulator, the charge can last for extended periods of time. This is true because insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Conversely, when the charged object is a conductor, the charge will decay rather quickly. The factors affecting the magnitude of the rate of charge generation are: Relative position in the triboelectric series. Intimacy of contact (proximity of the materials). Coefficient of friction between materials. Rate of separation. The factors affecting the magnitude of a rate of discharge (dissipation) are: Conductivity of the materials. Relative humidity. Moisture on the surfaces of the materials. Rate of recombination. Some typical electrostatic potential (volts) generated for typical events with various levels of relative humidity (RH) are respectively: Walking across a carpet 35,000 volts @ 10% RH 15,000 volts @ 40% RH 7,500 volts @ 50% RH Walking across a vinyl floor 12,000 volts @ 10% RH 5,000 volts @ 40% RH 3,000 volts @ 50% RH Pulling tape quickly from its roll 10,000 volts @ 30% RH ESD is not normally a concern when the relative humidity is greater than 50% RH because moisture in the air will act as a high resistance bleeder. This will then dissipate voltage potentials on the surface before they can build up to a level of approximately 350 volts and result in ESD. A few materials such as teflon, vinyl, etc. do not absorb moisture and therefore, will not bleed off readily even in environments above 50% RH and should be avoided where ESD is a concern. Environments below 50% RH require special attention for selection of and use of tapes, plastic films and electrostatic flooring material. Operations below 30% RH should be carefully assessed and avoided when possible. At levels below 30% RH, additional precautions shall be employed (e.g., air ionizers, humidifiers). Voltages, especially on large surfaces, should be dissipated using a high resistance resistor (1 Meg ohm +/- 20%) in series with the ground wire until the charge is eliminated before going directly to ground. Note: Surface resistivity changes exponentially with humidity changes. Therefore, relative humidity levels maintained between 40% and 60% are recommended.

There were no injuries to the pilot, co-pilot, or the observer in the course of this event. The Learjet was used on an infrequent basis as a research testbed. The aircraft had just returned to flight status from an extended period in flyable storage. This type of usage did not permit the assigned aircrew to maintain currency. The flight was a scheduled recurrency flight. There was inadequate guidance in the areas of piloting duties, crew pairing, recurrency requirements, and restrictions to carrying passengers. The daily flight supervision process was inadequate to mitigate the lack of DOP-0-300 guidance. The supervisory process did not provide adequate policy, procedures, nor oversight and insight for aircrew conducting flights to ensure significant qualifications, training and currency were met. The direct causes of this mishap were identified as: Over control of the aircraft by the copilot (pilot flying) leading to an aggravated roll oscillation, hard landing, loss of control, and subsequent impact. A significant factor was the copilot's limited total piloting experience, particularly in high performance jet aircraft and in the Learjet. Failure of the pilot in command (pilot not flying) to recognize the deteriorating situation in time to recover the aircraft.

{"id": 16100, "data": "The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) was declared a loss only a few days after launch. A NASA review board (reference 1) determined that the telescope aperture cover was unintentionally ejected prior to spacecraft attitude stabilization when the WIRE pyro electronics box was first powered. Without the thermal protection provided by the cover, the solid hydrogen cryogen essential for operation of the telescope rapidly sublimated and vented. The mission loss is attributed to a pyro electronics box design that did not allow for the known transient performance of components. The control logic design utilized a synchronous reset to force the logic into a safe state. However, the start-up time of the crystal clock oscillator was not taken into consideration, leaving the circuit in a non-deterministic state for a time sufficient for pyrotechnic actuation. Likewise, the startup characteristics of the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) were not considered. The FPGAs were not guaranteed to follow their quottruth tablequot until quotstartedquot by an internal charge pump. The electrical transients initially generated by the FPGAs were not blocked from the driver circuitry of the pyros. Prompted by the failure investigation, circuit analysis and test showed that the turn-on transients are sufficient to produce spurious signals that latch-up the control logic to a state that can issue commands to fire cover release pyros. These anomalous characteristics were not detected during subsystem or system functional testing due to the limited fidelity and detection capabilities of the electrical ground support equipment. There was no system-level end-to-end test in an as-flown configuration. [D] WIRE Pyro Electronics Startup Characteristics The design error was exacerbated by the failure of a detailed technical review to penetrate the electronic design of the pyro electronics box.

{"id": 16101, "data": "An onsite maintenance and operations contractor was tasked to erect scaffolding inside of a wind tunnel test section so that a heavy gas door seal could be replaced. The test section floor is level until it opens into the tunnel where the floor slopes downward. The portion of tunnel that slopes down from the test section is called the contraction wall. One end of the scaffold had to be placed on the down slope. In order to secure the scaffold, three pads were welded onto the test section floor which had a pivoting vertical tube attached to it. The vertical scaffold legs were slid into the tubes. Safety straps were attached to the test section floor because an outrigger section, which extended out over the contraction wall, was installed on the main scaffold. After the completion of work, the onsite maintenance and operations contractor began to take down the scaffold. Four workers were tasked to disassemble the scaffold. Due to the uniqueness of the scaffolding arrangement, the workers were told to wait for their supervisor to coordinate the effort. The workers took it upon themselves to disassemble the scaffold. During the disassembly, with the outrigger section still in place, the safety straps were removed. Two employees were on the scaffold when the straps were removed. As they continued to disassemble the scaffolding, the center of gravity shifted over the outrigger. This caused the scaffolding to topple over since the straps had been removed. Both employees rode the scaffolding to the bottom of the contraction wall. One employee sustained no injuries. The second employee told his co-workers to call 911. He was taken to a local hospital and released with minor injuries. All employees involved had received training on the assembling and disassembling of scaffolding. The crew lead was one of the employees working on the scaffolding. Under normal conditions, the crew lead would supervise the work, but the crew supervisor told the crew lead to not begin disassembly until he was present to supervise the work. The crew lead ignored this request and began disassembly. Because the crew lead was actively involved in the take down, he did not see his error in removing the straps.

{"id": 16103, "data": "After its September 2007 launch, the Dawn spacecraft employed a solar-powered ion propulsion system (IPS) to gain the additional velocity needed to reach Vesta and Ceres, and it will use the IPS to spiral to a low altitude orbit around these asteroids. Compared to chemical rockets, ion engines make very efficient use of onboard fuel because the propulsive energy is derived from the sun. Solar electric propulsion (SEP) technology for navigation beyond Earth orbit was successfully demonstrated from 1998 to 2001 by the Deep Space 1 (DS1) mission, and Dawn planned to use the same IPS design (Figures 1 and 2). .................... Figure 1. Deep Space 1 is lifted from its work platform at NASA Kennedy Space Center, providing a close view of the IPS Figure 2. Hot fire test of the Deep Space 1 IPS The development of the Dawn IPS by the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) proved much more difficult and expensive than expected. The principal unanticipated problem was a degraded ability to manufacture the DS1-legacy components, principally the ion thrusters and the Power Processor Units (PPUs) (References (1) and (2)). The inherited DS1 components had evolved through informal engineering processes more typical of experiments than development of configuration-controlled flight hardware. Although the Dawn IPS contractor for the ion thrusters and PPUs was the same company that had built the DS1 hardware, and the Dawn thrusters and PPUs were proposed as build-to-print copies of the DS1 designs, the contractor encountered significant management and process problems in delivering the Dawn flight hardware. The contractor problems, which likely were exacerbated by the 6-year lag between these two projects, included: JPL efforts to negotiate a fixed-price or incentive-based contract with the Dawn IPS contractor failed. The resultant cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was overrun by almost 100 percent, and the flight hardware was delivered 8 months late. The Dawn IPS contractor for the ion thrusters believed it could reproduce the assembly processes for the DS1 thrusters, but major cost escalation during fabrication, assembly, and testing of the Dawn IPS revealed that the time lag between the two projects had degraded their capabilities. Also, the vendor that fabricated the DS1 ion thruster plasma screen was no longer in business, and the vendor that performed chem-etching of the DS1 thruster grids did not bid on the Dawn thruster grids. No shock testing of the DS1 thruster had been performed except at the less critical spacecraft level. The DS1 PPU assembly procedures and other information needed to reproduce the hardware had not been adequately documented or retained. Over the 2-1/2 years of the Dawn IPS build, the IPS contractor for the ion thrusters and PPUs cycled through four general managers and four Electric Propulsion department managers. Each upper-level manager in the contractor's corporate unit was fully aware of a pending sale of the unit by the parent company. These managers were motivated to please their parent company's customers, and there were frequent delays due to reassignment of Dawn resources to these other projects. A total of 40 IPS component and subsystem design reviews, plus the hardware reviews, produced a huge number of action items-- 630. The number would have been more manageable had the required documents-- technical requirements documents (TRDs), interface control drawings (ICDs), mechanical interface control drawings (MICDs)-- been completed on time. The Dawn IPS interface with the spacecraft was complex. Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations (ATLO, aka spacecraft Integration & Test) was delayed pending receipt and installation of the thermal hardware because responsibility for thermal hardware (e.g., heaters, blankets, and platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs)) attached to the IPS components was divided between JPL and the Dawn spacecraft system contractor. Two test-as-you-fly exceptions went undetected prior to launch and were only identified because of problems encountered during the initial spacecraft checkout activities. The latch valve masking should have been installed for the second phase of spacecraft thermal-vacuum testing, and a gimbal problem was not identified due to insufficient testing of the gimbals with the spacecraft prior to launch. These management problems affecting the Dawn IPS development were accompanied by many IPS design implementation, fabrication, and test technical problems with the ion thrusters, grids, cathode magnets, PPUs, digital control and interface units (DCIUs), xenon tank (Reference (3)), and xenon feed system (XFS).

{"id": 16104, "data": "During the terminal countdown for the first attempted launch of Cassini, spacecraft telemetry channels indicated a false alarm condition that delayed verification of spacecraft readiness for launch, and contributed to a delay on the first launch day. In planning for Cassini launch activities, the RED-ALARM strategy was to set critical measurement alarms for telemetry values differing from those expected at liftoff. As expected, pre-launch conditioning generated a number of red alarms, most of which cleared as the spacecraft was brought to the final liftoff state. However, two red alarms did not clear, resulting in the false alarm conditions. This anomaly was traced to erroneous telemetry documentation: the SAFE/ARM logic states for the two channels whose alarms did not clear were found to be reversed in the data dictionary. The Cassini launch procedure was developed late in the Assemble, Test, and Launch Operations (ATLO) process, and alarm testing with correct parameters was not done. Also, testing of these particular alarms prior to actual launch was not possible at KSC due to safety considerations. The Mars Pathfinder (MPF) project developed their launch procedure early, and subjected it to rigorous, multiple tests during their 18-month ATLO. In this case, additional testing had negligible cost and schedule impact since it was conducted in conjunction with other testing to gain operating hours.

Careful attention to detail in ultrasonic testing can result in the identification of very small cracks, debonds, voids or inclusions in aerospace hardware that could be detrimental to mission performance. New ultrasonic technologies are enhancing the accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness of this method of nondestructive testing. Implementation: As schematically illustrated on Figures 1, 2, and 3 there are three principal methods of ultrasonic testing of aerospace materials: (1) the pulse-echo method; (2) the through-transmission method; and (3) the pitch-catch method. These three ultrasonic methods use pulses of energy during testing operations. These methods and their principal use in support of MSFC projects and technology programs are described below: 1. The pulse-echo method (Figure 1). In the pulse-echo method, a piezoelectric transducer with its longitudinal axis located perpendicular to and mounted on or near the surface of the test material is used to transmit and receive ultrasonic energy. The ultrasonic waves are reflected by the opposite face of the material or by discontinuities, layers, voids, or inclusions in the material, and received by the same transducer where the reflected energy is converted into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is computer processed for display on a video monitor or TV screen. The display can show the relative thickness of the material, depth into the material where flaws are located, and (with proper scanning hardware and software), where the flaws are located in the X-Y plane. In aerospace applications, the pulse-echo method is used primarily for the detection of flaws in metals, but has been used for first and second bondline interrogation in solid rocket motors (each transmitted/received wave in Figure 1 represents a pulse of energy). [D] 2. The through-transmission method (Figure 2). In the through-transmission method, an ultrasonic transmitter is used on one side of the material while a detector is placed on the opposite side. Scanning of the material using this method will result in the location of defects, flaws, and inclusions in the X-Y plane. This method is used for nondestructive testing of multi-layered and multicomponent materials as encountered in solid rocket motor case/insulation/liner/propellants, in composite materials, and on highly attenuative materials. (Each transmitted/received wave in Figure 2 represents a pulse of energy.) [D] 3. The pitch-catch method (Figure 3). The pitch-catch method, in which the ultrasonic energy is transmitted at any angle to the surface of the material and received as reflected energy returning at the reflected angle, is used primarily for cylindrical tubes and other nonlinear parallel sided surfaces. The pitch-catch method can determine depths of the flaw in the material as well as detect the location in the X-Y plane through scanning. (Each transmitted/received wave in Figure 3 represents a pulse of energy.) [D] All three methods are most effective on parallel sided surfaces, but techniques are being developed to inspect variable thickness materials or parts if and when the variation in thickness relative to the X-Y plane is known precisely. Precautions to be observed in ultrasonic testing include: (1) acoustical impedance matching of the sensors with the subject test material through the use of the correct coupling media; (2) use of air-coupling for moisture-sensitive materials; (3) resolution requirements needed to discriminate between adjacent anomalies; and (4) the use of electronic methods wherever possible to make corrections in distance inaccuracies encountered due to ultrasonic beam spreading; (5) characteristics of the transducer(s); and (6) the dependence of resolution on index, scan speed, repetition frequency, computer speed, etc., when using automated scanning. Water has been the best coupling media because of its ready availability, low viscosity, and its relatively safe use with most spacecraft construction materials. When immersion in water is not practical or desirable due to potential moisture absorption, material contamination, or part sizes and configurations, various forms of squirters bubblers have been devised to introduce a layer of water between the sensor and the material to serve as an acoustic coupler. In the pitch-catch method, a water-based gel has proven to be the most practical coupling agent. For solid propellant rocket motors, an elastomeric material similar to solid rocket propellant is used for acoustic coupling of sensors to the material during testing. Ultrasonic transmitters and receivers encased in a water jet nozzle have been used to provide continuous coupling during testing of large areas by continuously injecting a plane of water between the sensor and the material being tested. The most thoroughly researched application of ultrasonic testing at MSFC has been the detection of bond line failures between the case and insulation, the insulation and liner, and the liner and propellant. Ultrasonic waves can be focused at an oblique angle to establish the integrity of adhesive bonding. These oblique ultrasonic excitations cause standing waves in any unbonded areas which can then be detected by conventional ultrasonic methods. In this manner, weak or kissing bonds can be detected. NASA has had considerable success in detecting imperfections and debonds between the case or insulation and the liner, but work is continuing to develop reliable methods of detecting debonds at the second bondline between the liner and the propellant. In materials that have high attenuation impedance such as solid rocket propellants, relatively low ultrasonic frequencies (50kHz in an available ultrasonic range of 3kHz to 50MHz) are more effective than the high ultrasonic frequencies used for metals. Rapid strides are being made in information processing and display techniques which filter out extraneous acoustic signals and provide improved visual images of ultrasonic testing results. The pulse-echo method regularly reveals defects down to .047 inch in diameter. Through-transmission methods have been able to detect anomalies of .050 inch in diameter, which are far smaller than those which could detrimentally affect a solid rocket motor's performance. Ultrasonic capability to detect flaws depends on the wavelength (derived from the frequency and wave velocity). A general rule of thumb for the detection limit is: the smallest detectable flaw size is half the wavelength. The use of higher frequencies improves the sensitivity to small flaws, however there is an increase in the wave attenuation and the noise due to scattering from the material microstructure. Also, in any ultrasonic test there is a dead zone caused by the finite pulse length. This dead zone leads to the inability to detect flaws near the surfaces of the test materials. Ultrasonic testing personnel should be qualified and certified in accordance with MIL-STD-410E or SNT-TC-1A. Technical Rationale: Selection criteria for NDE techniques, specifically ultrasonic techniques, has been a subject of research by MSFC's Materials and Processes Laboratory for a number of years. These techniques have been verified by Thiokol Corporation, Martin Marietta, Aerojet, SAIC, The Naval Surface Warfare Center, and others.

{"id": 16107, "data": "The successful 35-minute Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI) maneuver on July 4, 2016 allowed the planet Jupiter to capture the Juno spacecraft. The NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) then began preparing for the final major burn designed to change its orbit, with a period of 54 days, to its 14-day nominal operational science orbit. The final major burn to slow Juno and place the spacecraft in a tighter orbit around the planet (Figure 1) was planned as a period reduction maneuver (PRM), sometimes referred to for this mission as a Perijove Reduction Maneuver (although geometric perijove was not being changed by the maneuver). The PRM was intended as a regulated main engine burn in which both the fuel and oxidizer tank pressures are regulated during the burn by a helium pressurization system. This regulatory system is connected to the fuel and oxidizer tanks via passive check valves, and pyrolitic isolation valves in the oxidizer side (Figure 2). Figure 1. Juno’s orbital grid During preparations for the Juno PRM on October 13, 2016, telemetry on tank pressure readings revealed an anomaly during the pre-PRM tank pressurization activity (Reference (1)). A series of check valves between the helium tank and the fuel tanks remained closed for about four minutes after imposition of a positive pressure difference that should have immediately opened them. Further review of telemetry showed the oxidizer check valves had also malfunctioned in the same mode but to a lesser extent during the first few minutes of the prior burn-- the JOI maneuver performed in July. The telemetry further showed unexpected gas-side pressure increases suggestive of unintended upstream flow when the oxidizer tank pressure exceeded the gas-side pressure during the Deep Space Maneuver (DSM-2) performed 45 months earlier. Figure 2. A simplified Juno Propulsion Subsystem block diagram. Juno utilizes a weight-saving and redundant approach to spacecraft propulsion, with a bi-propellant main propulsion system and a monopropellant Reaction Control System. The main propulsion system uses hydrazine as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer. Lower than expected pressures in either the fuel or oxidizer tanks can result in unintended oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratios in the main engine during the burn, with potential effects ranging from under-performance (to nominal performance) to catastrophic failure. Hence, the “stuck-closed check valve” anomaly eventually led to a decision by the Juno project to forego the PRM altogether. The most likely cause for the pre-PRM fuel check valve anomaly was contamination, with the contaminant consisting of vapor fuel-oxidizer reaction products (FORP). The pre-JOI failure of the oxidizer check valve to immediately open is believed to be caused by excessive oxidizer exposure; but it could also be FORP contamination, with either possibility caused by an oxidizer leak failure that occurred in the previous maneuver (DSM-2). According to this scenario, the earlier oxidizer check valve leak failure (at DSM-2) produced excessive amounts of oxidizer in the gas side leading to: The oxidizer check valves sticking closed (at pre-JOI). The high oxidizer vapor content creating FORP at the fuel check valves. The FORP leading to the subsequent “stuck closed check valve” anomaly at pre-PRM. Because FORP contamination was a well–known failure mode during Juno design and development, multiple safeguards, such as quad-redundant check valves and oxidizer-side pyrolitic isolation valves, were employed. But these measures were obviously insufficient. While an anomaly resolution team determined that the fuel tank could be pressurized and a main engine burn executed in a blowdown mode to execute the PRM-- even in the presence of the anomalous check valves-- the project elected to avoid the risk of possibly attaining a less-than-desirable orbit and remain in the 53-day capture orbit for the remainder of the Juno mission. The higher-than-planned orbital period does not affect the quality of the science collected by Juno during each flyby because the altitude over Jupiter is the same at the time of closest approach. In terms of the total quantity of science return, it has recently been announced (Reference (3)) that the Juno mission will be extended three years until at least July 2021 so it can complete the additional 18 perijoves needed to finish mapping Jupiter. Another outcome of the longer orbit is that Juno will spend less time within Jupiter’s radiation belts on each orbit, reducing the accumulated radiation exposure of the spacecraft.

The mission was a joint venture of several space agencies and U.S. research agencies including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research, as well as the space agencies of Canada, France, Germany, and Japan, and the European Space Agency. While the Neurolab mission was an overall success, it experienced several on-orbit hardware failures and problems that could have been minimized or prevented had adequate crew training been accomplished. In fact, the crew had not been used several of the flight system configurations until on-orbit.", "label": [[754, 780, "MOD"], [842, 864, "REC"]], "Lesson ID": 1613}
{"id": 16125, "data": "A 125 pound per square inch pressure air line in a ground trench, used to supply test facilities, failed by splitting along the longitudinal weld. The 10 inch diameter steel pipe ruptured for a distance of about 15 feet. As a result of this failure, four manhole covers were blown into the air. The air line that failed was in a covered ground trench and had been in place for about 15 years. During this time, moisture was present from surface water leakage and considerable corrosion had taken place on the pipe outside diameter. Inspection of the failed pipe revealed that the original thickness of 1/4 inch was reduced to almost zero in some places as a result of the corrosion. The failure was due to the corroded pipe no longer being able to withstand the internal working pressure.", "label": [[108, 145, "MOD"], [168, 187, "MOD"], [250, 293, "EFF"], [241, 248, "MOD"], [476, 485, "CAU"], [411, 431, "CAU"], [437, 458, "CAU"], [710, 723, "CAU"], [724, 787, "CAU"], [687, 694, "MOD"]], "Lesson ID": 241}
{"id": 16127, "data": "JPL has responsibility for the development, integration, and testing of the payload (including the canister and collector arrays) for the Genesis Project, a mission to collect solar wind particles and return them to Earth. While the Genesis canister was being lifted from the transportation dolly at JPL in preparation for system-level thermal vacuum testing on May 3, 2000, the lift fixture detached at one of the three swivel hoist ring tension fittings. [D] Prior to mounting on the test chamber door, one corner of the canister fell ~5 centimeters (~2 inches) back onto the dolly. Nearby personnel cushioned the fall, and there was no damage to the Canister or support equipment, or serious injury to personnel. Post-incident inspection revealed that the threaded fastener had backed out of the fixture and became detached. Additionally, the fasteners at the other tension fittings, and at the upper hoist point, were found only hand-tight. The lift fixture assembly had been proof tested 8 months earlier. The fixture had been reassembled by the vendor following the proof test and dye penetrant inspection of the swivel hoist fittings. The fixture had last been used to lift the Canister two days prior to this incident. The fixture was visually inspected prior to the May 3, 2000 lift incident, but the hoist rings were not checked for tightness. There is no evidence that the hoist ring fasteners had been properly torqued since the proof test. The procedure governing the canister lift operation (Reference 2) did not require adequate checking of all fasteners prior to attaching the fixture to the hoist.

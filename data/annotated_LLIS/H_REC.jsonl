{"id": 675, "data": "PRIMARY CAUSE - THE HYDROGEN (H2) PURGE VENT PORT ON ORBITER OV-104 WAS CAPPED. Finding 1: The H2 purge vent port was capped although there were no steps in OMI V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3 to cap the vent. Recommendation: An alert should be widely circulated to all technicians and quality inspectors emphasizing the criticality of rigorously following procedures. The alert should include the necessity to obtain a deviation to the work document to perform any work (including usual shop practices that alter configuration of the vehicle or ground support equipment [GSE] not specifically identified in the OMI. Finding 2: None of the personnel involved (two mechanical technicians and a quality inspector) were aware of the criticality of the H2 purge vent port remaining clear and open at all times. Recommendation: Precautionary notes should be included in OMI V1093 relative to not capping critical vents that must remain clear and open. All OMI's should be reviewed to identify such vents and appropriate precautionary notes incorporated. Placards should be utilized on the vehicle to identify critical vents that must remain clear and open. Finding 3: System training and certification relative thereto are not required for technicians or quality inspectors working on the Orbiter. Recommendation: System training and knowledge should be made part of certification requirements for all technicians and quality inspectors and should be one of the primary considerations for pay increases and promotions. System training should be made available during off-shift hours. A systematic review of all training and certification requirements should be accomplished across the contractor organization. Currency and proficiency training should be a major consideration. Finding 4: The two mechanical technicians and the quality inspector assigned to perform OMI V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3 had no previous on-the-job training or experience performing this task. Recommendation: Technicians and quality inspectors should not be assigned to a task they have not previously performed without the supervision of a system engineer, supervisor, or another experienced technician who has performed the task. Finding 5: With the exception of the part number, the nomenclature on the \"bulkhead\" fitting did not agree with the nomenclature in the OMI. Recommendation: Orbiter and GSE displayed nomenclature should be reviewed to ensure it is consistent with the OMI's. Finding 6: Operation and maintenance instructions are reviewed and approved by several organizations/contractors. This review and approval process involves system engineering, quality engineering, and safety. After engineering approval, portions of the OMI's are handed over to the technicians to perform without any requirement for further engineering involvement or direction. Recommendation: Station system engineering personnel in the OPF to witness and direct the conduct of their respective OMI's. CONTRIBUTING CAUSE: FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE THE LACK OF H2 FLOW AND TO GENERATE AN INTERIM PROBLEM REPORT (IPR). Finding 7: The second shift fuel cell system engineer did not prepare an IPR for either of the anomalies, i.e., the failure of the 02 reactant valve to close on command and the lack of H2 flow with the H2 reactant valve closed and the purge valve open. Recommendation: Re-emphasize to engineers that IPR's must be prepared and documented real time for all anomalous conditions. OBSERVATIONS 1: The midbody mechanical supervisor and lead mechanical technician were off work the night of the mishap. The midbody lead electrical technician was supervising the mechanical technicians. He was not familiar with the capabilities of the personnel or the task being performed. Recommendation: In the absence of a discipline supervisor and lead technician, supervision should be delegated to the next senior technician within that discipline on the shift. The delegation and chain of command should be clearly understood. 2: On March 19, during OMI V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3 on Orbiter Columbia, OV-102 (OPF High Bay 1), the H2 purge vent port was also capped. An experienced technician sent to review the work found the purge vent port capped and directed the cap be removed. The incident was reported to the supervisor but there was no shop-wide awareness. The inadvertent capping was neither discussed at \"tailgate\" meetings nor were engineering and quality notified. Recommendation: Any improper performance of an OMI step should be documented and generate a review of that OMI by the shop supervisor, engineering, and quality to determine if the document needs to be revised. When improper work practices are discovered an alert should be generated and circulated within the technician, engineering, and quality organizations. These alerts should be discussed at weekly \"tailgate\" meetings. Engineers should attend technician \"tailgate\" meetings to discuss system issues or problems related to processing which are of interest to both groups. 3: A walkdown of the area was not performed prior to fuel cell venting. Recommendation: A walkdown should be performed by engineers in the OPF prior to initiating an OMI, significant tasks, or subsequent to configuration changes affecting future work. Walkdowns should be accomplished in a timely manner for the OMI steps to be performed. 4: Deviation 37-01 was not logged at the work control station and the first fuel cell venting was attempted per OMI V5RO1, step 37-005. Two active work authorization documents (WAD's) existed at the beginning of first shift, April 4, to vent the fuel cell (PR PV6-156255 and OMI V5RO1, step 37-005). The fuel cell system engineers on first and second shift, respectively, each worked the venting procedure on different WAD's. Recommendation: Deviations generated to WAD's must be logged into work control as they are generated in order to ensure work is accomplished in accordance with current and authorized procedures. The need for a coordinated work plan between shifts should be re-emphasized to all personnel. 5: Quality inspectors are assigned work on an indiscriminate basis by a call board system. Recommendation: A quality supervisor should assign work to quality inspectors based on their experience and knowledge. 6: The remote location of the control rooms in the Launch Control Center (LCC) some distance from the OPF creates a natural barrier between engineering and technicians making communications and observation of work difficult. Recommendation: When new control rooms are provided they should be located within the orbiter processing facilities. 7: There is not an effective procedure to identify the constraints open grounds will have on systems. Recommendation: A procedure should be established to notify system engineers that removal of electrical grounds will be a constraint to testing. 8: Engineering log books are extremely important in the shift turnover communication process. They are sometimes hard to follow. Recommendation: Emphasize to engineers the need to keep log books neat and orderly and to highlight anomalies. 9. The NASA/JSC engineers (the design center) reviewed all the vehicle OMI's for XSC checkout after the Challenger accident. The Presidential Commission recommended the design centers become involved in the review of operating and maintenance instructions utilized at KSC. Design center participation, including concurrence in changes affecting Criticality 1 and 1R items, was also directed by the Associate Administrator for Space Flight's letter of March 24, 1986, Strategy for Safely Returning the Space Shuttle to Flight Status. NASA/JSC concurred in the OMI process until approximately one year ago. An agreement was then made with KSC that JSC would no longer concur on the OMI's or changes thereto. A KSC contractor has been concurring as the design center's representative and is responsible for coordination with the Orbiter subsystem managers at JSC. Recommendation: The NASA/JSC subsystem managers should review all OMI's for compliance with the Orbiter Maintenance Requirements and Specification Document (OMRSD) and for clarity. There should be provisions for the subsystem managers to review all OMI's and changes thereto on a periodic basis. NASA/KSC engineering should validate all OMI's to ensure clarity and that they are sufficiently definitive for utilization by operating personnel. They should also be reviewed for compatibility with good shop practices. 10. NASA/JSC subsystem managers do not generally review contractor training material. Recommendation: The NASA/JSC subsystem managers and flight controllers working with NASA/KSC engineering should review all Lockheed KSC training courses for engineers, technicians, and quality personnel, relative to their respective subsystems, for accuracy and adequacy. 11. System training material is not effectively shared between KSC and the design centers. Recommendation: A joint training group with representation from all centers should be organized to ensure the effective sharing of material and resources between JSC, KSC, MSFC, and Stennis. 12: Observation Training is not identified as a major function within the contractor organization. At the Johnson Space Center, 183 civil service and contractor personnel are assigned to an organization devoted exclusively to Shuttle training. They are responsible for training approximately 550 personnel per year. The number of people assigned to Shuttle and Ground Support Engineering, Orbiter Processing and Shops, and SRM&QA within the contractor organization totals approximately 2500 personnel. Training for these 2500 personnel is provided by the contractor training organization (a part of Logistics) totaling 41 people. Training should be and will be a major activity throughout the life of the Space Shuttle Program at KSC. Recommendation: Training should be designated as a separate and major functional entity at the same level as the engineering, operations, logistics, and quality groups within the contractor organization.", "label": [[20, 78, "CAU"], [95, 124, "CAU"], [234, 267, "REC"], [341, 372, "REC"], [378, 383, "REC"], [403, 455, "REC"], [633, 663, "CAU"], [722, 746, "CAU"], [828, 847, "REC"], [956, 980, "REC"], [1054, 1096, "REC"], [1168, 1235, "CAU"], [1314, 1393, "REC"], [1519, 1559, "REC"], [1586, 1650, "REC"], [1710, 1743, "REC"], [1910, 1955, "CAU"], [1994, 2120, "REC"], [2271, 2356, "CAU"], [2400, 2431, "REC"], [2512, 2550, "CON"], [2594, 2621, "CON"], [2728, 2853, "CAU"], [2870, 2917, "REC"], [2999, 3041, "CAU"], [3049, 3083, "CAU"], [3129, 3168, "CAU"], [3360, 3428, "REC"], [3679, 3758, "CAU"], [3839, 3900, "REC"], [3942, 4002, "REC"], [4157, 4203, "CON"], [4274, 4313, "CON"], [4480, 4540, "REC"], [4545, 4574, "REC"], [4721, 4761, "REC"], [4831, 4857, "REC"], [4889, 4943, "REC"], [5046, 5084, "CAU"], [5131, 5159, "REC"], [5293, 5344, "REC"], [5383, 5413, "CAU"], [5822, 5866, "REC"], [6016, 6037, "REC"], [6098, 6161, "CAU"], [6204, 6303, "REC"], [6312, 6383, "CAU"], [6429, 6472, "CAU"], [6480, 6528, "CAU"], [6555, 6568, "REC"], [6597, 6645, "REC"], [6659, 6713, "CAU"], [6767, 6825, "REC"], [6997, 7021, "CAU"], [7039, 7105, "REC"], [7113, 7132, "REC"], [7150, 7210, "CON"], [7303, 7389, "REC"], [7407, 7434, "CON"], [8024, 8081, "REC"], [8192, 8261, "REC"], [8300, 8337, "REC"], [8348, 8355, "REC"], [8374, 8397, "REC"], [8458, 8509, "REC"], [8524, 8595, "CAU"], [8626, 8749, "REC"], [8880, 8923, "CAU"], [8978, 9055, "REC"], [9070, 9113, "REC"], [9155, 9213, "CAU"], [9781, 9789, "CON"], [9902, 9973, "REC"]], "Lesson ID": 1182}

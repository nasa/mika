The IDC purge components were not designed to prevent overpressurization, which caused system failure. Instead of a Bepco enclosure pressure control valve, a Bepco control panel rapid-exchange valve was used to control GN2 system purge. This allowed the rapid release of overpressure, which in turn caused the system to fail. The IDC single-stage regulator was found to have vibrated open, causing the inlet pressure to increase (creep) to 50 psi. The nominal operational pressure setting is 10 psi. This increase in the inlet pressure setting allowed the system to become overpressurized and caused the system to fail. The IDC camera head enclosure lid was not sealed properly because of ground wire interference, which caused a differential in system pressure between enclosures. The bottom clip on the IDC camera battery, power supply, and power supply enclosure were seated but did not catch the enclosure door, which contributed to system purge leakage. NASA lab personnel completed measurement testing before the ICD was put into operational use. However, purge system operation and functional checkout were not performed, which prevented detection of system overpressurization before operational use. The current operational procedure, MDA Prototype Ice Detection Camera User Manual Rev 4.0, was not followed. Use of that operational procedure might have prevented the system overpressurization. A new local procedure for field use will be developed containing all operational steps, notes, cautions, and warnings.

{"id": 157, "data": "On Saturday, March 31, the mid-body mechanical supervisor and the lead mechanical technician both had the day off. Supervision was delegated to the lead electrical technician for that shift. He was not familiar with the work to be accomplished or with the capabilities and experience levels of the individuals assigned from the mechanical group. Two individuals were assigned to a task they had not previously performed or observed. The quality inspector was a check and balance that might have caught the error had he been assigned based on his experience with the task or his knowledge of the system. Quality inspectors are not given inspection work based upon their knowledge or previous inspection assignments. They respond to a call-board that lists tasks calling for an inspector; consequently, an inspector appears in a somewhat indiscriminate fashion to perform the inspection task. On second shift, Saturday, March 31, three people unfamiliar with the task came together on platform 4 west to perform and verify Operations and Maintenance Instruction (OMI) V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3. The lead mechanical technician from first shift stayed over to take the assigned technician to platform 4 west to review the task. He failed to mention that the purge vent port should not be capped after removal of the flex hose. There was no precautionary note in the OMI addressing the need to keep the purge vent port clear and open and no placard on the Orbiter. One of the significant shop practices stressed to all technicians working around the Orbiter is to cap disconnected lines or openings to avoid contamination. Personnel are therefore naturally conditioned to cap lines and openings. The fuel cell had to be vented to ambient pressure prior to its removal. The first attempt to vent the fuel cell by a fuel cell system engineer occurred on Wednesday, April 4, at approximately 2 a.m. EDT. The fuel cell was not damaged at this point because the 02 reactant valve did not close. The fact that there was no H2 flow was observed but no Interim Problem Report (IPR) was initiated. A disconnected ground wire from the 02 reactant valve prevented the valve from closing and consequently protected the fuel cell from any damage. A walkdown was not accomplished by engineering. Had such a procedure been implemented, the damage might have been avoided as the fuel cell system engineer might have been alerted to the disconnected ground wire and the capped purge vent port. One thread that runs through the series of events leading up to the mishap is the lack of system training for technicians and quality inspectors. Technicians and quality inspectors are trained and certified in their basic skills, i.e, lockwiring, torquing, etc.; however, they are given no Orbiter systems training. Another factor that contributed to this mishap is the lack of communication between engineering, technicians, and quality. All OMI's are reviewed and approved in detail by several engineering organizations. Some portions of these approved OMI's are then handed over to shop personnel (technicians) to be performed without requiring additional engineering involvement. This same situation exists with the quality inspector who must approve the technicians' work. The personnel are highly motivated and want very much to do a good job. It is essential that they be given the knowledge they need to do that job. The importance of keeping the purge vent port clear and open was not communicated by anyone in the process. The capping of the Orbiter H2 purge vent port during the performance of OMI V1093 Post Operations Instruction #3 was not an isolated incident. On March 19, the same port was capped on the Orbiter Columbia, OV-102, during performance of the same OMI. In this case, an experienced technician checking the work caught the error and had the cap removed. The supervisor was notified but no subsequent action was taken. Had this near-miss been properly communicated to all technicians, engineering, and quality, perhaps the mishap two weeks later could have been avoided. The significance of effective communications cannot be overemphasized in the very complex world of Orbiter processing and test operations. Communications and identification of precautions in the OMI and a good working relationship between the technicians, the engineers, and quality personnel is essential to successful operations. The geography of KSC facilities does not lend itself to ease of overview or development of team unity. The Launch Control Center (LCC) control rooms, from which systems engineers conduct tests, are a considerable distance from the OPF where technicians perform work on the vehicle. The remoteness of the two facilities impedes communications between engineers and technicians. As the program plans new control rooms and equipment, these new rooms could be located in the OPF between the two bays. Many benefits would be derived from the control rooms being in such a location. Having the engineers in close proximity to technicians and the vehicle would improve the overall efficiency of orbiter processing as well as communications among all parties. A key factor in achieving a higher flight rate is reducing OPF flow time. This change could substantially enhance KSC's capability to achieve shorter processing flows. The ability of engineers to perform walkdowns prior to implementing test operations would be greatly facilitated by their proximity and involvement with the work. Operations and Maintenance Instructions are obviously the key documents in ensuring work is done properly at KSC. A review to ensure they are correct and adequate is essential. Following the Challenger accident, direction was given to the design centers to review and concur in all OMI's that affected Criticality 1 or 1R equipment as well as changes to those OMI's. A commitment was also made to the Congress that this would be implemented. In the case of the orbiter, this does not now occur. The Johnson Space Center did review and concur in all OMI's after the Challenger accident and, until the summer of 1989, the JSC Resident Office at KSC concurred in all changes. The apparent lack of discipline in utilizing the paper system resulted in a communication breakdown and confusion that may have contributed to the mishap. There should be a coordinated and documented plan of action between work shifts for accomplishing processing and testing. First and second shifts utilized two different work authorization documents (WAD's) to perform the same task. An IPR was not prepared when anomalous conditions were observed. Constraints were not identified when performing electrical work, i.e., removal of ground wires. A deviation was not logged in a timely fashion. The technicians, engineers, and inspectors at KSC are a highly motivated and dedicated team. Processing and testing of Orbiters is a very complex and demanding task. These personnel are indeed on the firing line three shifts a day, seven days a week. Problems and difficulties are always present. With so much depending upon their ability to perform their work, it behooves us to provide them with all the skills and talents they require. Training, knowledge, and communications are all essential to the task. The cost for repair of this fuel cell is significant, but considering Space Shuttle Operations will continue for as long as 20 more years, it could be an inexpensive lesson if we can learn from this accident and truly apply the lessons learned.", "label": [[115, 140, "CAU"], [198, 224, "CAU"], [256, 290, "CAU"], [437, 454, "CON"], [1238, 1301, "CAU"], [1344, 1365, "CAU"], [1444, 1454, "CAU"], [1494, 1536, "CON"], [1653, 1700, "CAU"], [2048, 2093, "CAU"], [2242, 2271, "CAU"], [2565, 2588, "CAU"], [2770, 2797, "CAU"], [2853, 2874, "CAU"], [2926, 2957, "CON"], [3203, 3259, "CON"], [3362, 3391, "REC"], [3412, 3489, "CAU"], [3783, 3841, "CON"], [3870, 3893, "CON"], [3939, 3975, "REC"], [4102, 4126, "REC"], [4221, 4235, "REC"], [4240, 4269, "REC"], [4287, 4374, "REC"], [4418, 4445, "CAU"], [4700, 4732, "CAU"], [4851, 4888, "REC"], [5002, 5061, "REC"], [5132, 5146, "REC"], [5456, 5465, "REC"], [5470, 5495, "REC"], [5497, 5536, "REC"], [5613, 5619, "REC"], [5754, 5784, "REC"], [6021, 6051, "CON"], [6117, 6168, "CON"], [6183, 6231, "CAU"], [6246, 6269, "CAU"], [6274, 6283, "CAU"], [6343, 6384, "REC"], [6480, 6530, "CAU"], [6560, 6580, "CAU"], [6622, 6653, "CAU"], [6720, 6744, "CAU"], [7146, 7203, "REC"], [7205, 7213, "REC"], [7215, 7224, "REC"], [7230, 7244, "REC"]], "Lesson ID": 1182}

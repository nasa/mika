"This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1240; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: Early identification, tracking, and control of critical items through the preparation, implementation, and maintenance of CILs will provide valuable inputs to a design, development, and production program. From the CIL activity, critical design features, tests, inspection points, and procedures can be identified and implemented that will minimize the probability of failure of a mission or loss of life. Implementation Method: I. Background The Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is performed to identify failure modes. As part of this process, critical failure modes that could lead to loss of life or loss of mission are also identified. These critical failure modes are then placed into a CIL, which is carefully examined for programmatic control by implementing inspection requirements, test requirements and/or special design features or changes which would minimize the failure mode occurrence. Failure Mode and Effects Analyses and resulting CILs can be used not only as a check of the design of systems for reliability, but also as main design drivers for the product or service. Reliability management is the activity involved in coordinating the reliability analyses of design, development, manufacturing, testing, and operations to obtain the proper performance of a given product under specified environmental conditions. Reliability management interfaces with the program management function, the design function, the manufacturing function, the test and inspection function, and the quality function. Reliability management is approached through the formulation and preparation of reliability plans, the performance of specific product design analysis, the support of classical reliability analysis activities, and project/product team participation using concurrent engineering methodologies (see NASA Reliability Design Practice GD-ED-2204). The FMEA/CIL Process (shown on Figure 1) plays a key role in reliability management. Principal outputs of the FMEA/CIL process are CILs (shown on the lower right-hand corner of Figure 1). [D] Figure 1. FMEA/CIL Analysis Process II. Critical Items Lists and Retention Rationale Specific lessons have been learned that will change the value of preparing and maintaining (CILs) early in high-technology, multi-disciplinary aerospace programs and projects. Critical Items Lists are identified through the conduct of a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA). The FMEA Process (see Reliability Preferred Practice No. PD-AP-1307) involves a bottom-up analysis of each hardware or software element in a complex system for each possible failure mode. The determination of the ìworst caseî effect of that failure on the system is then determined. If the item can fail in a mode which could result in the loss of life or vehicle or in loss of the mission, the item is placed on a Critical Items List. The FMEA, and resulting CIL, is most effective when it is performed concurrently with the design process and maintained throughout the life of a program or project. The FMEA results in the identification of single failure points (SFPs) and critical redundant items. A typical SFP is defined as a single item of hardware (usually at the component level) the failure of which could result in the loss of life, vehicle, mission, or damage to a vehicle system. It is the general policy of NASA not to permit the retention of single failure points in design unless special conditions prohibit designing it out, such as technology, operations or cost. Retention of a single failure point requires that a justification or rationale be prepared which describes actions taken, safety margins, failure prevention measures, tests, or inspections that will ensure that the critical item of hardware will not fail in the mode indicated in the FMEA. Typical rationale for retention of hardware or software items on a projectís Critical Items List includes information on design, testing, inspection, failure history, and operational use as described below: Design Rationale: Design rationale identifies design features and/or margins that have been provided in the design of the hardware or software element which minimize or eliminate the probability of occurrence of the failure mode and/or reduction or elimination of the potential causes of the failure mode. Test Rationale: Test rationale includes a description of specific tests that have been completed to detect potential failure causes during acceptance and certification tests. Inspection Rationale: Inspection rationale addresses specific inspection methods, procedures, tools, and techniques that are used in the hardware or software manufacturing, assembly, and integration process to detect susceptibility to failure modes or to detect and assess the probability of encountering failure modes and their potential causes. Failure History: Failure history and corrective actions are included as a part of single failure point critical items retention rationale to indicate that the reason for previous failures has been removed or reduced as a potential hazard, and to provide trend analysis. Operational Use: Special operational techniques that would either prevent the particular failure mode or mitigate its effect once it has occurred are included as part of the retention rationale. This rationale includes such factors as flight rules, crew procedures, such as emergency stop features or special crew training. It also includes contingency actions such as extravehicular activity and unplanned in-flight maintenance procedures. The flow of these facets of retention rationale are shown on Figure 2. [D] Figure 2. CIL Retention Rationale Process III. Suggestions for Effective CIL Implementation Correlation of FMEA Results with Fault-Tree Analyses and Hazards Analyses: The FMEA/CIL data can serve as an input to the hazard analysis process. The hazards analysis uses fault trees and is basically a top down approach. It focuses on human errors and considers multiple unrelated failure modes which the FMEA/CIL ground rules out. The Use of Probabilistic Risk Assessments: Probabilistic risk assessments have proven to be useful procedures in providing product development teams with an insight into factors of safety and to strengthen critical item or single failure point retention rationale. Margins of safety have a strong influence on the acceptability of retaining potential failure modes or critical items if it can be proven that risk of failure is reduced to an acceptably low level. Process, Equipment, and Facility Critical Items Analyses: Failures in manufacturing, assembly, and test processes, equipment, and facilities have only an indirect effect on the freedom of flight hardware and software from mission or life-threatening occurrences. Nevertheless, the conduct of process, equipment, and manufacturing facility FMEAs can provide valuable assistance in identifying critical items whose failure could impact system performance or availability. Statistical process control methods, if used prudently in the manufacture of hardware can assist in the detection of conditions which could lead to impending failures affecting performance or schedule. Computer-Aided Management of Critical Items: Common numbering systems coupled with the use of electronic data processing techniques, can speed up the CIL implementation and management process. Where failure modes or causes are identical or related for various system elements, these failure modes or causes can be referenced rather than repeated, reducing the volume of text in retention rationale. Critical item listings can be more easily referenced to corresponding information derived from fault-tree analyses and hazards analyses if there is a common numbering system. CIL Retention Rationale as a Road-Map: Critical Item List retention rationale that is developed very early in hardware or software programs can be used as a road-map for development plans, tests, and inspections. Development program content, then, can be tailored specifically to prevent loss of mission, vehicle, and human life. This road-map could be used to identify inspection points and to help avoid too many series inspections of the same hardware. Critical Items List should be worked in a way that would not impact important program milestones or create unnecessary work-around in the areas of cost, schedules, or performance. For example, processing methods are needed to quickly disposition discrepancies in critical items. IV. Example Uses of Critical Items Lists The uses of CILs are many. Among the more important uses are: (1) analysis of a product, process or project for reliability and failure avoidance before, during, and after the design process; (2) evaluation of the impact of design, material, or fabrication changes on reliability; (3) assessment of failures experienced during testing; (4) recommendation of design changes that will avoid failure recurrences; and (5) determination of the risk of retaining mission critical or life endangering single failure points or redundant failure modes. Some specific examples of typical applications of the FMEA/CIL methodology as an aid to design follow: Spacelab Recertification after the Challenger Incident During the Spacelab recertification effort after the Challenger accident, the FMEA revealed a potential single failure point in the jettison circuitry of the Inertial Pointing System (IPS). A condition existed in which a short in the emergency arming switch could cause the firing of all four NASA Standard Initiators (NSIs). The analysis also revealed that the harness separator would not fire under these conditions. The detailed FMEA analysis of the wiring harnesses also revealed several mission critical wiring anomalies that had to be corrected. Additionally, the payload retention latch assembly was found to be in need of a redundant operational mode. As a result, redundant end switches were added. Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) Project During routine review and assessment of the CILs for the RSRM, it was observed that the specifications for the finish of the secondary sealing surfaces for nozzle joints three and four (inlet to throat joints) were inadequate to retain a 1R criticality ranking (which is a criticality 1 failure mode but with a second or redundant system). Defects of up to 50-mil depth were permitted on the secondary sealing surface while defects of only 3-mil depth had to be reworked for blending if they occurred in the primary seals. A CIL analysis indicated that actually a criticality 1 (potential loss of life) criticality ranking existed. Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Independent Risk Assessment Team When contamination was discovered in the bearing cage of SSME No. 1209, a special independent risk assessment team was established to assess the problem and to determine if the engine was safe to fly. The team relied heavily on the FMEA/CIL analyses that had already been performed by NASA/MSFC and the SSME contractor personnel in order to understand the potential for failure and possible safety hazards. The team identified rationale for retention of the condition that caused the contamination, and the engine was judged safe to fly. This engine subsequently flew (many missions) successfully with no indication of potential failure. Technical Rationale: Extensive analytical work on existing and emerging programs relative to failure identification, management, and control has resulted in well documented, rigorous procedures for the treatment of critical items. Concurrent engineering approaches to program engineering and management have included attention to more details earlier in the design process and at a much lower level than previously attained. Assurance of success means the elimination or reduction of potential failure modes. Elimination or reduction of potential failure modes can only be achieved through the conscientious application of failure mode and effect analysis, critical item identification early in the concept/design phase, and prudent engineering management. The advantages of the FMEA/CIL process are that it: (1) Systematically identifies all credible failure modes and causes; (2) permits a focus on critical single failure points and levels of redundancy; (3) provides risk acceptance rationale for critical failure modes/causes; (4) provides management control of critical items, associated procedures, specifications, and processes; and (5) provides a single, agreed-to listing of all critical items associated with a given project.

"This Lessons Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1243; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Fault protection design maximizes the probability of spacecraft mission success by avoiding possible single failure points through the use of autonomous, short-term compensation for failed hardware. Implementation Method: Except during critical event periods, the primary purpose of an autonomous fault protection system is to place the spacecraft in a safe, commandable state which can be maintained for a reasonable period (typically two weeks) following a fault. During critical periods, the primary purpose of the fault protection system is to ensure the completion of the critical event. A simplified block diagram representing the following three general types of fault protection is illustrated in Figure 1: Subsystems alone. Subsystem to system, and System to ground control. [D] Fault Protection Allocations. All on-board, post lift-off, autonomous fault protection is designated as either quotsubsystem internalquot or quotsystemquot fault protection. Fault protection engineering elements which have been allocated fault protection responsibility must provide the requirements and design for the associated detections, monitors, responses, and diagnostic data in compliance with project functional requirements. Where science instruments include fault protection in their design, designers must still ensure compliance with spacecraft project fault protection requirements if one of the following conditions apply: The fault protection internal to the instrument is dependent on non-standard services from another subsystem (or another instrument), or Internal failures have an impact external to the instrument (viz, a change in power state, momentum, support to other instruments). Spacecraft Safing. Spacecraft quotsafingquot is a general purpose safe-state response which is initiated by both system and subsystem internal fault protection. The purpose of this response is to provide the following: A safe state for the hardware An uplink, and A downlink (with some exceptions for specific failure conditions). To achieve these goals, the normal stored sequence is terminated and non-essential spacecraft loads are powered off. Undervoltage Response. Most spacecraft designs include an undervoltage response, which is designed to protect the spacecraft in the event of a short or a bus overload. The hardware senses when the power drops below an established value for a specified time. If the criteria are met, the power system sheds all non-essential loads from the bus and indicates the undervoltage condition to the Command Subsystem, which will initiate the undervoltage recovery response. Critical spacecraft memories are maintained throughout the undervoltage. Functional Implementation Requirements. Fault protection is typically allocated to the on-board elements of the system in accordance with the following principles: Spacecraft versus ground control. Autonomous fault protection is included on board the spacecraft only if a response by Mission Operations is not feasible nor practical, or if action is required within two weeks of detecting the failure. Otherwise, ground control is responsible for fault recovery. In both cases, ground control is responsible for failure diagnosis and, if necessary, the configuration of the spacecraft to nominal operations after the fault. Protection against sabotage and operator errors. To simplify the development of fault protection, autonomous fault protection is not required to protect against sabotage or operator errors, although such protection is not prohibited. There is limited spacecraft protection against these failures (viz, information system data integrity checks and some software checks). Protection against spacecraft hardware and software design errors. To simplify the development of fault protection, autonomous fault protection is usually not required to protect against spacecraft design errors, although it is not prohibited if practical. The practice of fault protection typically provides some limited spacecraft protection against design errors (e.g., thermal fault responses). The autonomous fault protection function is responsible for all on-board fault detections and corrections except those routinely required to ensure spacecraft data integrity (viz, EDAC, Reed Solomon encoder, checksums, etc.). Data error detections and corrections may be used, however, for fault protection purposes. The spacecraft information system typically has the primary responsibility for ensuring data integrity. Fault Protection Design Requirements. Management and coordination of fault detection, monitoring, and response, for both system and subsystem internal fault protection, is performed in accordance with the following general rules: Enables/disables for responses. Where applicable, fault responses should have two enable/disable mechanisms (or the functional equivalent): an enable/disable by stored sequence, and an enable/disable by ground control or by fault protection algorithms. Enables/disables for monitor activation of any response. If a response can be initiated by more than one monitor, those monitors should include an enable/disable mechanism or the functional equivalent. Enable/disable state specification. Each enable/disable is specified by a single parameter unique to each fault protection algorithm. Enable/disable strategy - general. As a goal, fault protection monitors and responses should be designed to be enabled for the entire mission. This reduces the risk of incorrect fault protection states. Enable/disable strategy - critical events. For critical events, enable/disable strategies may be used to minimize or prevent the effects of an erroneous fault indication. Response initiation. Fault responses are initiated if and only if spacecraft performance is unacceptable, or there is a significant risk to the mission or to subsystem safety. Parameter modifications. All fault protection parameters which may reasonably be expected to change as a function of mission mode, type of activity, fault history, or operational experience should be alterable by ground control without requiring flight software modification. Software modifications. To the extent possible, monitor and response algorithms should be stored in programmable RAM. Configuration compatibility. On-board fault protection should be designed to respond to a fault while in any possible spacecraft configuration (e.g., fault protection should be able to accommodate all possible combinations). Independence from instruments. Engineering fault protection should not depend on science instruments or their data. Multiple faults. At a minimum, fault protection should be designed with the assumption that only one fault occurs at a time, and that a subsequent fault will occur no earlier than the response completion time for the first fault. As a goal, fault protection should be capable of recovering from multiple successive or coincident faults provided that the faults and associated fault algorithms are independent. Propagation of failures. Autonomous fault protection assumes that spacecraft hardware design ensures that a single failure in a subsystem (including instruments) cannot propagate to its redundant unit or to another subsystem, or prevent switching to its redundant unit. This can be verified by performing a failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) or fault tree analysis (FTA). Typical Fault Detection Design Requirements. Hardware and software detection sources have two criteria: Direct detection. Detection mechanisms should be as direct as possible (i.e., a direct measurement is preferred over a calculated or derived measurement). Detection coverage. Detection mechanisms should only be required to detect a failure to the level at which that failure can be isolated or corrected. Design Requirements for Fault Monitors. Software monitors used by system and subsystem internal fault protection have the following features: Monitor thresholds. Where possible, thresholds should use reasonableness checks, detection filtering (to exclude certain faults from a previously established fault database), or redundant detections. Threshold modifications. Monitor threshold values should be alterable by ground or sequence command, or by fault protection responses as appropriate. As a goal, monitors are best designed to detect and disregard failed sensors. Redundant detection. For detections where an inadvertent trip would result in a severe response (viz, downlink loss, irreversible hardware swaps, large use of expendables, critical sequence cancellation), and where a sensor anomaly could cause an inadvertent trip, independent physically or functionally redundant detections are employed such that simultaneous detections are necessary for response initiation. Fault response tolerance. Monitors are designed to be tolerant of off-nominal conditions following a reconfiguration resulting from a fault protection response (e.g., thresholds might be relaxed as part of a response). Design Requirements for Fault Responses. System and subsystem internal fault response concerns include: Fault response primary responsibility. Following an anomaly, fault responses should ensure spacecraft commandability and the maintenance of a safe state for at least two weeks. This requirement is superseded only by a requirement to complete a critical event. Fault protection priorities. Fault responses are designed with the following priorities: Protect critical spacecraft functionality, Protect spacecraft performance and consumables, Minimize disruptions to normal sequence operations, and Simplify ground recovery response, including providing for downlink telemetry. Multiple levels of response. Where possible, response design includes multiple levels of response, with the response actions executed in order of increasing severity. Real-time ground responses. Autonomous fault protection is designed so as to not require real-time ground responses for recovery from known faults. False alarm tolerance. Unintended entry into a fault protection response in the absence of a fault must not present a hazard to the spacecraft or mission. For critical event periods, however, this requirement is relaxed and is considered a goal. Use of redundant (and spare) units. Redundant or spare units may be used by autonomous fault protection responses if a satisfactory alternative design is not available. Unpowered redundant units. The transition of a unit from quotoffquot to quotprimequot must not require ground commands in order to support spacecraft fault protection and mission critical functions. Component warm-up times. Fault responses should take into account component warm-up times and similar delay requirements. Data Handling Requirements. The following data handling tasks are performed: Recording engineering data. The combination of sequences and fault responses should ensure the recording of engineering data prior to, during, and after the execution of any fault response. Some exceptions are made for recorder and command subsystems failures. Storage and preservation of diagnostic data. Fault protection is designed to include the storage of diagnostic data (see Telemetry and Diagnostic Data on page 7), and ensure that data are not overwritten as the result of a response action. This requirement only applies if the writing of diagnostic data is not affected by the original fault. Protection of critical science and engineering data. Fault responses must not destroy quotcritical dataquot stored on-board the spacecraft. quotCritical science and engineering dataquot must be defined by project policy. Requirements Interactions with Stored Sequences. The following interactions with on-board sequences may be necessary: Response design for critical events. Fault response is designed to ensure the completion of the critical event as and when required, with spacecraft safety having lower priority, until the critical events are completed. Orbit insertion is an example of a critical event. Response design for non-critical events. Unless required to execute a critical event, fault responses should stop any on-board sequence(s) only if the sequence(s) compromises the integrity of the fault response, or if the fault response compromises the integrity of the sequence. Reactivation of stored sequences. After completion of a response which terminates a non-critical stored sequence, fault responses should not autonomously resume the terminated sequence. Safing Requirements. quotSafingquot is defined as a general purpose fault response which results in the cancellation of non-critical sequences, the possible suspension of critical sequences, and a general reconfiguration of spacecraft components. Safing responses typically include the following general features: Uplink communications. The safing response provides for a spacecraft state and attitude that ensures uplink commandability in the long term. Downlink communications. The safing response provides for a spacecraft state and attitude that ensures continuous engineering telemetry with positive link margin. Environmental constraints. The safing response meets boresight and radiator environmental constraints. Safing priorities. When uplink, downlink, and hardware safing requirements are in conflict, the following priorities apply: Provide a safe state for the hardware, Provide an uplink, and Provide a downlink. Ultimately, uplink must be provided for in the long term. Benign spacecraft configuration. As a goal, safing responses should place the spacecraft in an operationally benign state. This includes but is not limited to the following: (1) powering off of all non-essential equipment including instruments, and (2) stopping of all non-essential spacecraft processes. Telemetry and Diagnostic Data Requirements. The spacecraft design should ensure that following an anomaly, spacecraft telemetry will be sufficient to perform the preliminary failure identification and analysis required for ground control to perform near-term corrective actions. At a minimum, the real-time telemetry stream includes the following: Measurements to unambiguously identify the current engineering subsystem configuration and operating status, Enable/disable states of fault protection software, and enable/disable states of fault protection dedicated hardware, Active/inactive states for fault protection software responses, Identification that a fault response has been activated, Monitor detection logic output (regardless of whether the monitor is enabled or disabled), and As appropriate, cumulative counters of faults detected. Telemetry design should ensure reasonable and timely sampling frequencies for these items. As a goal, the real-time telemetry stream should include monitor high water marks. A quothigh water markquot is defined as a measurement which identifies how close a monitor is to indicating a failure. Following an anomaly involving a fault protection activity, the spacecraft design should ensure that sufficient information is available to reconstruct the audit trail-- the sequence of fault protection events following the anomaly. Diagnostic data is also needed to analyze the anomaly and to identify the sequential effects of the anomaly on spacecraft performance. The data should be available in non-volatile telemetry or stored on-board for later retrieval by the ground system. At a minimum, diagnostic data should include unique identification and time-tagging of monitors and responses which have been active. It is also desirable that diagnostic data include the value of the measurement which initiated a response. Technical Rationale: JPL has incurred numerous instances of presumably redundant systems which failed to successfully transfer to the back-up path when the primary path did not function. A rigorous, systematic search, crosstrap FMECA, or sneak paths analysis could have foretold the failure, and redesign could have averted the problem. Prevention of propagating failures has its greatest value when supplemented by an on-board fault protection system. The practice of failure propagation prevention is of most value in a repairable system. Non-propagation minimizes the number of units requiring repair. In a non-fault protected spacecraft, this capability is limited to the preflight phases of either subsystem or system testing. In a fault protected spacecraft, it can be extended to the flight phase as well. The key to this investigation is a complete diagram of the involved interface circuits which penetrates each unit to a circuit depth sufficient to prove that no possible failures in one unit can propagate to become irreversible hardware failures in a second unit. Another input is a complete list of part or assembly failure modes for hypothesis. Successful transfer (or equivalently independence of the primary and back-up functions) is a necessity for either repairable or non-repairable systems and requires the same complete interface diagram and complete list of failure modes. Such a list must include items such as: Part failure modes (opens, shorts, stiction, etc.), Single event effects (latch-up, transfer, etc.), and EMI (latch-up, transfer, overvoltage). These last two items are critical since they can affect both sides of a redundant pair.

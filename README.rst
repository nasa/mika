**MIKA** (Manager for Intelligent Knowledge Access) is a toolkit intended to assist design-time risk analysis and safety assurance via advanced natural language processing capabilities. Emerging natural language processing techniques enable new ways to access safety-relevant knowledge available in text-based documents; however, limited tools exist that leverage state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities in a way that is accessible for new users, enables convenient application of multiple techniques, and is open source. Moreover, natural language processing for technical documentation often requires specialized techniques which are not always available in other toolkits. The MIKA toolkit fills this need by providing a variety of easy-to-use advanced NLP techniques centered around engineering documents.

Overview
====================================

Safety reports and other engineering documents contain a wealth of information from past projects and operations that could improve system safety and design, yet they are often under utilized. Advances in natural language processing techniques have improved information extraction and retrieval in consumer technology, biomedicine, and finance, for instance, but have not been applied to engineering documents on the same scale. To this end, the Manager for Intelligent Knowledge Access (MIKA) open-source toolkit has been developed for the following core capabilities:

1.	Enable rapid exploration of a set of text-based engineering text documents.
2.	Analyze large, unstructured datasets, or exploit structure in data when it is available (flexibility).
3.	Increase the value of engineering documents through adding metadata, analyses, and summaries. 

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MIKA includes two key capabilties for exploring text-based repositories which use BERT models as a backbone for multiple functions: 

- Knowledge Discovery (KD) enables the user to extract useful, meaningful information from text-based engineering documentation. This includes both supervised and unsupervised methods, such as:
    - a variety of topic modeling methods via the topic_model_plus class
    - custom named-entity recognition for FMEA extraction
    - the ability to analyze trends in hazards or failures using the trend_analysis module
- Information Retrieval (IR) enables the user to search a set of documents and obtain relevant documents or passages according to their query. This includes:
    - a default search class using a fine-tuned sentence-BERT model 
    - a custom information retrieval class that allows a user to fine-tune their own model

MIKA is considered research code and is under development to refine features, add new capabilities, and improve workflows. With this in mind, certain functions may change overtime. Please contact the contributors if any bugs or issues are present.

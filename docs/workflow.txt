 - Note: pass in domain stopwords when we call the processing function, pass in optional parameter

    - to perform preprocessing:
        -prepare data: print run time
        -preprocess data: include progress bar bc large data sets; print run time; include all parameters as optional so they are easy to change:
            -ngrams: min count, threshold, n-gram range; use of tp ngrams or custom ngrams
    - to perform topic modeling:
        -hlda or lda->calls % removal function: include progress bar bc large data sets, based on training;print run time:
            -params: % to be removed, min_cf, seed, level, eta, gamma, alpha, TW, training iterations and steps,
    - saving options:
        - save preprocessed data
        - save tm object .bin
        - save topics for each attr
        - save topic coherence
        - save taxonomy of varying levels
        - print run time
     - display options:
         -hlda tree display-graphviz required
         -ldaviz for lda objects
         -print run time
     - to run:
         -identify file name, columns, and document id column
         -create object
         -run prepare data
         -run process data
         -run topic modeling
         -run save
         -run display

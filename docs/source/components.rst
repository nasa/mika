MIKA
====

The MIKA package contains three core components for analyzing large sets of narrative text: ``mika.kd`` for 
knowldege discovery, ``mika.ir`` for information retrieval, and ``mika.utils`` for utilities. Typically,
a user will load and configure their data using ``mika.utils`` and then use a combination of functions
from ``mika.kd`` and ``mika.ir`` to perform an analysis.

Although the failure mechanism had no major impact on the Juno mission, it poses a risk that an engine may operate outside of its qualified mixture ratio, which could lead to mission loss. If full life testing is not feasible, the propulsion subsystem should ensure positive isolation of the propellant vapors throughout the mission. Also, assure sufficient downlink telemetry to ascertain the health and functionality of the propulsion subsystem.","In bi-propellant systems there is a risk that high oxidizer vapor content may create vapor FORP at the fuel check valve, resulting in a sticking propulsion check valve during an in-flight maneuver and anomalous engine operation, which could lead to loss of mission. The current method used by Juno and other spaceflight missions to limit propulsion system contact with propellant vapor to benign concentrations relies largely on quad-redundant check valves, and pyrolitic isolation valves in the oxidizer side. The Juno anomaly exemplifies the risk that high oxidizer vapor content may cause a sticking check valve during a maneuver that will result in the engine operating well outside of the qualified mixture ratio; this may lead to loss of the mission. However, the Juno mission is on track to achieve its mission objectives due largely to the availability of sufficient downlinked propulsion system health data to accurately characterize the system state.","Note that there are multiple candidate design measures for ensuring propellant vapors never meet, including: A propulsion subsystem design that uses separate pressurant tanks, similar to the Europa Clipper design. Use of check valves that prevent vapor back-flow. For example, such check calves were used successfully by the Cassini project, which employed a combination of latch valves and pyro valves like Juno, but the Cassini valves were no longer available for acquisition by the Juno project. Incorporate pyro valves in both propellant sides and reduce the time the tanks are not isolated. In designing spacecraft propulsion subsystems for long-duration missions: Adhere to JPL’s test-as-you-fly (TAYF) principle when flight-qualifying check valves. (That is, life testing would likely have detected the Juno oxidizer leak that led to either FORP build-up or excessive exposure of the check valve to oxidizer.) This recommendation may be very difficult to implement because it requires full mission-duration, high-fidelity testing lasting years. If TAYF is not feasible for a project, the propulsion subsystem should ensure positive isolation of the propellant vapors throughout the mission. This is in contrast to the current practice of seeking to limit the propellant vapor contact to benign concentrations, partly by means of pyrolitic isolation valves. Projects should continue to incorporate sufficient downlink telemetry to ascertain the health and functionality of the propulsion subsystem.",JPL,6/19/2018,"The successful 35-minute Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI) maneuver on July 4, 2016 allowed the planet Jupiter to capture the Juno spacecraft. The NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) then began preparing for the final major burn designed to change its orbit, with a period of 54 days, to its 14-day nominal operational science orbit. The final major burn to slow Juno and place the spacecraft in a tighter orbit around the planet (Figure 1) was planned as a period reduction maneuver (PRM), sometimes referred to for this mission as a Perijove Reduction Maneuver (although geometric perijove was not being changed by the maneuver). The PRM was intended as a regulated main engine burn in which both the fuel and oxidizer tank pressures are regulated during the burn by a helium pressurization system. This regulatory system is connected to the fuel and oxidizer tanks via passive check valves, and pyrolitic isolation valves in the oxidizer side (Figure 2). Figure 1. Juno’s orbital grid During preparations for the Juno PRM on October 13, 2016, telemetry on tank pressure readings revealed an anomaly during the pre-PRM tank pressurization activity (Reference (1)). A series of check valves between the helium tank and the fuel tanks remained closed for about four minutes after imposition of a positive pressure difference that should have immediately opened them. Further review of telemetry showed the oxidizer check valves had also malfunctioned in the same mode but to a lesser extent during the first few minutes of the prior burn-- the JOI maneuver performed in July. The telemetry further showed unexpected gas-side pressure increases suggestive of unintended upstream flow when the oxidizer tank pressure exceeded the gas-side pressure during the Deep Space Maneuver (DSM-2) performed 45 months earlier. Figure 2. A simplified Juno Propulsion Subsystem block diagram. Juno utilizes a weight-saving and redundant approach to spacecraft propulsion, with a bi-propellant main propulsion system and a monopropellant Reaction Control System. The main propulsion system uses hydrazine as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer. Lower than expected pressures in either the fuel or oxidizer tanks can result in unintended oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratios in the main engine during the burn, with potential effects ranging from under-performance (to nominal performance) to catastrophic failure. Hence, the “stuck-closed check valve” anomaly eventually led to a decision by the Juno project to forego the PRM altogether. The most likely cause for the pre-PRM fuel check valve anomaly was contamination, with the contaminant consisting of vapor fuel-oxidizer reaction products (FORP). The pre-JOI failure of the oxidizer check valve to immediately open is believed to be caused by excessive oxidizer exposure; but it could also be FORP contamination, with either possibility caused by an oxidizer leak failure that occurred in the previous maneuver (DSM-2). According to this scenario, the earlier oxidizer check valve leak failure (at DSM-2) produced excessive amounts of oxidizer in the gas side leading to: The oxidizer check valves sticking closed (at pre-JOI). The high oxidizer vapor content creating FORP at the fuel check valves. The FORP leading to the subsequent “stuck closed check valve” anomaly at pre-PRM. Because FORP contamination was a well–known failure mode during Juno design and development, multiple safeguards, such as quad-redundant check valves and oxidizer-side pyrolitic isolation valves, were employed. But these measures were obviously insufficient. While an anomaly resolution team determined that the fuel tank could be pressurized and a main engine burn executed in a blowdown mode to execute the PRM-- even in the presence of the anomalous check valves-- the project elected to avoid the risk of possibly attaining a less-than-desirable orbit and remain in the 53-day capture orbit for the remainder of the Juno mission. The higher-than-planned orbital period does not affect the quality of the science collected by Juno during each flyby because the altitude over Jupiter is the same at the time of closest approach. In terms of the total quantity of science return, it has recently been announced (Reference (3)) that the Juno mission will be extended three years until at least July 2021 so it can complete the additional 18 perijoves needed to finish mapping Jupiter. Another outcome of the longer orbit is that Juno will spend less time within Jupiter’s radiation belts on each orbit, reducing the accumulated radiation exposure of the spacecraft.

They are an unlikely hazard during other phases of aircraft operations because flying altitudes are typically higher than altitudes commonly used by birds. However, airborne atmospheric data collection may involve additional periods of low-altitude flight. Precautions to avoid bird strikes should be included in the flight plans whenever low-altitude data collection is being performed.","While bird strikes are most typical during landing and takeoff, sustained flight at low altitudes during airborne missions raises the likelihood of bird strikes at times other than takeoff and landing.","On aircraft missions with low altitude flight legs, the following actions are recommended: Bird hazard analysis data for the area to be used should be consulted before flights: Local airports may have data available to pilots for migratory season assessments USAF Avian Hazard Avoidance System (AHAS) website (http://www.usahas.com/) available for airfield and general risk review Nearby USAF airfields can tell pilot if they are in an elevated Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Phase II period (annual calendar periods of peak bird activity) Known migratory bird patterns may also indicate specific altitudes to avoid The aircraft recognition lights should be turned on for flight below 10,000 feet; The crew brief should include bird hazard threat management and Crew Resource Management (CRM) roles and responsibilities for visual look out; During periods of high workload, when visual lookout might be reduced, consider climbing to reduce bird strike risk; If a migratory season or a nearby USAF base is in BASH Phase II, avoid low-altitude flying, including takeoff/landing within +/- 1 hour from sunrise/sunset unless mission requirements dictate. If a bird strike has occurred or is suspected: Establish a climb away from the ground in order to safely assess aircraft systems, personnel injuries and controllability; Land as soon as practical and inspect the aircraft prior to continuing flight; and For windscreen strike, with two qualified pilots on board, consider visibility and injuries in determining who is the best pilot to land",LaRC,2/6/2017,"The Atmospheric Carbon and Transport (ACT)-America is an Earth Venture Suborbital mission that collects data in three regions across the eastern US, to better understand sources, sinks, and transport of carbon.

Recommendations include voltage clamping to counter the transient effects of sudden power removal.,"It is likely (Reference (4)) that the failure of the RapidScat payload on the ISS was due in part to unanticipated removal of power resulting in voltage spikes caused by possible system-generated or self- induced inductive kickback. The behavior of EMI filter components downstream of switches can pose a threat in the event of sudden power removal. The effect of long cable runs, such as those found in the ISS, must also be considered. Models of source impedances cannot always be counted on to genuinely represent behavior in off-nominal situations. Voltage clamping is a technique used to limit the amplitude of a transient across a circuit by clipping off the over-voltage spikes at a safe level. The behavior of an external power subsystem that is designed by an outside organization may not be as well understood by JPL instrument designers as the power subsystem in a JPL spacecraft. The RapidScat failure mechanism represents a credible vulnerability for JPL’s upcoming ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission.","Designs must be analyzed to understand if they contain the inductive potential to generate dangerous voltages when switch components open. Voltage clamping of the bus supply should be considered if it is practical and not precluded by competing requirements. Test as you fly, and fly as you test.",JPL,12/12/2017,"The RapidScat scatterometer was installed on the ISS in September 2014 to provide a replacement for the wide-swath scatterometry measurements that were lost when the antenna on the SeaWinds payload aboard the QuikSCAT satellite stopped rotating. Scatterometers are radar instruments that measure wind speed and direction over the ocean; they are useful for weather forecasting, hurricane monitoring, and observations of large-scale climate phenomena such as El Niño. Built by the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), RapidScat is mounted to the exterior of the ISS’s Columbus science laboratory module (Figure 1). Columbus was built and is operated by the European Space Agency. Figure 1. Illustration of the location of RapidScat on the ISS and its operation Station power is generated centrally by solar arrays and routed via a 120 VDC system to all Station users. Inside Columbus, the incoming power goes through two Power Distribution Units (PDUs) and then, as 120 VDC or 28 VDC, to all payload racks, external platform locations (e.g., RapidScat), center aisle standard utility panels, and subsystems. On August 19, 2016, the Columbus module experienced a shutdown of power to PDU-1, which supplied power to RapidScat and multiple other internal and external payloads and ISS systems (Reference (1)). Two minutes prior to the power bus shutdown, the RapidScat radar unexpectedly powered down and stopped sending telemetry. On August 20, an attempt to power RapidScat resulted in an overcurrent event. Subsequent attempts to power RapidScat all resulted in overcurrent events, and because the front-end power electronics are not on-orbit serviceable, the RapidScat mission could not be re-activated. The limited telemetry available suggests that RapidScat (Figure 2) responded to an under-voltage condition in the Columbus-supplied power by either shutting down or rebooting its computer. Approximately two minutes later, this Columbus PDU-1 power anomaly resulted in a sudden removal of power to RapidScat (and other payloads and hardware fed by the Columbus power system). Subsequent attempts to power the instrument resulted in over-current induced trips, suggesting that a substantial internal hard short developed directly across the power bus (Reference (2)). Figure 2. When QuikSCAT stopped collecting wide swath wind data in late 2009, JPL came up with a quick and cost-effective replacement that used the framework of the ISS and reused hardware originally built to test parts of QuikSCAT. Failure analysis performed to account for the observed telemetry and symptoms suggests that RapidScat may have been damaged by a combination of (1) the under-voltage condition and (2) inductive kickback when PDU-1 suddenly lost power. During instrument development at JPL, ground testing of a sudden power off scenario was not done with an inductive load attached. It is plausible that one or more field-effect transistors (FETs) were stressed or driven to short by inductive kickback during or after the PDU-1 sudden power off event (Reference (3)). Subsequent simulation of various failure modes revealed a heretofore undiscovered weakness in the design that left portions of the instrument’s solid-state switch circuits vulnerable to stress in the event of uncontrolled removal of power. It now seems most likely that the PDU-1 sudden loss of power event and a design weakness combined to cause the failure of a number of components in the power supply. The RapidScat mission did not have specific science requirements (although it accepted a set of science objectives consistent with a two-year mission). The primary RapidScat mission goal (which was essentially accomplished during its ~2 years of operation) was to demonstrate (1) the agile reuse of flight-worthy hardware and (2) the capability of a Class D-like project to deploy and host a science-class instrument.

To achieve correlation with the thermal model, a test was performed to characterize the solar flux level within the chamber as well as the chamber thermal gradients. This allowed for an improved correlation of the IA model; however, the additional time and resources required to perform the characterization test and complex model correlation were not ideal. For the Instrument Payload (IP) TVAC test, a heater plate system was designed, built and installed in the facility. This system, coupled with the chamber’s cold shroud, provided the necessary environments for the IP to reach its temperature targets without using the quartz lamps.","Quartz lamps supply radiant heat largely in the solar spectrum, but the distribution depends upon lamp setting which creates significant complications for model correlation. Correlating results with a thermal model may be easier and more successful by using heater plates rather than developing a thermal model to account for the necessary details of the lamp spectrum.","If it is desired to correlate thermal models to TVAC test data, it is best to avoid the use of quartz lamps.",LaRC,11/4/2016,"This lesson was learned during TVAC testing (Nov 2013 – February 2014) of the SAGE III on ISS IA and the subsequent model correlation effort. During the IA TVAC Test, quartz halogen lamps were used to achieve temperature settings within the LaRC 8’ x15’ TVAC chamber. The subsequent correlation of the thermal model was delayed because in the initial runs to correlate the model, many components were far hotter in test than in the model, even during the unpowered conditions. This led to the discovery that the quartz lamps in the 8’x15’ chamber produced a significant fraction of their output (70-90%) in the solar spectrum, rather than in the infrared (IR) spectrum as expected. Since the thermal model for this test setup had assumed only infrared (IR) radiation, correlation using the existing model was not feasible. Materials on the exterior of the SAGE III IA consist primarily of silver Teflon. The solar absorptivity of silver Teflon is less than its IR absorptivity by a factor of 16. In addition, the aluminum of the TVAC support tray had a relatively high solar absorptivity. These factors meant that the radiant heating within the chamber was radically different than in the thermal model. To accurately model the true behavior within the chamber, a different set of optical properties would be needed for each lamp setting; a higher lamp setting moves the peak of the spectrum farther into the solar range, and changes the material’s absorption of that flux. In addition, if the lamps are modeled explicitly, several different radiation cases must be run, one for each lamp bank, for each flux waveband fraction. Realistically, each radiation case with a different lamp setting should use different material optical properties. This is exceedingly difficult to do. In addition to requiring more model development time and more model uncertainty, the run times for the model will be four times longer since there will be more radiation runs necessary. Runs of transients would not be feasible, which substantially impacts the modeling capability. An uncorrelated thermal model would mean that thermal predictions for flight would be less accurate. To be able to correlate the IA thermal model to the testing that was performed, a characterization test was run in April 2014 (SAGE III-05-385-TR-001). This test allowed characterization of the solar flux level within the chamber and the chamber thermal gradients, which allowed improved correlation of the IA thermal model (SAGE III-THM-052). Due to the complexity and uncertainty involved in correlating thermal models to test data obtained while quartz lamps are operating, as well as the importance of the accuracy of the system-level IP model correlation, it was necessary to determine a way to complete Instrument Payload (IP) TVAC testing without using the lamps. A Ground Support Equipment (GSE) heater plate system was designed which allowed the IP temperature targets to be achieved with the use of the 8’ x 15’ chamber’s cold shroud and without using the quartz lamps. This heater plate system is described in SAGE III-10-137, and proved successful in allowing the IP temperature targets to be achieved while collecting data that was useful for model correlation. These heater plates continue to be used in the 8’ x 15’ chamber by other projects.",,SAGE III on ISS,,"Aeronautics Research, Human Exploration and Operations, Science, Space Technology",Public,Implementation » Phase C,,1/23/2017,"Test & Verification, Test Facility",use,

The modifications at the MPPF included the facility Gaseous Nitrogen (GN2) system. On August 16th, 2016 a pressurization test of the GN2 system was conducted. The intent of the test was to pressurize the new or modified parts of the GN2 system as part of Verification and Validation (V&V) but four panels that were part of the unmodified heritage portion of the GN2 system were also inadvertently pressurized. Had there been any disconnected lines or leaks in the tubing assemblies, this condition could have caused an oxygen deficient atmosphere within the interstitial walls of the facility and /or the high bay and airlock areas. Engineering, the Systems Engineers and the NASA Chief Engineers agreed to classify this event as a “Close Call”. The Close Call was caused by inadequate understanding of the actual configuration of the system under test and communication of this organization between the organizations involved in system design and testing.

Did you cross check with other documents/drawings and other organizations? Communication: Team communication is key to safety. All parties need to be instructed to come together immediately and discuss events whenever they are uncomfortable, or unsure of, moving forward.",KSC,8/16/2016,"During the course of GN2 V&V operations in the MPPF, personnel noted heritage panels labeled as “Gaseous Outlet Panels”. One such panel, located on the south wall had been previously opened and remained open enough to see inside, all of the gaseous lines were clearly capped/terminated, leading personnel to assume that all 6 of the similar GN2 panels shared the same configuration. After testing was initiated and facility GN2 pressure was applied, another cabinet was opened and it was observed to still have valves, regulators, gages, etc. installed for both the GN2 and Gaseous Helium (Ghe) systems and that pressure was present. Further investigation identified that 4 of the 6 heritage panels had valves, regulators, and gages rather than capped lines. Following discussions with GN2 Systems Engineers, Lead Design Engineers, Facility representatives, and Chief Engineers, the V&V work was halted until the panels could be more thoroughly evaluated and placed into a safe configuration. KSC utilizes different organizations to operate and maintain different types of systems (e.g. Information Technology systems, facilities and facility systems, or Ground Support Equipment). The GSDO Program also used various organizations to do facility modifications and Ground Support Equipment. The situation is also complex because of the mixture of unmodified heritage systems and new/modified systems. The MPPF facility GN2 system is partly unmodified heritage and partly new/modified. The drawings for the heritage part of the system were created and maintained by an organization different than that designing and implementing the new/modified part of the system.

The GSDO Program worked with several different organizations at KSC to design and build the systems, and the organizations had different processes for accomplishing these tasks. At the end of the design and implementation, the GSDO Program conducted acceptance/certification reviews according to a standardized process. There was a great deal of difficulty in getting some of these systems through the required acceptance/certification reviews because the organizations designing the systems had differing methods of handling requirements and differing expectations of what products were required to be produced with a design. The lessons learned can be summarized as follows: in cases where design and implementation is being done using different organizations by project teams with differing types of experience, it is necessary that agreements be in place at the start of a project that establish what design products, documentation and analyses are expected.","When using various organizations to design and implement systems with teams having varied project experience, establish clear expectations for products and documentation required from each project. Establish agreements with the review board for any reviews (e.g. certification or acceptance reviews) about which products are acceptable and which products may serve as replacements or equivalents to expected products.","Programs should assess the type of design experience of NASA organizations they propose to use for design tasks, evaluating their experience level and the type of designs they commonly perform in order to ensure experience with the type of design to be performed. Programs should list all products required during both the design and certification/acceptance phases of the projects, establishing acceptable alternative products and the review board for certification or acceptance reviews should sign up to any tailoring of products.",KSC,12/10/2014,"During the process of conducting acceptance/certification reviews for systems being designed and built for EFT-1, several systems were initially unable to meet criteria to complete these reviews. This resulted in schedule slips and unplanned expenditures in order to create missing products. There was also confusion by review boards about whether certain of the products produced were equivalent to required products. As a result of this, the GSDO Program took steps to ensure agreements were in place for each project covering which products/documentation/analyses were expected and which equivalent products were acceptable.",,GSDO Program,NPR 7123.1 NASA Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements,,Public,Not Specified,,8/25/2016,,use,"we can only use public lessons in the publication - okay to look at/consider now, but let's avoid them altogether to avoid mistakes"

The schedule and budget for verification and validation testing had significant overruns. Some of these overruns were due to issues affecting both the design and logistics organizations. Some of the lessons learned identified here are related to the schedule and budget overruns and some are related to things done well. The lessons learned can be summarized as follows: involve logistics early in the design, provide high quality design data to support their design analyses, eliminate late design changes, allow adequate time for long lead item procurement, and ensure that parts requiring modifications to be used in a system are modified prior to putting the parts into the logistics inventory.","Ensure that adequate spare parts are obtained during design and development to support the needs of Verification and Validation testing. Logistics Supportability Analyses need to be completed well before the start of Verification and Validation testing in order to allow adequate time for long-lead spares procurement. This requires early involvement of Logistics in the design process to identify potential long-lead spares and requires that late design changes be minimized. Requirements definition needs to be completed and requirements creep controlled to allow a timely end to design changes so that the logistics analyses can be finalized. The reuse of existing hardware in a new system needs to be coordinated with Logistics to identify any obsolescence issues in the reused hardware. Ensure that designs are completed, closed out and placed under configuration management with adequate time in the schedule to support both procurement of the system and procurement of spare parts. Late design changes must be thoroughly evaluated and this evaluation must include impacts to fabrication contracts and to procurement of long-lead items. In situations where spare parts are purchased for a system and the parts need to be modified to be used in the system, the modifications to the parts need to be completed prior to putting them into logistics inventory. This avoids situations where a spare part is pulled from logisticsinventory and the required modifications cause cost and schedule issues.","Modify existing design processes to ensure early Logistics involvement to eliminate (or minimize) major changes to the design late in the design process Ensure that projects properly budget for Verification and Validation spares as well as spares needed for special tests (e.g. EFT-1) Logistics processes must ensure that required special modifications to spare parts to be used in a system should be modified prior to placing them in logistics inventory. Otherwise necessary modifications to parts can cause budget and schedule issues when a spare part is needed right away. There are times when Logistics spares a “blank” part that may be modified for several different uses and in this case the cost and schedule implications of modifying a part need to be planned for. Ensure that in cases where existing (heritage) hardware is reused, the design process addresses the need for an evaluation of the maintainability of the reused hardware (obsolescence issues)",KSC,5/11/2015,"During Verification and Validation of the CMASS, there were delays due to lack of spare parts to support testing. Delays were also caused by parts being pulled from logistics inventory that had not been modified as required for use in the CMASS system.

Mounted in the Window Observational Research Facility (WORF) rack for use on the ISS, the ISERV payload consists of COTS optical equipment and an MSFC-developed Power Distribution Assembly (PDA). In addition to the use of COTS equipment, the ISERV payload is classified as Class D but is integrated into Class A (ISS) hardware, which implies that the payload must meet some Class A requirements not typically captured in Class D systems. Lessons learned in managing a small, time-constrained project with limited resources and an inexperienced team include need for foundational documents, need for flexibility in plans and procedures, importance of communication, and coordination of export control review. Pre-Phase A lessons included allowing ample vetting to assure correct assumptions, need for sufficient funding, and having a knowledgeable proposal team.","Foundational documents, critical for the initial planning and subsequent control of project activities, should be developed and widely distributed, published and advertised to the team early in the process. For projects limited in manpower and financial resources, these foundational documents will be equally limited in their complexity, but they should exist from the beginning of the project to provide guidance to the entire team. A clear flight certification process is needed for COTS hardware. Qualification requirements for all disciplines need to be clearly and explicitly stated up front. The approval process for changes can burden the flow of work with unnecessary steps if it is not tailored to the size, scope, and complexity of the project. Approval process for changes should be agreed to at the beginning of the project in line with configuration management for the size and scope of the project. Wise use of analyses and evaluation of interfaces at all stages of the life cycle can save time and resource expenditures during build, test, and milestone reviews. During any design, development, integration and test project that has a compressed schedule, it is essential for the team to communicate to avoid having the hardware wait for the next step in the process. Coordination is needed between MSFC and JSC Export Control offices. Seek out local (MSFC) help with database inputs before going to JSC for help. A payload with a normal schedule, would not have the issues with parts lists, Interface Control Document (ICD), manifest requests, and LRODS that we had on ISERV. Parallel development of the products is very difficult and fraught with potential mistakes. Check internally to see if another project, such as Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG), might have experience with the system/database. Using COTS equipment, while faster to procure, requires extra testing and communication to ensure it meets standards, which must be factored into the schedule. To meet implied requirements, minimum NASA standards must be met, which implies additional quality engineering support, specific test requirements, and part traceability. It is a good idea to get S&MA involved up front, even if only to understand the qualification requirements that may be encountered when the hardware needs to be integrated into the higher class system. If too many assumptions about the plug-and-play nature of the equipment and supporting hardware are made up front, the team will spend more hours reiterating design and testing activities. Assuming that COTS is faster and cheaper without understanding the implied requirements unnecessarily increases the risk of not meeting schedule, budget, and delivery agreements.","Provide the basic foundational documentation at the onset of the project. Some items that should be included are: - A simple Concept of Operations description, even in pictorial form. Reference to this ConOps will allow for the team to stay on the same page and make good decisions when issues arise. - A schedule, readily accessible to the entire team, updated twice a week during high-volume work periods such as testing. Schedule Developer will be best able to perform this by integrating into the team and following the work. This will relieve the rest of the team from the burden of reporting status. - A listing of all identifiable risks and at a minimum a skeleton of a mitigation strategy to be followed in the event that the risk turns into an issue. This will give all team members a basis upon which to make decisions and execute tasks more quickly while staying aligned with the agreed-upon process. The team should have a schedule and a designated scheduler. The schedule should be updated when information is available and during team meetings. Flexibility should be built into all plans and procedures, to allow for alternate paths when problems arise. Careful thought should be given to the necessary approval process for changes to agreed-upon plans to ensure that proper authorization is given without burdening the flow of work with unnecessary steps. Existing Organizational Work Instructions (OWI) should be reviewed and modified as appropriate to allow for the required flexibility. The ISERV team implemented a bi-weekly integration status meeting toward the end to meet pre-ship schedule. The meeting proved to be beneficial and kept the hardware in flow with little to no wait time because the team knew what to expect and when it was to occur. This could have been started a little earlier perhaps. Seek out local help with database inputs before going to JSC for help. Check internally to see if another project, such as MSG, might have experience with the system/database. Before management commits to a project like ISERV, there needs to be a thorough assessment of the job performed by Engineering along with the Project Office. The core engineering team that will be responsible for the project needs to be in place and a part of the development of a project proposal. Explicitly define and agree to the qualification requirements and processes up front, involving all stakeholders in the agreement negotiations at the start of the project. Get the requirements in writing. Have adequate funding with reserves for the project Establish a checklist or other guidance to define best practices for developing COTS-inclusive systems at the Center, where to find integrated system requirements, and how to identify risks introduced by using COTS equipment. Work processes tailored to dealing with configuration, information, and certification of COTS equipment should be put in place to assist projects in anticipating development, testing, and certification challenges.",MSFC,3/31/2012,"The ISERV payload was developed to provide data and images for the SERVIR team through a downlink from the ISS. Health and status information of the ISERV system was required through the downlink also. The ISERV payload has the capability for issuing commands at predetermined times and accepts file transfers from the WORF. Specific events and obstacles encountered during the design and development of the payload provide the basis of the lessons learned. They are: There were insufficient foundational documents for the ISERV payload due to cost and schedule constraints. The introduction of COTS components and systems into projects challenged the traditional MSFC approach to designing, developing and testing flight hardware. Standard operating procedures have evolved to meet Class A and B projects. The likelihood of more COTS-based or COTS-involved flight programs (Class D) being worked by MSFC Engineering is increasing and this new reality must be integrated into our defined ways of doing work. The procedures and tools are not the same for JSC and MSFC Export Control Offices. Inputs into the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) were required for payloads to be launched on HTV-3. The inputs were very specific and complicated. MSFC does not use this database at this time. The person coordinating this was not experienced with this process, but was able to get help from a Boeing person at JSC to walk her through. Added complications were that the manifest and Launch / Return / On-orbit Data Set (LRODS) were still being finalized when Export Control evaluation was needed, due to the shortened schedule and serial development of these products. The team was also dealing with holiday leave during December and early January, which limited the availability of personnel needed for review and approval. An MSFC Export Control Representative could not approve the inputs, so the team had to rely on the JSC Export Control Representative to approve the inputs. He didn’t understand why the approval request was coming to him, which further complicated the situation. The MSFC Export Control Representatives were instrumental in working with the JSC Export Control Representatives to resolve the difficulties and get the process moving in the right direction to closure. As the project was formulating, the MSFC ISS Payloads Office had little time to review and comment on the presentation to HQ and all the affected Engineering organizations were not consulted with in preparation for the HQ presentation. Areas where the presentations needed better coordination included: a. Adequate funding allocations for manpower, materials, and testing b. Better scope of the job to be done c. “Reasonableness” of the quote 5. Since the ISS Payload Office project and engineering teams were not included in the preliminary discussions with HQ on the proposal, the team had little knowledge of the system being proposed. In fact, due to space limitations in WORF (which is where the camera/telescope was to reside), the hardware selection had to be changed before the team was given approval to proceed. We had to do the best with what we were given.

The OCO-2 project found the inherited Orbiting Carbon Observatory design to be poorly documented. Assure that the spaceflight project retains the design knowledge needed to duplicate a system design. Train employees at all levels to recognize the value of project-generated knowledge and to champion its retention, sharing, and reuse.","Reflight of a system design is becoming a more common JPL practice. For example, the Mars 2020 mission concept under study by NASA would duplicate the successful design of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. (If the prospective Mars 2020 flight system is not designed as an exact copy of MSL, it would likely retain major MSL elements like the Descent Stage; Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) design; and Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG)). In addition, NASA is supporting the use of common spacecraft buses (e.g., LADEE, Cubesats) that will facilitate reflight of a standard flight system design. The JPL focus on primarily one-of-a-kind flight systems and missions may result in insufficient priority placed on design documentation and mission-centric knowledge retention. However, much technical knowledge gained over the course of a JPL project is reusable, and the actual reflight of a spacecraft design is not uncommon (e.g., Mars Polar Lander/Mars Phoenix, Jason-1/Jason-2/Jason-3, OCO/OCO-2, Mars Science Laboratory/proposed Mars 2020 mission). Even modest efforts to husband technical knowledge may reduce the cost of future projects, even ones that are not planned as build-to-print, by making the knowledge reusable.","Assure that the spaceflight project retains the design knowledge needed to duplicate a system design at an unspecified future time. Subcontracts should clearly specify the design documentation to be delivered by the subcontractor. Knowledge retention by the project should be verified by a process such as the (multi-stage) certification of flight readiness (COFR). Declare the capture and sharing of project and mission-related design knowledge, and retention for possible reuse, to be an objective of all spaceflight projects. Train employees at all levels to recognize the value of project-generated knowledge and to champion its retention, sharing, and reuse.",JPL,12/3/2013,"When NASA plans to refly existing system designs, it typically assumes that reuse of a tested or proven design will substantially reduce system development costs and mission risk. Following the 2009 launch vehicle failure of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO), NASA funded the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and fly an identical replacement spacecraft (OCO-2). Where the single instrument aboard OCO was designed by a contractor, OCO-2 was to be developed mostly by JPL. It became clear early in OCO-2 development, however, that key OCO design knowledge was not retained to the extent it might have been if JPL had possessed foreknowledge of an OCO-2 mission. First, the OCO project had not formally updated system drawings and processes to account for all the corrections (i.e., “redlines”). This necessitated a substantial effort by the OCO-2 project to locate the redlined information and correlate the redlines with each component. The project then had to decide whether to (1) build the corrections into the new hardware (or processes), or (2) duplicate the successive design iterations made by OCO. In duplicating the OCO processes, for example, OCO-2 added graphite to a component, and then removed it; then, because of incomplete incorporation of redlines, the project found additional places where the graphite needed to be removed. Second, the OCO design was poorly documented. The OCO contractor provided drawings to JPL in PDF format and without the redlines, and they had captured the design in disparate media (e.g., drawings, assembly and inspection data sheets, and test reports). In addition, much of the documentation (including proprietary data) had not been provided to JPL by the contractor, such as verification data at Level 3 and below. This incomplete documentation and transfer of design knowledge made it more difficult to accommodate required design changes (e.g., due to obsolescence or in response to failures on other missions) since the rationale for the original OCO design was not always manifest. As a result, JPL may have foregone some opportunities for risk reduction or cost reduction that might otherwise have followed from the reuse of a tested or proven design.","JPL has referenced this lesson learned as additional rationale and guidance supporting Paragraph 6.15.3.4 (“Engineering Practices: Configuration Management - Records and Reporting”) and Paragraph 6.17.5 (“Engineering Practices: Hardware Development”) in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory standard “Flight Project Practices, Rev. 10,” JPL DocID 58032, October 23, 2013.",Orbiting Carbon Observatory,"ASME Y14.1, Decimal Inch Drawing Sheet Size and Format ASME Y14.1M, Metric Drawing Sheet Size and Format ASME Y14.2, Line Conventions and Lettering ASME Y14.5-2009, Dimensioning and Tolerancing ASME Y14.13M, Mechanical Spring Representation, 1981 ASME Y14.24, Types and Applications of Engineering Drawings ASME Y14.34, Associated Lists ASME Y14.36, Surface Texture Symbols ASME Y14.38, Abbreviations and Acronyms for Use on Drawings and Related Documents ASME Y14.100, Engineering Drawing Practices","Aeronautics Research, Human Exploration and Operations, Science",Public,Implementation » Phase D,,4/29/2014,"Missions and Systems Requirements Definition, Program Management, Systems Engineering and Analysis, Flight Equipment, Hardware, Payloads, Spacecraft, Spacecraft and Spacecraft Instruments, Configuration control and data management, Configuration and data management, Engineering design and project processes and standards",use,

Project management should also require the Project Element Managers to collaborate in defining these needs.","Simulated science data is needed by multiple groups within a project team to test their respective SDPS elements. Even though the specific needs of each group may vary, a cooperative effort among the different groups may reduce the amount of time required to generate an adequately complete set of simulated data for system test.

Based on these brief documents, the project team can collectively determine how the members can most efficiently generate all of the requisite simulated datasets.",JPL,6/25/2013,"A Science Data Processing System (SDPS) is typically developed for a NASA project to accommodate the huge quantities of raw science data downlinked from instruments or experiments over the course of a mission. Sometimes referred to as a Science Data System (SDS), the SDPS converts telemetry into higher level science data products provided to the science community for research and applications. The SDPS is centered at the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on JPL-managed missions, where JPL is responsible for processing and distributing data products in a timely manner as required to meet mission objectives. Figure 1 depicts the science data flow to and from the science data processing function. One critical task in SDPS development is data simulation, a technique that provides visualizations of the extremely large and complicated science datasets and permits verification of the system. Figure 1. The science data processing function is depicted within the context of the entire Mission Operations System (MOS) for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory mission Legend: OSC– Orbital Sciences Corp; GSFC– NASA Goddard Space Flight Center The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO), an Earth orbiting satellite mission managed by JPL, was designed to make precise, time-dependent, global measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). In developing the SDPS for OCO, The Ground Data System (GDS) Team (which is responsible for spacecraft and instrument monitoring and operations) did a good job of leveraging the Instrument and Observatory thermal-vacuum test output to generate datasets for system testing (Reference (1)). The team generated multiple sets of data that represented varying conditions. These data provided a good basis for OCO system testing. Unfortunately, the GDS Team was unable to generate simulated data that covered all critical operational modes. The team only generated Attitude Control System (ACS) data for the Nadir mode, and was unable to generate ACS data in the Glint or Target modes. Further, the team was not able to generate data that could run through Level 2. The Instrument thermal-vacuum tests recorded only direct solar observations, rather than solar light reflected off the surface of the Earth. The science retrieval algorithms could not work with direct solar observations. It should be noted that, despite the best efforts of the team that plans and performs an SDPS test, it is not uncommon for the SDPS test configuration and environment to be unable to generate certain characters of test data. In such cases, certain simulated data sets are generated by the science instrument during system-level testing (e.g., thermal-vacuum test), while other types of simulated data are generated by an algorithm scientist and inserted into the processing chain to exercise and validate certain science data product software executables. The Algorithm Team generated a partial orbit of spectra that simulated the spectra that they expected to see in flight. The GDS obtained that dataset, manipulated it into an OCO L1B (registered radiance at the sensor product dataset) file, and gathered the ancillary data needed to run the dataset through the Level 2 AOPD (Agent-Oriented Program & Design algorithm) PGE (Product Generation Executive). Even at launch, however, that dataset had not yet been diffused into the system testing process. For OCO, the full set of required test cases was not identified soon enough to conduct the additional planning needed for their generation. For the OCO-2 follow-on project, the full set of simulated test cases was known, and the GDS Team began early to determine which sets should be implemented and which sets the project could omit as an acceptable risk.

Lessons were learned relative to the timing of the SIR within a project life cycle and the importance of tailoring the timing and review approach to the unique circumstances of the specific project.,"A broad range of practices exists for SIR timing as defined by NPR7123.1, NASA Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements. Implications of SIR placement within the project development flow must be fully assessed and understood by all stakeholders. The SIR timing and approach should be tailored for specific project risks considering, for example, spacecraft and observatory complexity and relative project experience. If necessary, consideration should be given to staging separate spacecraft (major components and systems coming together) and observatory (spacecraft and payloads coming together) integration readiness reviews. All tailoring must be well communicated across stakeholders and major review participants (e.g. Project, Standing Review Board, Program, Center Leadership).","Project and executing institution (NASA Center, Prime Contractor, etc.) experience, strengths, and weaknesses should be considered and factored into SIR timing in the project integration and test flow. If necessary, consider splitting the SIR scope into separate reviews to allow the necessary level of preparation and focus for a successful review. This may be especially appropriate in cases where the project and/or executing organization is believed to have weaknesses due to little recent relevant experience with the necessary level or type of integration and test required. Clearly communicate and document any review process tailoring.",MSFC,10/14/2012,"NASA Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements, NPR7123.1 defines the System Integration Review (SIR) as: “An SIR ensures that the system is ready to be integrated. Segments, components and subsystems are available and ready to be integrated into the system. Integration facilities, support personnel, and integration plans and procedures are ready for integration”. Logical options for SIR timing in a project’s integration and test flow range from as early as just prior to spacecraft subsystem integration (subsystems coming together to form the spacecraft) to as late as the beginning of observatory integration (instrument integration onto the fully integrated spacecraft). The LADEE SIR was placed early in the window, prior to the first spacecraft integration. The objective of this timing was to accomplish a thorough assessment of the project’s readiness for in-house assembly including procedures, processes, training and facilities. This timing was appropriate and necessary for the LADEE ARC team that was inexperienced at in-house spacecraft assembly and test. However, this placement created a very large scope for a single milestone review. The LADEE project did not pass the SIR in November 2012 due to a lack of demonstrated readiness for near term spacecraft integration activities as well as a lack of clear and executable plans for later observatory integration and testing. Following the unsuccessful November SIR, plans were emplaced to elevate key near term project integration readiness reviews, which would have otherwise been led by the project, to be chaired by the ARC Chief Engineer with participation from a subset of the Standing Review Board and other key stakeholders. These incremental detailed reviews enabled the project to proceed into spacecraft integration, preserving critical project schedule, but only after demonstrating that SIR identified deficiencies had been acceptably addressed. A fully successful delta-SIR was subsequently held in August 2012 prior to observatory integration. This approach, in effect, functioned as a staged SIR review process by breaking the scope of the review into smaller scope focused reviews that could be more easily prepared for by the LADEE project team.",,Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE),http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&amp;c=7123&amp;s=1A,"Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Implementation » Phase D,"NASA Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements, NPR7123.1",4/15/2013,"Integration and Testing, Hardware, Independent Verification and Validation, Logistics, Payloads, Policy & Planning, Program and Project Management, Launch Systems, Orbiting Vehicles, Robotics, Spacecraft and Spacecraft Instruments, Ground processing and manifesting, Lunar Operations, Review boards, Affect of Cultural factors on long-term human and robotic missions, Center distribution of programs and management activities, Communications between different offices and contractor personnel, Configuration and data management, Cross Agency coordination, Program level review processes, Early requirements and standards definition, Review systems and boards, Engineering design and project processes and standards",use,

Projects should be AMMOS quotcapability-driven,quot matching their MOS needs to the established AMMOS capabilities instead of vice versa.","The NASA engineering culture prizes MOS development plans that offer to maximize the performance achievable by ground and flight systems. Nevertheless, NASA projects have saved significant MOS development costs and mitigated risk by adapting existing AMMOS capabilities to the new mission, instead of developing a new MOS, to the maximum extent feasible. Rather than constraining innovation, the use of proven AMMOS capabilities may provide projects with more freedom to innovate because most of the risks have been mitigated by fixing anomalies on previous projects.","Spaceflight projects may derive significant benefits from being AMMOS “capability-driven,” matching their MOS needs to the established AMMOS capabilities instead of selecting only those AMMOS elements that precisely match mission needs. They should perform a review of the AMMOS system to determine which AMMOS software, tools, and services can be customized to match their mission characteristics, and which project MOS needs are unique and truly require new MOS development.",JPL,5/31/2012,"A Mission Operations System (MOS) is a ground-based control system that commands a spacecraft flight system and spacecraft/ground communications as needed to obtain mission science and programmatic data, while managing mission resources such as the Deep Space Network (DSN). An MOS is composed of hardware, software, people, processes, and facilities designed and implemented for a specific spaceflight mission. In the 1980s, the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed the Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System (AMMOS) that provides an MOS framework and functionality (Figure 1) that can be used for multiple deep space NASA missions by adapting it to the needs of different missions. With continuous AMMOS use from decade to decade, its MOS capabilities have continued to expand to meet the needs of new missions (see Figure 2). Figure 1. Typical decomposition of an MOS into functional elements, tools, and services, indicating elements that can be provided from the AMMOS. The desire by projects to maximize spacecraft and instrument capabilities may tempt them to develop unique MOS hardware and software instead of maximizing the use of AMMOS resources. However, use of a multi-mission MOS (MMOS) like AMMOS offers the opportunity for reduced development and operations costs. Almost all deep space (and some Earth orbital) missions make use of AMMOS tools and services (Figure 2) maintained by the JPL Multimission Ground Systems and Services Office (MGSS), although the extent of use varies. Table 1 illustrates the percentage of AMMOS software that was used by several JPL projects in developing their Ground Data System (GDS), the software and hardware elements of the MOS. Only 68 percent of Mars Exploration Rover's (MER's) GDS software was obtained from AMMOS because MER had unique rover surface navigation and control needs. In contrast, Dawn is a recent project with a non-planetary mission that was able to take advantage of increasing AMMOS maturity to make extensive use of it. In addition to the software development cost savings, an AMMOS-derived GDS may feature lower recurring operations costs and risk because many anomalies that would have occurred during flight operations have already been fixed and because personnel have gained prior experience using the system. AMMOS use also promises a shorter development cycle because AMMOS adaptation takes less time than development of a unique MOS. Figure 2. List of current MGSS customers (Reference (1)). The yellow highlighted projects are JPL-managed. For heavy AMMOS users, much of the project’s MOS development cost may involve the cost of customizing AMMOS capabilities: it is mostly AMMOS hardware and software that needs to be customized by a project. The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) project was able to customize a GDS by adapting AMMOS software at minimal cost, whereas developing a unique GDS instead would have required development of up to 10 million source lines of new code (MSLOC) at a cost of at least ten-fold. Even with the maximum use of AMMOS capabilities, however, projects still need to develop some project-specific MOS elements or tools. For example, it would not be practical for AMMOS to supply instrument-specific science data analysis software because it would have to be so heavily customized to meet the needs of the particular instrument. The recent GRAIL (Reference (2)), Stardust/NExT (New Exploration of Comet Tempel 1) (Reference (3)), and EPOXI (Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact Extended Investigation) projects were very successful in containing MOS development costs and experienced few performance problems during the mission because they tailored their MOS needs to the established AMMOS capabilities. Despite the cost, schedule, and risk mitigation benefits, adapting an MOS to a project presents some challenges. AMMOS must provide mission operations engineering tools and services that can support a wide and increasing range of deep space mission types (e.g., orbiters, landers, rovers, penetrators, balloons). Reference (4) provides an example of the complexity of the operations and science data return planning process for a Mars rover. Novel hardware on a spacecraft may necessitate operating software, tools, and processes that are not in the AMMOS inventory. However, the present AMMOS bears little resemblance to the AMMOS of the 1980s: with each additional spaceflight project it has served, AMMOS capabilities have expanded to allow a new project to select more AMMOS elements for adaptation to their MOS. Without AMMOS, it would cost NASA approximately an additional $300M over 10 years to design and implement an MOS for each project. References: Terry D.

The functional owner of PP&C resources at the NASA Center must ensure that PP&C personnel acquire a knowledge base and skill level commensurate with implementation of EVM.

The NASA EVM Capability Project was established by the NASA Office of Chief Engineer (OCE) to develop and pilot an agency-wide, in-house, EVM capability that will meet NASA's project management requirements and ensure compliance with the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandates. The NASA Program Management Council (PMC) approved the NASA EVM Capability Project on December 16, 2009. There are three primary objectives of the EVM project: Establish a NASA EVM process, along with the supporting documentation, that can be used as a model for all NASA projects that must implement EVM. Demonstrate the NASA-wide EVM capability process on two projects-- (1) the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems Project and (2) the Ice, Clouds, and Land Elevation Satellite II (ICESat-2) Project. The purpose of these two EVM pilot exercises is to test and modify the process as needed to ensure the most effective implementation of a NASA-wide EVM capability. Sponsored by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) and managed by NASA Johnson Space Center, the EVA Systems Project seeks to protect humans while operating outside the pressurized spacecraft environment and while exploring other planetary bodies. Sponsored by the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and managed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, ICESat-2 is the second generation of the orbiting laser altimeter ICESat scheduled for launch in early 2016. Enhance NASA management insight into project performance by employing an effective EVM capability. The EVM pilot team's ability to fully implement EVM on the two projects was constrained by the Project Offices' limited knowledge and understanding of EVM systems and practices (Reference (2)). Although this impediment was not entirely unexpected, it impacted the pilot exercises at an early stage when project management decisions most impacted EVM implementation. This experience with the pilot exercises suggests that EVM knowledge and experience on the part of NASA programs and projects will range vastly from novice to expert. Because a NASA project's organization is newly minted for the purpose of formulating and implementing a spaceflight mission, it lacks the mature management systems commonly found in long-standing organizations. Establishing and maintaining capabilities such as an interface between the automated EVM analysis tool and the project's management system(s) for exchange of up-to-date data may stretch project resources (Reference (3)). Struggling to respond to stakeholder demands while trying to execute tasks consistently, and lacking mature systems for management functions like task authorization and scheduling, EVM may be far too advanced a concept for the project to readily embrace. In contrast, the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which is under contract to implement EVM, has set up an EVM organizational framework that includes the necessary people, processes, and technology/tools. For example, the Juno project, which completed Phase D in 2011, planned their work and reported their performance in accordance with JPL's validated EVM System Description and toolset (Reference (4)). In 2004, the Stardust project manager attributed his success in effectively managing project reserves to assiduously tracking earned value against cost-to-complete (Reference 5). Newly formed projects typically look to previous projects at the NASA Center to provide templates for project plans, reports, etc., rather than preparing them from scratch, but these inherited Center models are likely to be similarly incompatible with EVM. Lack of adequate project preparedness to implement EVM systems may be remedied by the promulgation of a NASA framework that meets EVM requirements. Adoption of an Agency-wide approach may provide the project with an existing EVM-compatible management architecture, including spreadsheet and report templates, instead of wholly creating one.

The inclusion of infrared motion capture analysis with the physical mockups improved the human factors analysis and also helped to facilitate development of detailed work instructions and improve training materials. Analyses were accomplished by first developing a timeline of events that included each activity, and then each activity was analyzed by operability and human factors experts with spacecraft processing experience. A human factors analysis tool was adapted for this activity. Several human factors and operations experts were brought together in a small team to perform this analysis. Following each issue discovered during the analysis, the necessary analysis design engineers were brought into the process to address the issue for design improvements.","Physical mockups were a great way to analyze and verify the ground processing requirements for flight hardware and to validate the ground activities. Physical mockups can also be used for training and developing detailed work instructions and training tools. Video and infrared motion capture can improve the proactive training materials so that while designs are being evaluated and improved, knowledge gained and files collected from the same motion capture effort can be used to develop training and work instructions. The NASA CxP program-level human factors requirements document Human-Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) greatly promoted better human factors systems engineering and integration. This improved the integration between ground systems and crewed vehicle designs for ground processing. Early collaboration and planning between the flight and ground hardware designers for the human factors operability engineering analysis (HFEA) is necessary. Timeline analysis is a great way to analyze and improve the design of ground and flight hardware interfaces for ground processing of the ground equipment, as well as the flight and ground hardware interface. Although the Human Factors Operability Engineering Analysis (HFOEA) was primarily applied to Orion and ground systems to improve the design of hardware for better human factors and operations, some areas of HFOEA can be used to improve the work operations documents and processes, e.g., for hazard warning signs being called out in the work steps.","Employ qualified human factors person/s on teams from the beginning of the project. Promote more standardized and integrated mockup processes and designs across the Agency. Share mockups across Centers, projects and commercial partners. Embed mockup analysis as part of the engineering processes as one option for the appropriate HFEA. Future mockups should also include more collaboration with the GSE. Continue applying these processes and collaborations to future NASA missions, specifically the timeline option to the Human Factors Engineering Analysis Tool (HFEAT), where applicable. Embed HFEA and HFOEA as part of the engineering processes as a decision tool to choose from for the appropriate human factors engineering analysis. Continue using the design visualization process, where operations personnel meet with the design visualization personnel in the design visualization lab to review the flight and GSE designs for human factors. These important meetings with the operations personnel and design engineers using the actual flight and ground designs loaded into the design visualization tools were a great help. Introduce motion capture analysis into applicable activities during the human factors operability engineering timeline analysis, especially where a worksite analysis is needed, or where two or more projects interface, e.g., Ares/Orion/GO. Motion capture allows for quicker, simpler, real-to-life simulations, and the computer models include the computer-aided design (CAD) flight hardware and human Avatar, in which the envelope spaces between the human and flight hardware can be viewed, and the stresses to the human can be computed. Promote more HFEOA timeline analyses with the ground support equipment, such as the flight and ground interface at the umbilical plates and the ground commodity connections to flight hardware. Use the design problems and solutions from this HFEOA effort to improve the NASA-STD-3001, NASA Space Flight Human System Standard – Volume 1: Crew Health and Volume 2: Human Factors, Habitability, and Environmental Health., to promote better NASA human factors systems engineering and integration in future programs.

IW2's personal fall protection lanyard was connected directly to a steel ladder climbing device cable attached to the ladder. Earlier that morning, another ironworker (IW3) decided the knot securing the lifeline to the ladder rung was insufficient, and added an additional half-hitch to the two existing knots. (It was undetermined whether the additional half-hitch prevented the knot from untying). As IW2 transitioned from the platform to the ladder, IW2's right hand became entangled in tethers attached to the fall protection harness preventing a firm grasp of the ladder rung. IW2's left hand was not yet in contact with the ladder but IW2 continued in motion away from the platform to the ladder. IW2 fell and impacted IW1 who was standing on the small door access platform approximately 12 feet below. As IW2 fell, IW1 alerted by the commotion, looked up, stepped forward and raised his arms. IW2 struck IW1 in the chest, knocking IW1 off the platform and beam. IW1's knee was injured in the impact with IW2, and IW2 sustained injuries as a result of impacting the fixed structure including the platform, which was where IW2 came to rest. IW1's fall was arrested by personal fall protection equipment, and IW1 was suspended 450+ feet above the VAB floor.",,,,,Public,Not Applicable,"<a href=""http://sma.ksc.nasa.gov/kscsafety/KSCSafetyMishaps.html"">

The Orbiter Maintenance and Requirements Specification Document (OMRSD) requires that this redundancy be verified as part of the Orbiter processing flow. A special test must be run to verify the redundancy by manually dropping the electrical power busses. This test cannot be run at the same time as other activities and affects the turnaround flow for the Orbiter. New space vehicles should have this critical LRU redundancy verification built in so that verification of bus redundancy is automatic every time power is applied to the spacecraft.","Providing redundant power to critical LRUs is important to the Orbiter’s redundancy management system. However, the need to manually drop busses affects the serial turnaround flow since no other testing can take place when the power has been dropped. Ideally, the equipment’s redundant power should be verified automatically upon power-on. Because the Orbiter does not have this capability, special bus drop tests must be run to verify the bus redundancy.","For any new space vehicle program, where redundant power is provided to the space vehicle’s critical LRUs, the capability to automatically detect and verify the bus redundancy should be designed into the system. A system similar to the Orbiter’s “Caution and Warning” panel could be used to monitor the bus redundancy status of all critical functions.

This allows the LRU to continue to function if one of the Orbiter’s electrical power busses goes down. Separate and redundant busses are wired into the LRU, where internal “either/or” circuitry allows the LRU to continue functioning when a bus fails. The OMRSD requires verification of this redundancy as part of the processing flow. This verification drives the performance of serial Orbiter Maintenance Instructions (OMIs) to manually drop the busses and verify that the critical LRUs continue to operate on redundant power. OMIs such as OMI V1161 are serial in the test flow because no other testing can take place while the busses are manually dropped. Mission visibility of critical LRU bus redundancy is extremely limited. There is no health status indication that a particular LRU has the required bus redundancy.

All hardware, whether Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) or prototype, used in proximity of a space vehicle require the performance of all design, operation, and training verification procedures.","The IDC was not designed or fabricated in accordance with the following NASA design requirements: NSTS 07700, Volume X; SW-E-0002; KSC-STD-E-0002E; and KSC-E-165E. The IDC purge components were not designed to prevent overpressurization, which caused system failure. Instead of a Bepco enclosure pressure control valve, a Bepco control panel rapid-exchange valve was used to control GN2 system purge. This allowed the rapid release of overpressure, which in turn caused the system to fail. The IDC single-stage regulator was found to have vibrated open, causing the inlet pressure to increase (creep) to 50 psi. The nominal operational pressure setting is 10 psi. This increase in the inlet pressure setting allowed the system to become overpressurized and caused the system to fail. The IDC camera head enclosure lid was not sealed properly because of ground wire interference, which caused a differential in system pressure between enclosures. The bottom clip on the IDC camera battery, power supply, and power supply enclosure were seated but did not catch the enclosure door, which contributed to system purge leakage. NASA lab personnel completed measurement testing before the ICD was put into operational use. However, purge system operation and functional checkout were not performed, which prevented detection of system overpressurization before operational use. The current operational procedure, MDA Prototype Ice Detection Camera User Manual Rev 4.0, was not followed. Use of that operational procedure might have prevented the system overpressurization. A new local procedure for field use will be developed containing all operational steps, notes, cautions, and warnings. The procedure will include a section requiring that such equipment undergo purge and functional checkout in a NASA lab before use in the field. All operators will be trained on the use of the new procedure and the IDC. At the time of this close call, KSC did not have a process to certify prototype equipment used on the Center.","Valves that do not perform a NASA-required valve function should be physically disabled. Valves that do not perform a NASA-required valve function should not be incorporated into larger designs and should not be included in procurement specifications. KSC project teams should review procurement specifications for prototypes more closely to ensure that KSC requirements, including those for hazardproofing and electrical design, are part of the procurement specification. Engineering Review Boards reviewing requests to use prototypes should assign a single, dedicated point of contact to be responsible for verifying the prototype's compliance with design requirements (mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, reliability, etc.) for use at KSC and to request any warranted waivers. A formal approved procedure should be in place for the operation of a prototype after design verification. An approved user training course should be in place for prototype operation procedures after design verification.

The operator, a NASA FIT engineer, started to configure, pressurize, and power up the MacDonald, Detwiller, and Associates (MDA) Prototype Ice Detection Camera (IDC). Figure 1: Overall IDC Configuration The operator reported that the initial GN2 supply cylinder pressure reading was 2,900 psi. He then turned the IDC single-stage regulator gauge valve and observed a pressure increase to 10 psi (the nominal operational pressure setting). After adjusting the IDC rapid-exchange valve and completing the power-up sequence, he observed an immediate loss of system pressure, with the GN2 supply cylinder and pressure regulator reading 0 psi. He then turned off the electrical power, closed the GN2 supply cylinder valve, and proceeded to the pad surface to retrieve a spare GN2 cylinder. When he returned, he moved the IDC outside the west elevator at the Fixed Surface Structure (FSS) 95' level and secured the spare GN2 bottle. But because the FIT was preparing to move to the 255' level, he did not complete the gas and pneumatic connections. Upon arrival at the 255' level, the operator rolled the IDC from the elevator to the southwest corner, where he connected the GN2 gas bottle. While making the connection, he looked at the single-stage regulator gauge but did not touch or adjust it. He opened the GN2 supply cylinder valve slightly and then heard what he described as a “loud whine and a pop.” The panel glass had shattered (see figure 2).

The NASA and contractor test team members did not seek an outside, independent review of a test that was clearly beyond their expertise and experience. An independent review by other disciplines would have likely pointed out important aspects to consider and overcome the group-think and schedule pressure that were factors in many of the decisions made. This mishap would have been avoided had procedures/requirements been followed.

Most of these issues appear relevant today. The workshop summary reports suggest ""corrective strategies"" for coping with ""common thread"" issues that arise on project after project.","There exist overriding ""common thread"" engineering issues that are evident in flight project after flight project, but techniques for coping with recurring constraints to mission success are not always communicated to the next generation of PMs. Most of these common threads may not be unique to JPL, but they are all significant to JPL because they are central to its engineering culture.","Each summary report provides ""corrective strategies"" for coping with specific common thread issues. (There is a 1990s-era emphasis on coping with ""Faster-Better-Cheaper"" constraints, particularly in Reference (2), but many of these constraints apply to today's cost-constrained missions.) In addition, the reports provide a set of overall recommendations specific to the general categories of common threads: Communications. Work on communications at all levels -- i.e., within the project; between the project and such support organizations as product assurance and safety; as well as with the contractor, subcontractor, and fabrication and assembly personnel. Projects must take advantage of lessons learned and other knowledge that already exists at the Laboratory, though it may require crossing an organizational boundary. Interfaces. Beware of interfaces of all kinds -- hardware to hardware; hardware to test and ground support equipment (GSE); spacecraft to launch vehicle; and people to people. Be especially careful when a system is designed by one group and used by another. Heritage. Evaluate inherited hardware as thoroughly as new hardware. There is a tendency to put too much trust in inherited hardware. Several examples were presented in which the new spacecraft application presented life or environmental challenges not faced in the original application, and the inherited device failed. Parts. Semiconductor parts are getting more reliable, but NASA and DoD programs have less control than they once did. It is becoming harder to get radiation-hardened parts, and this presents new challenges such as providing Single Event Effect (SEE) tolerance at the system level. Work with the Parts organization early to prevent delays on long lead items. Programmatic. There is ""sales"" pressure for projects to provide extraordinary levels of science and mission complexity while staying within severely constrained schedules and budgets, and upper management must be made fully aware of any increased risk. Monitor the fundamental program assumptions, and replan when fundamental assumptions change. Ensure that project reviews are thorough: the major benefit of design reviews is the time spent preparing for them. ATLO and Launch Site Issues. The workshop consensus on the correct amount of time in ATLO was somewhere between twelve and eighteen months, depending on how well people, parts and processes are understood. The new projects wish ATLO (i.e., Integration & Test) to be flexible enough to add new tests as the knowledge of the hardware increases. Provide time and budget contingencies in ATLO to deal with the unexpected. Ensure that written, well rehearsed, procedures are available before shipping hardware to the Cape. Product Assurance. There is a strong relationship between adequate product assurance and successful programs. The PMs favored continuation of the practice of having Mission Assurance (especially Reliability Engineering) personnel collocated with flight project personnel.",JPL,12/29/2010,"JPL held a Common Threads Workshop in May 1996 and again in July 1997 as a venue for seasoned flight project managers (PMs) to convey some key knowledge to the next generation of PMs. The premise in organizing the workshops was that ""common threads"" exist that are evident in project after project, in the form of similar flight and test failures or failure mechanisms, programmatic issues, and sometimes serious oversights. These problems are well understood and often solved in some innovative way on one project or program, but the knowledge is frequently not passed to another project with a similar problem. Thirteen years after the publication of the workshop reports (References (1) and (2)), most of these overriding engineering issues still appear relevant. The workshop presentations consisted of experienced PMs and other JPL engineering leaders describing issues and coping techniques that arose during their program/project stewardship that gave them a deeper understanding of constraints to mission success. The format of each presentation was either ""war stories"" specific to a project or ""lessons learned"" from general experience. The 1996 workshop involved mostly PMs focusing on programmatic issues, while the 1997 workshop involved more Engineering and Science Directorate personnel focusing on design issues. The common threads mutual to both workshops fell into the following 8 general categories: Communications issues at all levels Hardware interfaces Contractual interfaces Heritage and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) issues Parts issues Programmatic issues Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations (ATLO) and launch site issues Product assurance issues Within these groupings, there was a high level of agreement between presenters on specific common threads, such as: ""Failure to convey 'lessons learned' from one project to the next and to all project elements, including the contractor and subcontractors"" (a ""Communications"" common thread). ""Placing too much trust in inherited hardware"" (a ""Heritage/COTS"" common thread). ""Determining the proper amount of burn-in time"" (a ""Parts"" common thread). ""Growth in science requirements that jeopardize the mission"" (a ""Programmatic"" common thread). ""Failure to consider the differences in the test environment and the flight environment"" (an ""ATLO"" common thread, often stated as ""Test as you fly""). References: Arthur F. Brown and John E.

Faster, more accurate processing and documentation can be achieved by applying a unique and intelligent bar-code label to each part, and tracking the parts in a central database. Travelers/part tags can be machine-printed and attached to parts so they can be tracked as they are removed, inspected, stored, recalled, and reinstalled.","The discrepancies noted during return-to-flight processing included difficulty in producing a legible ID with rubber stamps and ink; illegible part/serial/order control numbers; human error in reading part/serial/order control numbers whether legible or not; and human error in transcribing part/serial/order control numbers onto paperwork. Other problems were noted, including time-consuming efforts in inventory control and reporting functions; mundane repetitive accountability procedures; the need for more stringent requirements for accuracy and quality control; and problems with configuration control and documentation control. The lesson learned from this experience was that entering data by visual observation and handwritten entries produced numerous errors; but by bar-coding parts, a database can be built and used for easy processing of thousands of parts. Travelers can be printed with preloaded information from the database in lieu of making visual observations and hand entries. Some advantages gained from bar coding and tracking were; Reduced cost (fewer installation mistakes per configuration and fewer installation man-hours) Improved accountability of hardware from removal through installation during processing (better logistic accountability and elimination of delays for configuration verification) Improved installation of parts (for multiple items) by bar-coding the part and its location with the same bar code number Improved efficiency – rather than being retrieved from a random handwritten log, with the Parts To Go function, parts can be retrieved from a sorted list (arranged by vehicle zone, installation drawing, or any manner the technician might choose) Reduced need for paperwork to correct configuration discrepancies (errors in entering, reading, or transcribing part/serial/order control numbers) Reduced human error (in installation, reading ID labels, location, storage, and typographical errors) Use of common software to support both the TCS tracking system and Carrier Panel Tracking System.","Future systems would benefit from adopting this same approach to processing.

During this time, the misreading of part IDs resulted in numerous problem reports, time-consuming paperwork, and lost man-hours to correct the discrepancies. This occurred in 10 to 20 percent of all TCS removals. To deal with this problem, in 1989 the TCS tracking system was put into use under the Shuttle Processing Data Management System II (SPDMS2). It was enhanced in 1992 to support the first Orbiter Maintenance Downtime Period (OMDP) for the Shuttle Orbiter Discovery (OV-103) at KSC and reduced processing rates to 33 TCS blankets in 15 minutes, with a program savings estimated at $90K per flow. In 2006, a conversion from the LSOC1 program to Oracle brought many more enhanced features. This upgrade was a catalyst for improving the tracking and status features of other systems, such as the Carrier Panel Tracking System. This single program greatly enhanced processing of over 35,000 parts in the TCS inventory, both in the vehicles and in Logistics. The bar coding of parts and their locations prior to removal saves time and money and is a user-friendly system for shop employees, planner/schedulers, and managers.","Under the new TCS tracking system, the Configuration Discrepancy Report count became zero for misread or incorrectly documented part/serial/order control numbers.

There seems to have been a lack of appreciation of this fact within the space launch vehicle design community in the past, and specifically from the performance-oriented design disciplines. There is a need to define the operational implications of top-level design choices on operationally driven Figures of Merit (FOM) in the conceptual or Pre-Phase A/Phase A stage of design. At this critical stage, top-level parameters are being traded against each other in order to achieve an initial converged (and possibly optimized) design point. By doing this, it may be possible to incorporate considerations from lessons learned from operational experience into future designs. Specific Design for Operations approaches for future reusable launch systems are included in the attached paper.","Processing requirements that increased the cost of the Space Shuttle Program can be directly traced to the selection of subsystems in the architecture. Because choices were made without sufficient consideration given to how a particular design approach could improve the operability of the launch system, the optimistic predictions for the Shuttle’s flight rate and processing requirements did not materialize.","To improve the operability of any new space vehicle, the architecture should be designed from the outset to be more efficient.

This unexpectedly caused the sunshade to drop below the allowable flight temperature, where thermal stress could damage the structure. Due to budget pressures, the instrument contractor had failed to update the integrated spacecraft thermal model to reflect changes to the thermal blanket design. Systems with a complex thermal design, like HiRISE, require an accurate and up-to-date thermal model.","The in-flight thermal performance of systems with a complex thermal design, like HiRISE, is difficult to predict and requires an accurate and up-to-date thermal model. Had the thermal model been updated, the ramifications of the blanket design change would have been recognized.",Prepare and use the most up-to-date integrated spacecraft thermal model whenever possible.,JPL,3/29/2010,"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) was launched in August 2005 with a mission to study the Martian climate, identify water-related landforms and aqueous deposits, characterize potential landing sites for Mars landers, and provide UHF relay for science data produced by these future missions. One of 6 science instruments on MRO, the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera, is designed to image the Martian surface at up to five times the resolution previously available. Three months after launch, a spacecraft thruster calibration activity placed the spacecraft in an attitude that caused the temperature of the HiRISE sunshade (Figures 1 and 2) to unexpectedly drop to -136 degrees C (References (1) and (2)). This exceeded its lower temperature limit of -110 degrees C. established during qualification test. Because this attitude blocks data downlink to Earth, mission controllers did not detect this anomalous condition until the calibration activity was complete and the sunshade had returned to its nominal temperature. The resulting thermal stress raised the concern of potential structural damage to the sunshade during this temperature excursion. ............. Figure 1. Diagram of HiRISE configuration Figure 2. Sunshade configuration is depicted in photo of HIRISE under construction Initial thermal analysis had predicted in-flight temperatures well within the allowable flight temperature (AFT), and the in-flight thermal performance to date had been consistent with the original thermal model. However, an investigation of the temperature excursion anomaly found that the validity of the spacecraft thermal model was compromised by two factors: Although the sunshade is always exposed to the sun during nominal operations, it was shaded during the thruster calibration activity. One of the materials in the multi-layer insulation (MLI) thermal blanket had a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that was high enough for the shaded blanket to contract and contact the underlying sunshade, forming an unanticipated thermal short. Design changes had been made to the thermal blanket, but due to budget pressures the HiRISE contractor did not update the integrated spacecraft thermal model to reflect the as-built thermal blanket. Because the behavior when shaded was unexpected, and because the sunshade is always exposed to the sun during nominal operations, updating the blanket model was not considered a high priority. When the contractor subsequently updated the thermal model and ran it against the thruster calibration sequence, the results were in close agreement (within 1 degree C) with the flight actuals. A structural analysis indicated a positive stress margin for the sunshade during the event; the absence of sunshade damage is also supported by instrument telemetry and image quality that show no signs of degradation in instrument performance or thermal properties. Future maneuvers have been modified as necessary to minimize sunshade shading.

The van was parked adjacent to the receiving dock at the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). After the crate was moved to the rear of the vehicle for unloading, the van driver/operator manipulated the incorrect control on the powered lift gate (Reference (1)). (Figure 1 illustrates the lift gate control system's susceptibility to operator error.) This caused the lift gate to tilt instead of lower. The crate rolled off the lift gate and struck the ground, damaging the hinges and breaking off the lid. Only the crate directly contacted the ground, and the EGSE rack with its 2-inch thick foam padding remained secure within the crate. The shipping crate had four casters, but the locks on the two downhill casters were unlocked during the operation. Figure 1. Lift gate control panel on the truck that was unloading Aquarius EGSE. The diagram below the image shows that the control panel is not well designed to deter operator error. (The yellow label indicates that the dial on the right is a “Slider” control that positions the gate horizontally.) The EGSE rack was being removed from the vehicle because it had not been approved in the final manifest for support equipment to be transported to Argentina for Aquarius integration and test. Since a need to unload the EGSE shipping crate had been not identified to the project until just prior to the incident, there was insufficient time to coordinate and plan the EGSE off-load. Quality Assurance was present during the incident, but System Safety was not notified of this unplanned unloading of Aquarius EGSE. Two individuals were injured as a result of this incident. The first struck his head on the pavement when he fell backward while avoiding the falling equipment. The other suffered a muscle strain while trying to restrain the EGSE rack as it rolled off the tilted lift gate. The container and lid were then moved into the Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) airlock for visual inspection. Visual inspection did not detect any equipment damage other than the detached shipping container lid, and the damaged shipping crate was replaced. The personnel were treated with basic first-aid, and then they returned to work (Reference (2)). The test equipment required recalibration, full functional test, and internal visual inspection. Due to a lingering concern about possible damage, however, replacement EGSE was obtained for use with Aquarius flight equipment (Reference (3)). There exists some residual concern by the Aquarius project due to the risk posed by plans to move JPL Critical Items (JCI) from Argentina to Brazil, and from Brazil to the Vandenberg Air Force Base launch site. JPL has recently revamped the process of preparing and reviewing transportation plans. The process is now reflected in the formal procedures of JPL Security, and preparation of a transportation plan is now a contractual requirement to be added to JPL subcontracts (Reference (4)). Also, the JPL Project and Engineering Management Committee (PEMC) has approved adding a transportation plan requirement to the next release of the JPL Flight Project Practices.

Many of these capabilities are to assist in characterizing flight at high angles of attack, while some provide significant research in their own right. Of these, the thrust vectoring system, the unique ability to rapidly reprogram flight controls, the reprogrammable mission computer, and a reprogrammable On-Board-Excitation-System have allowed an increased utility and versatility of the research conducted. Because of this multi-faceted approach to research in the high angle of attack regime, the capabilities of the F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle were designed to cover as many high alpha technology bases as the program would allow. These included aerodynamics, controls, handling qualities, structures, instrumentation, flight avionics systems, and propulsion. To achieve these goals, new capabilities were developed to enable this research to occur some were outstandingly successful; others were not.","1. Use of an all-inclusive steering committee of all the stakeholders was an outstanding asset to the execution of the program. Being all inclusive meant all voices were heard, and even when unanimous decisions were not reachable, consensus was achieved, which maintained long term viability of the program and the project. Frequent communication was essential for this to happen within the steering committee. 2. Insufficient systems approach to the facilities, equipment, and planning occurred. Despite having extensive experience within the team with systems engineering, insufficient excess capacity was designed into the system because the entire lifecycle was not understood at inception. Requirements creep resulted in taking additional time, effort, and energy to incorporate research which was not mature at the start of the design. 3. Careful attention to risk management, both programmatic and technical, was a valuable asset in every phase of the program. In particular, sensitivity to the aircraft systems was paramount. 3a. In one instance, the aircraft's flight control computers failed to pass the Built-In Test on several occasions during the Day-of-Flight checks before passing the Built-In Test. As the pilot and crew continued the preparation for flight, several engineers in the control room stopped, took stock of the situation, and decided to cancel the mission until the reason for the failures was understood for the aircraft not passing the Built-In Test. 3b. In another instance, the Spin Recovery System (spin parachute) was reinstalled on the aircraft. The convention at that time was to fire the chute system from a benign flight condition as a system test. In most spin parachute systems, there is a small (but finite) potential for loss of the aircraft if the chute cannot be jettisoned. In the case of the F-18 HARV, the project team decided to fire the chute on the ground in a high-speed taxi test only (this was done twice) and to NOT fire the system in-flight as a system test. This reduced the risk exposure to the aircraft and flight crew, while still testing the system in a representative environment. It should be noted that two other high angle of attack programs decided to fire the spin parachute in-flight as a system test (X-29A and X-31A). 3c. As well as making careful estimates for improvements and changes, be sure to define, well in advance and with careful planning, the deletion of specific envelope expansion hardware (or safety hardware). This needs to be carefully coordinated as part of the continuing airworthiness and flight safety process. In the case of the F-18 HARV, after the envelope expansion was complete, the need for the spin recovery system and the emergency power systems (battery back-ups, another system that was tested and demonstrated in ground tests) could have been removed from the aircraft. A current example might be the Fight Termination System onboard a UAV, or a system augmentation of the Flight Termination System. 4. Testing, both ground and flight, always uncovers deficiencies and contingencies that need to be planned in. This is true in the integration phase, but also (and in particular with one-of-a-kind research systems) in the flight phase. One aspect of this was the use of carrying extra flight cards in the briefed cards for a mission. Even though we knew we could not achieve all the test points, excess cards were always carried. If one piece of instrumentation failed during a mission, then other cards could be substituted and a full mission could be flown. Up to 140% of a mission's cards would be carried on every mission. Having these contingencies in mind during planning is useful as well. If a particular flight control load developed unforeseen problems, a previous load (for which lower priority test points are still waiting to be flown) can be reloaded and lower priority missions continue while the unforeseen difficulties are resolved. The ground testing of the system wa greatly streamlined by the presence of the Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation residing at Dryden. The hardware simulation, being co-located with the aircraft and the research team, minimized impacts to the schedule. 5. Use of a Class B envelope for Class B software (flight control laws) is very useful. However, careful attention needs to be paid to the corners of the Class B envelope to assure that, truly, the envelope is Class B. In particular, the lower right corner (for static structural loads) and the upper right corner (for flutter), and the upper left corner (for aeroservoelastics). Class B software is quickly reconfigurable, and flexible.","1. Use of an all-inclusive steering committee of all the stakeholders was an outstanding asset to the execution of the program.

One of the lessons learned that was discussed focused on the Apollo program/engineering management approach to reliability (Reference (1)): The Apollo engineering culture proved key to meeting objectives in a program environment in which technical performance was primary, schedule was secondary, and cost was a distant third. Throughout the program life cycle, the Grumman and NASA cultures encouraged (1) an environment of open communications that fostered attention to detail; (2) a focus on the mission rather than on the organization; (3) ability to challenge technical assumptions; (4) assignment of managers to work as technical contributors; (5) worker buy-in or ownership of the design, schedule, and flights; (6) a high level of dedication by NASA and contractor personnel; (7) astronauts who were visible to the design team; and (8) a contract type (e.g., Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee) that matched the program priorities. Anyone could challenge a design at any time, and Grumman challenged NASA expertise as often as the customer confronted the contractor. Astronauts were ""always there"" at Grumman, and that their lives were visibly at stake exerted pressure on engineers to ""do things right the first time"" wherever possible. Business arrangements influenced the program results: had the Grumman Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract instead been issued for a fixed price, then technical objectives could not have dominated over cost. To complement this culture, Grumman's Apollo program organization was very flat, with a minimal number of layers. The site organizations were structured to mirror the NASA headquarters organizational structure such that all Grumman personnel knew the identity of their NASA counterparts. Strong technical expertise was provided at all levels of the organization. Program management personnel had strong technical backgrounds, and the purchasing personnel who were initially responsible for subcontract management were soon replaced with technical personnel. The national priority and public interest focused on the Apollo program meant that NASA and its contractors could attract the country's best engineers and scientists. Unlike NASA, the reliability function was placed within the Grumman systems engineering organization instead of the mission assurance organization. This relationship enabled the Systems Reliability Group at Grumman to be deeply involved in system design and in the review of design tradeoffs. Grumman recognized that it was the reliability part of system engineering that would determine the early system configuration. Although subsystem engineering (e.g., propulsion, crew environmental control) reported vertically, the systems engineering organization (e.g., thermal, dynamics) was structured horizontally to assure technical penetration of design interfaces. When subsystem managers reported a failure mode, it was easy for Systems Engineering to task system integration engineers to modify interface hardware, and then advise the Crew Systems Group to modify the Caution & Warning System, Simulator Operations (crew training), and Mission Rules as necessary. Reliability was a concern at all levels of the engineering and program organizations. Organizational interfaces with Grumman subcontractors and suppliers permitted reliability products, such as Failure Mode and Effects Analyses (FMEAs) used to find single point failures, to cover all hardware tiers. Nevertheless, problems occurred on certain assemblies (e.g., batteries) where FMEAs were not passed down to subcontractors. Also, there may have been more duplication of engineering analysis between NASA and Grumman (and other system contractors) than was necessary. Given that ground support equipment (GSE) was a large part of the program, the organizational separation between the engineering of GSE and flight hardware may not have been optimal. This constrained the close examination of GSE failure modes (e.g., over-voltage conditions) that could harm flight equipment. Apollo Lunar Module design engineering focused on the early resolution of (1) reliability problems related to interfaces and (2) other critical design issues such as micrometeoroid protection and the Landing Gear Subsystem. This was facilitated by lunar mission planning performed by Grumman's Apollo Mission Planning Task Force (AMPTF), which designed the baseline vehicle and established ground rules and constraints (e.g., daylight launch, daylight landing near the lunar equator, water landing on Earth) to serve as a baseline for the mission design. Establishment of the AMPTF assured that all design elements were traceable to a common ""reference mission,"" and that design organizations did not make inconsistent design assumptions (e.g., regarding the capacity of the propellant tanks). Functional diagrams were used for reliability analysis, as well as for educating new project staff on the detailed lander design. The design engineering process featured strong configuration control, with Grumman project management represented on the Apollo Lunar Module change control board. This change control board was given significant authority: the NASA and contractor program managers met, decided on a course of action, and issued a joint program directive. The initial Apollo core competencies and technical skills in reliability engineering were not that high by today's standards, as experience was limited to the Mercury and Gemini programs. Most training was performed on the job, although this proved adequate. Training materials were not widely available: instead, functional diagrams were used for training as they were developed. Although reliability engineering was an established field, little information on best practices or lessons learned was available.

The best practice for obtaining legitimate electronic components designated for flight hardware is to know your supplier and to avoid buying parts other than directly from OCMs or their authorized distributors. In addition, this lesson suggests implementation of awareness, prevention, detection, and response strategies to mitigate the risk of incorporating counterfeit parts. Although electronic components are a particular concern to NASA, materials and mechanical parts may also be subject to misrepresentation.","For mission-critical components used in flight hardware and in JPL Critical Items (JCI): Assure Awareness of Counterfeiting.Charter an internal anti-counterfeiting task force with representation from key procurement, engineering, manufacturing, and legal organizations. Develop and deploy anti-counterfeit education and training programs for internal and external stakeholders. Benchmark other companies and suppliers, share best practices, and pool information on anti-counterfeiting strategies. Implement Prevention Strategies. The following preventive strategies have proven effective: Designers must proactively manage the product lifecycle against the component lifecycle and update a design when products are hard-to-find or unavailable. Know your source: build a relationship with suppliers, conducting surveys of their inspection and testing capabilities and audits of their counterfeit prevention programs. Institute an approved vendor list policy for independent distributors, ascertaining that they are certified to ISO 9000 and have not had previous problems with counterfeit parts. Require a documented trail identifying the source of the material, and work with the OCM to obtain photos of the parts or labels for validation. Procurement should buy direct from original manufacturers or their authorized distributors, verify that manufacturers have guaranteed methods to destroy scrapped parts, and buy adequate stock of last time buys. When buying from third-party independent distributors, require proof of traceability to the original component manufacturer and be aware that pursuing the lowest possible price can lead to sourcing problems. Make purchases contingent upon the outcome of evaluation, testing, or after verification of authenticity. Institute Detection Strategies-- Inspect, Test, and Evaluate. The following detection strategies may minimize the risk of counterfeits: Require rigorous quality assurance on all parts. Do not substitute paperwork for testing and visual inspection. Upgrade inspection training and procedures for identifying counterfeit components. Examine labels for misspellings, omissions (missing sales order number, missing lot numbers), date codes on the label that do not match the date code on the part, inconsistent formatting, etc. Establish and maintain a package and die pedigree photo collection to help identify counterfeits. Verify the part markings with the manufacturer when buying from independent suppliers. Maintain a reference library of manufacturer data books on obsolete components. Electrically test any material from questionable sources. Employ Destructive Physical Analysis (DPA) to deconstruct sample parts. Implement Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods where applicable. Respond to Disclosures. Participate in reporting and cooperate in investigation programs for suspect devices; respond to reports, including those from the Government/Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) and the Electronic Resellers Association International (ERAI). Cooperate with the NASA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in any action against suspected counterfeiters.",JPL,1/14/2008,"Reference (1) describes the pervasive and increasing problem of counterfeit electronic components and the countermeasures being employed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the aerospace industry. According to the JPL article, counterfeit parts include: Components with original component manufacturer (OCM) markings that were stolen and are being sold without testing. Dummy components with no die or wires inside, but marked as authentic. (Figure 1). Scrap stolen from the manufacturer, but marked as good product and sold at the normal price. Re-branded parts from a low-quality manufacturer, marked with the logo of a high-quality manufacturer and sold at a premium price. Recycled component sold as new. Blacktopped and re-marked integrated circuit (IC) (Figure 2), with a: Newer date code, Bogus part number, Commercial part re-marked as up-rated or up-screened without any assessment or testing, or Recycled, reclaimed, pulled, or salvaged piece part marked as new. Obsolete product pulled from stock of old boards and sold as new. Figure 1. X-ray image of dummy component with no die inside and no wires, although outside markings appear authentic. Figure 2. Device made by one manufacturer was blacktopped and overprinted with the markings of another manufacturer. Counterfeit goods represent approximately 5 to 7 percent of world trade; since 1982, the value of bogus goods traded globally has increased from $5.5 billion to approximately $600 billion annually (Reference (2)). Several factors contribute to the targeting of the electronic component market by counterfeiters: Device obsolescence has caused an increase in the scarcity and price of critical components used in military and civil aerospace systems. The flow of information through internet product search engines (IPSEs) facilitates finding obsolete or hard-to-find devices, and obtaining delivery overnight or within a few days. But internet purchases may provide no traceability or complex part sourcing history, minimal warranties, and no certainty of replacements or refunds. With the increasing sophistication and complexity of component technology, it may be more difficult to detect fakes. Testing of incoming items has decreased over the years, resulting in a reliance on the suppliers' Certificate of Compliance as proof of authenticity and compliance. Unauthorized gray market channels for legitimate products can facilitate distribution by counterfeiters. Gray market distributors cannot determine whether a high volume influx of a product is a counterfeit or a legitimate OCM product that has been redirected from the source. Subcontract assemblers and manufacturers may not report suspect devices in order to protect their reputation for quality. The best practice for obtaining legitimate electronic components designated for flight hardware is to buy them directly from OCMs (first-tier suppliers) or their authorized distributors (second-tier suppliers). Because this option may require the purchase of large quantities (minimum buys) or long lead times, projects may resort to independent distributors (i.e., gray market third-tier suppliers) for non-flight hardware-- breadboards, prototypes and engineering models. For schedule or cost-constrained projects, the rapid delivery of smaller quantities may offset the risk from limited or missing component traceability data. However, purchase from a third-tier supplier will increase the risk of receiving counterfeits, and it may not be feasible to mitigate this risk if the engineering model is later upgraded to a flight unit. JPL has formed a working group, with representation from the procurement, quality assurance, parts engineering, and technical infrastructure organizations, to address and mitigate the threat of counterfeit electronic components populating hardware assemblies. An action plan based on current industry best practices includes the JPL-wide measures for counterfeit awareness, prevention, detection, and response listed in the Recommendations section below.

The LM prime contractor (Grumman Corporation) and NASA shared responsibility for system reliability, provided for early Reliability Engineering involvement in evaluating design alternatives at the cross-Apollo system level, placed great emphasis on identification and elimination of critical single point failures, provided for extensive design redundancy, conducted parallel development of alternative technologies, tested critical hardware beyond qualification levels to the point of failure, and performed rigorous root cause analysis of failures. The Grumman retirees also recommended active management of design margins, providing the lunar lander with generous instrumentation and telemetry capabilities, and furnishing a strong Lander advocate during CEV design.",The Constellation lunar lander program faces challenges similar to those faced by the Apollo program 45 years ago in terms of achieving reliability and mitigating crew safety-critical and mission-critical risks.,"Lock system reliability into the early design such that the test program is relied upon for screening and verification. Emphasize identification and elimination of safety-critical and mission-critical single point failures, independent of numerical estimates of the failure probability. Assure that a strong quotsystems reliability groupquot is involved in evaluating alternative designs very early in the project life cycle. This early involvement should extend down to the subcontractor level, with subcontractors providing inputs to functional and system level reliability analyses. Assure that system requirements are assessed for their reliability impact prior to release of the system-level RFP. Evaluate design alternatives and conduct trade studies at the system level to obtain an optimal overall design. For example, it may be necessary to overcome organizational barriers between projects within the Constellation program to assess whether extra mass should be allocated to the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) launch vehicle, the CEV, or the lunar lander. Provide a primary and a redundant backup where feasible, preferably by dissimilar means, for safety-critical and mission-critical systems. Trade functionality between the lander, the capsule, and the service module to get the optimal integrated solution. For subsystems with a low technology readiness level (TRL) early in project development, mitigate the risk to reliability by funding the parallel development of alternatives. To accommodate future Constellation lunar lander system design changes and unanticipated flight configurations, test critical hardware beyond its qualification test levels until it fails. This allows a more accurate picture of true margin-- important for a new, complex system with many interfaces. This characterization can be used to address unknown problems and future tradeoffs. Consider incurring the additional cost of testing the actual flight hardware to environmental acceptance test levels. Establish success criteria for every test and every flight. Consider testing the Constellation lunar lander systems for the range of environments consistent with different lunar landing locations. Assure that contractors employ rigor in root cause analysis of failures, and provide NASA oversight over the evaluation and implementation of corrective actions. Actively manage performance margins so that the design margin can be allocated optimally. For example, provide a wealth of flight instrumentation and telemetry resources to assist ground controllers in timely identification of problems during mission operations and to support Constellation onboard maintenance. To achieve lunar lander reliability under the Constellation program, provide a strong Lander advocate during the design of the CEV.",JPL,10/22/2007,"As part of the Constellation Program's review of human spaceflight lessons learned, NASA hosted a July 20, 2007 panel discussion with a group of engineers who were members of the Apollo Lunar Module Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) Team. The team members are retired employees of Grumman Corporation, the prime contractor for the Lunar Module (LM). One set of lessons learned that was discussed focused on the Apollo approach to reliability engineering (Reference (1)): The Apollo approach of shared NASA/contractor responsibility for achieving LM reliability (Reference (2)) strengthened efforts to incorporate reliability features into the design. As indicated by Figure 1, reliability was infused into the design relatively early in the project life cycle, with part of the achieved reliability captured by design requirements by the release date of the NASA Request for Proposal (RFP). Because NASA issued a brief RFP that stated only functional requirements, and the Grumman program plan (Reference (3)) accepted by NASA committed only to these high-level requirements, Grumman retained substantial freedom to make LM design tradeoffs. Had NASA allowed discipline experts to impose detailed design requirements in the RFP without a full understanding of system-level impacts, some requirements might have detracted from mission success and crew safety. Figure 1. Apollo LM reliability growth (approximation performed in 2007 for use in Reference (1)) The Systems Reliability Group at Grumman placed heavy emphasis on assuring their early involvement in evaluating design alternatives, such as allocating mass to fuel vs. to payload and allocating functions to hardware vs. software. The LM system had only 10,000 lines of code, and the panel discussion suggested that functional requirements implemented in software instead of hardware might decrease weight at the cost of reliability. Decisions on the system configuration were heavily influenced by early weight vs. reliability trade studies that made effective use of flight simulation, and used math models to compare configurations. In retrospect, if NASA and their contractors had made these trades at the integrated system level (Reference (4)), they could have obtained the best reliability increase per pound added to the Apollo booster/Command Module/LM system. For example, if a few extra pounds for an additional battery had been added to the Apollo LM, it might have provided the power needed to make the LM a more comfortable lifeboat during the Apollo 13 return trip. Redundancy was employed extensively in the effort to minimize the number of potential single point failures. Apollo LM designers in cross-functional, reliability-oriented teams sought to provide extensive redundancy by dissimilar means. For example, the secondary abort system employed hardware and software that was different than that used in the primary guidance system. Component redundancy (e.g., use of dual valve regulators) was employed where feasible. Parallel technology development, such as the simultaneous development of both fuel cells and batteries as alternative power sources, was also used to mitigate the system reliability risk. Because the test program design was based on a lunar environment that was unknown and a mission profile that was then uncertain, it evolved over time. Developmental flight hardware was stressed to failure, well beyond the environmental uncertainty factor of 1.5 used to set the qualification test levels. This provided an additional environmental margin that accommodated design changes later in the LM project. In contrast, International Space Station (ISS) developmental hardware was not tested beyond qualification levels, and during ISS operations certain necessary flight orientations exceeded these design limits (Reference (5)). The actual Apollo LM flight hardware was tested to flight environmental levels with continuous operation to screen design and workmanship failures. All failures were subjected to very rigorous root cause analysis, and corrective action plans were approved at the NASA level. Although reliability prediction per MIL-HDBK-217 was then in common use by aerospace engineers, the methodology provided very limited benefits to the LM project. The designers were driven by the need to eliminate single-point failures (SPFs) that could impede mission success or harm the crew. Hence, changes were required for designs that contained SPFs even if a calculation predicted a low probability of failure. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) performed at the system and functional levels was very effective in identifying failure modes (including failures of other contractors' interfacing hardware) and evaluating design modifications. In hindsight, though, performance of FMEAs at an even lower tier (i.e., the subcontractor level) would have revealed problems (like solder balls floating in switches) earlier. But careful analysis would not have sufficed without tenacity by the Grumman Systems Reliability Group in forging the necessary design modifications to ensure mission success and crew safety. The Apollo 13 near-disaster revealed the importance of obtaining operations data in real time to support safety-related decision making. For example, the triggering of a CO2 alarm at the warning system engineer's console in Houston alerted the mission to the need to take extraordinary measures to save the crew. Mission success requires mission operations staff to expect the unexpected. This requires the generous allocation of flight instrumentation and telemetry resources to the system for timely identification of problems during mission operations. In addition, real time simulations conducted on the ground to evaluate proposed corrective actions proved their worth.

Worst Case Analysis (WCA) is a uniform, disciplined, systematic approach to circuit analysis that determines whether each circuit and each assembly meets its specified electrical performance attributes over the most extreme but realizable combinations of part variation sources. The lack of a structured WCA activity jeopardizes the integrity of the initial circuit design over the project life cycle.",The absence of a structured WCA activity jeopardizes the long term integrity of the initial design. The probability of failing a hardware qualification test and of subsequently needing design modifications is greatly increased.,Design all circuits to perform within defined tolerance limits over a given mission lifetime while experiencing the worst possible variations of electronic piece parts and environments.,JPL,8/13/2007,"This lesson learned is based on Reliability Practice number PD-ED-1212, from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: The practice of designing and analyzing electronic circuits for worst case environments and part variations maximizes the probability of mission success by assuring that all assemblies meet their mission electrical performance requirements at all times. Implementation Method: Worst Case Analysis (WCA) evaluates factors that may cause hardware to degrade or perform out-of-specification based upon a variety of input factors. For electronic circuits, the analysis generally includes the effects of temperature, initial tolerances, aging, radiation, and other effects as appropriate. The analyst derives part parameter variations for the environments and life of a specific mission and combines them with the initial tolerances of the parts as procured to produce a worst case part variation database for each mission or project. Applying classical circuit analysis techniques, the analyst can determine if each circuit and each assembly meets its specified performance attributes over the most extreme but realizable combinations of part variation sources. Technical Rationale: Classical reliability practice is generally associated with minimizing catastrophic failures of parts. Of equal importance, however, is assuring that the desired essential mission controls and scientific measurements are made with the intended accuracy, fidelity, and stability. To this end, a uniform, disciplined, systematic approach to performance design verification is essential. Uniformity is achieved by use of a common part variation database by all analysts on a specific project. Discipline is achieved by a common analysis containing qualitative and quantitative circuit performance attributes which are traceable to the assembly, subsystem, and system requirements. Also required is a stated or implied level of statistical confidence which results from the use of either an EVA (Extreme Value Analysis) or an RSS (Root Sum Squared) approach to the circuit performance variation at some statistical level, usually 2¿ or 3¿. Another statistical approach is the Monte Carlo (MC) method of repeated trials with randomly selected combinations of part variations. Table 1 compares the relative merits of these three approaches and summarizes the differences in input and output formats and information content. It is generally recommended that the EVA be applied as the required method for non-serviceable hardware because of its extreme conservatism. The RSS and MC methods are considered approximately equal to each other if utilized at the same statistical level. Both methods can be safely employed for serviceable or recalibrateable equipment, but are considered the lowest level of confidence allowable for non serviceable (i.e. satellites, spacecraft, etc.) hardware. Both the RSS and MC methods should be accepted only as a formal waiver to the EVA process. Any circuit which does not meet its attributes at 3¿ extremes cannot be considered high reliability in the functional sense. To achieve the project benefits from performing a WCA, the commitment must be mission wide to prevent any quotweak linksquot in the performance chain. For critical circuitry, preliminary analyses may be required to validate a conceptual design approach at Preliminary Design Review (PDR). For maximum benefit, the WCA is typically conducted concurrently with detailed design and completed in advance of, and in support of, the Critical Design Review (CDR). Impact of Nonpractice: Early designs of electronic circuits were either empirical or considered initial part tolerances only. This proved to be inadequate in that equipment often failed to remain within specifications at extreme temperatures or over prolonged life. More disciplined approaches followed, but analysts functioning independently were inconsistent in their part variation assumptions. The number of test and field failures fell, but still remained intolerably high, and large systems suffered from inconsistent risk levels. Since WCA first came into practice around 1965, its systematic use by a competent circuit designer has been found to increase the probability of the output design passing all WCA criteria. The absence of a structured WCA activity jeopardizes the long term integrity of the initial design. The probability of failing a hardware qualification test and subsequently needing design modifications is greatly increased. Using inherited hardware designs in environments which are different from the original adds an additional degree of jeopardy if there is no documented WCA from which to extrapolate. Reference: 1.

How Solved: The Human Engineering Office was established within the Spacecraft Project Office. Human Engineering was included at a visible level for RFPs and WBSs.","1. Human Factors Engineering requirements that are carried as applicable requirements should not be ignored; rather they should be (a) adequately funded, (b) implemented in the design definition, and (c) properly verified. 2. Human Factors Engineering personnel with training, experience, and expertise should be hired and retained at NASA and at the contractors as key personnel. 3. Human Factors Engineering design tools should be funded to enable spacecraft-specific research and design development, providing actual data from trade-off studies. Include 1-g full-scale mockups and multi-degrees-of-freedom simulators as well as virtual simulators. 4. Human Factors Engineering awareness training and re-education should be provided to NASA and contractor management, budget controllers, contracting officers, design discipline leads, as well as to legislative and executive branch government leaders. 5. Emphasize that Human Factors Engineering is a primary systems discipline necessary for safe and efficient spaceflight. 6. Human Factors Engineering scope and language at NASA and among the contractors must be standardized with the overall Human Factors Engineering community. For example, does Human Factors Engineering include everything in NASA-STD-3000 or is it limited to what might be funded for crew systems and cockpit layout? For example, does habitable volume mean the same thing to each NASA and contractor player? 7. Human Factors Engineering should be included in the work breakdown structure (WBS) of the new program, Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). Preferably this should be done in the Systems Engineering / Systems Integration section; alternatively a standard Human Factors Engineering statement should be called out in every WBS callout for deliverables having human interfaces. 8. Spaceflight proposals should include a stand-alone section on Human Factors Engineering, with emphasis on scope, personnel, resources, and facilities all with sufficient funding to accomplish a successful Human Factors Engineering design. In addition, the introduction and executive summary should make it clear that Human Factors Engineering is a primary system. 9. Data from Human Factors Engineering assessments and tests should drive lower level requirements and resulting design. 10. Human Factors Engineering should be involved and integrated in the daily engineering problem solving and integration process. 11. Human Factors Engineering should have signature authority on all designs and drawings affecting human environments, interfaces, and interactions. 12. Human Factors Engineers with training, experience, and expertise should be the ones making decisions on Human Factors Engineering. This should be done with participation, but not domination, by users (crew, ground support personnel, mission controllers) and managers.",KSC,3/25/2004,"There was a continual struggle for acceptance of Human Engineering, during the evolution of the SLI and OSP programs. The status, visibility, responsibilities, resources, and authority of Human Engineering vacillated. At the end of the OSP cycle, the Human Systems Office had achieved a seat at the table. This allowed human factors engineers voices to be heard and resulted in human factors engineering being integrated into other systems of the OSP. However, many decisions were being made about OSP that initially ignored the human as the primary reason for the mission, and then tried to retrofit the human into the physical and dynamic parameters that remained in the trade space. Even though the human was emphasized in Level I requirements and in Request for Proposals (RFPs), both NASA and the contractors had to be frequently reminded that the human is an essential driver for requirements and deliverables for human spaceflight. Placing human system requirements last in priority will result in higher costs for training and operational work-arounds in order to accommodate. We know from ISS crew debriefs that there are interface issues that lead to continual workarounds; interfaces are in conflicting designs. If NASA would do a life cycle cost analysis, then the impacts to training and operations costs would become very apparent. The root causes of Human Factors Engineering requirements being deemed of low priority center around three phenomena: (1) hardware and software short-term schedules and cost concerns often lead to decisions to ignore Human Factors Engineering requirements with the rationale that the human is malleable and can adjust to the design, (2) some project managers, decision makers, and designers think that because of their human experiences they are human factors experts, and (3) claims that a human can endure or accomplish almost anything with the proper motivation or rationale.",,OSP,,Exploration Systems,Public,Formulation » Phase B,,8/31/2007,Systems Engineering and Analysis,use,

This problem can be alleviated by refining the operations and science data return planning process. This should reflect a priority scheme based on (1) a minimum volume requirement (30 Mb for MER) and (2) a daily assumption of achieving a data volume level of one sigma (1 standard deviation) less than the predicted volume.,"Constrained by mass, cost, and schedule, the Mars orbiter and Mars rover UHF antenna system designs and test programs have exhibited sol-to-sol variations between predicted and achieved link performance. Though not unexpected, actual data return uncertainty has necessitated modifications to the rover mission planning processes for operations supported by the orbiters. The difference between the predicted versus achieved data volume returned by the MER UHF data link has sometimes impacted the daily planning of rover driving and science data collection. Although for a small number of sols this resulted in a data return less than the maximum achievable, the greatly extended MER surface mission duration has returned science data that has vastly exceeded requirements and the most optimistic early expectations.","Develop a data return planning process based on analyses of link performance that anticipates and plans for the unpredictable characteristics of UHF omni links. Also, be prepared to update the process as a result of subsystem and spacecraft development, test, and flight operations experience. Data return planning should begin with an estimate or model of the predicted data volume statistics which may feature a mean value and variance that change over time. With an assumption of achieving a data volume level for the sol of one sigma (1 standard deviation) less than the predicted volume, prioritize the data return for (1) mission operations and (2) high priority science data. Lower priority data will then be relegated to any remaining data volume actually achieved during the sol. For future mission, reassess the predicted data model as the design and test of antennas, mission planning tools, and procedures evolve.",JPL,10/5/2006,"By relaying data to Earth through one of the spacecraft orbiting Mars, the two Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) were able to transmit science data at a higher rate than by direct links from the Martian surface to the Deep Space Network (DSN). However, these surface-to-orbiter relay links (via the UHF frequency band) are known to be less predictable in total data volume as compared to direct-to-Earth links (via X-band transmission). The data volume received during orbiter overflights has exhibited nominal variations of 75 to 125 percent of the volume predicted, and extremes of 50 to 150 percent of the predicted volume are occasionally experienced. Reference (1) is a very recent statistical study that for the first time documents MER data volume variations over 186 recent overflights. The study found that 11 overflights achieved less than 75% of the predicted volume and 78 passes exceeded 125% of predicted. Additional statistical studies are underway. Tactics such as changing a rover¿s heading to facilitate communications after a day of driving and science activities have sometimes been necessary to attain an MER data return goal of 30 megabits per rover per quotsolquot (Martian day). Because there are multiple contributors to relay link variability, it is hard to identify and quantify the factors that contribute to the difference between the predicted and received data volume on a specific overflight. This is true even after engineering analysis of available rover and orbiter telemetered data, leaving mission planners with uncertain expectations as to actual performance. The impact on mission operations has been an inconsistent flow of relay link data during Mars surface operations. This has caused the following problems for the MER science team (Science Operations Working Group): When a UHF data relay pass yields a data volume that is less than 30 megabits, the science team may lack sufficient information (i.e., pictures of the rover¿s surroundings) on the current sol¿s drive to safely plan the next day¿s drive. In contrast, larger than anticipated data volumes may represent a lost opportunity for the science team. Had they known, the team would have planned for more activity by rover instruments or higher image resolutions so that the extra telemetry capacity would not have been wasted. (See Reference (2).) The inability to consistently and accurately predict actual relay pass data volume is not an MER design or operational anomaly. It is an anticipated result of a telecommunications system constrained by the spacecraft mass and configuration, project budget, development and testing schedule, and operational factors, including: The UHF antenna pattern on MER is highly variable and not completely understood, even after extensive preflight mockup tests and post landing data collection. The UHF antenna pattern is further modified by local geologic surroundings which change the multipath signal phase and signal power. Geologic changes variables include proximity to a hill, proximity to a crater, proximity to a large rock, and changes in the electromagnetic properties of the underlying soil/rock as the rover changes location. Rover tilt impacts antenna pattern. Predicted rover tilt is only known to a few degrees, and the relationship between tilt and antenna gain pattern is not modeled. Rover yaw angle is set to one of 20 steps, with the data volume computed based on the gain value for the step. Thus there is uncertainty in the gain pattern and in the resulting data volume due to this quantization. In addition, the gain pattern may be further changed by deployment or retraction of a rover appendage. The Mars orbiter UHF antenna gain pattern is also variable based on the pointing angle to the rover. It may further change with variations in orbiter solar panel orientation. The Mission Operations Team has limited insight into which of these design and operational factors apply, and the extent to which they apply, on a given relay pass. Constrained by mass, cost, and schedule, the MER lander project and the Mars orbiter projects elected to use omni directional UHF antennas mounted in the midst of a crowded science deck. This resulted in highly variable and unpredictable antenna gain patterns (Figure 1). Due to the same program constraints, testing of the antenna patterns was limited to model mockups which have limited fidelity. Thus much of the UHF link performance variability and uncertainty resulted from engineering and programmatic decisions with known consequences. (a) Drawing of an MER-like rover with a monopole UHF antenna with a radiation pattern having many lobes and nulls. A quotmeterquot indicating link predictability to an orbiter overhead displays a moderate reading. (b) Same as Drawing (a), except the MER-like rover is tilted and overhung by a crater lip. The meter reads at the low end of the scale. (c) Same as Drawing (b) with tilt and crater, but now a hypothetical future rover sports a high gain, steered UHF antenna that aims a single lobe toward the orbiter. The meter reads at the high end of the scale. Figure 1. Effect of antenna design on link volume predictability The majority of MER overflights have produced data volumes reasonably close to predictions. UHF data has totaled about 90 percent of the science data returned from the rovers. Use of the Proximity-1 protocol has assured that virtually all data actually returned is error free (Reference (3)). References: Andrea G.

Consider benchmarking the distribution of emergency response resources at JSC as a ¿best practice¿ for all NASA centers.,JSC,3/14/2006,"An electrician suffered burns from an electrical arc/blast when a pre-existing condition in a power distribution panel ultimately led to a ground fault in a 3-phase 480-volt power supply. The pre-existing condition was believed to be an access panel fastener that had penetrated conductor insulation. The response of local emergency resources to the mishap was exemplary, but would have been delayed if the injured worker had not just done his own safety task analysis just before the mishap. The safety task analysis included among other things locating fire alarm pull boxes and extinguishers; who to call in case of an emergency; what hazards were in place in the work area; etc. This safety task analysis is routinely performed before each task to ensure that risks are minimized prior to start of work. Because the worker pulled the alarm box within ten seconds after being injured, emergency response teams responded and were at the scene within 3 minutes of the event. Response was initiated before detectors triggered alarms at the Emergency Operations Center and the fire station. The employee was already showing signs of shock upon arrival of fire protection specialists who administered first aid until the paramedics arrived a couple minutes later. The patient was transported to a downtown hospital¿s burn unit and arrived within 40 minutes of the emergency. At the same time first aid was being administered, additional fire protection specialists began to fight the small fire in the building. The fire was extinguished immediately with a dry chemical extinguisher and before the fire suppression system was triggered. Damage/loss of mission-critical equipment and facilities was averted. The reported community standard for emergency response is for resources to arrive at the scene within 30 minutes of notification. Without a working fire suppression system in place, total building involvement would have occurred. The presence of onsite resources plus the pre-established response by the employee reduced response time to 3 minutes.

With resources scarce at all levels and close oversight and scrutiny (both internally and externally), the importance of the inevitable matrix organizations established to carry out programs and projects from formulation through implementation cannot be overemphasized. The AATT Project made a significant effort in communicating and developing agreements with key partners such as the FAA, as a primary receiver/user of the Project»s products. A multitude of Memorandum of Understanding/Agreements, etc, were established and utilized during the life of this project. Clearly, the partnership with the FAA proved to be the Project»s greatest challenge. With continuous management and organizational changes at all levels, policy and procedure changes, etc., AATT experienced problems, as grouped and summarized below: A. Interacting with, and learning to work with an entirely different federal agency such as the FAA: It took much time and resources to experience and understand key cultural and organizational differences involving everything from policy, procedures, politics, and communication processes in both technical and administrative/management domains. Comments at all levels across the AATT Project demonstrate that this was one of the most significant ongoing challenges. The FAA failed for a number of reasons to provide consistent single points of contact (POC) for any appreciable length of time. One manager reports that “the average life” of an FAA POC has been less than 2 years”. Also, unexpected union issues and concerns ensued with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) and the Professional Airways Systems Specialists (PASS), which were increased since AATT had a presence at more than one FAA facility. To further complicate things, continual shifts and/orreorganizations within the FAA resulted in AATT technology being moved from organization to organization constantly requiring NASA managers and researchers to educate and establish relationships with new FAA personnel. B. Resource Support: As the AATT Project matured, FAA commitments to provide joint support funding, personnel and/or facilities declined for a number of reasons. AATT learned the high risk this really is from the start and how it can lead to de-scoping, schedule delays or tradeoffs not originally foreseen. C. Technical Transfer of Project Products: AATT invested much time and energy in working with a number of FAA POCs at various levels to establish an agreed upon process and understanding of technologies to be passed on for further development and implementation into the National Airspace System (NAS). The FAA has stated that they are often unprepared for the research NASA develops that they are then expected to further develop and implement into the operational environment. The AATT tailored TRL (Technology Readiness Level) process has been used for these purposes. An ongoing problem AATT has experienced is the FAA»s desire and need to know how a newly developed NASA technology being handed over, will fit into the evolving NAS. D. External Agreements and Management Support: As indicated above, the AATT Project was subjected to much instability and organizational dynamics in its relationship to the FAA. Formal agreements that were made and in place between the FAA and the AATT Project regarding technologies to be prototyped, demonstrated, and transferred in support of stakeholder requirements were ignored. In light of this, it is crucial to gain long-term top-level management support from any and all key participating organizations including necessary resource commitments.","For all of the above listed examples, the importance of establishing strong up-front relationships and communications between all levels of management authority down to working collaborations cannot be overemphasized. This is especially important when two large federal agencies are involved that must work successfully together to research and develop complex technical concepts and tools that must be passed from one to the other for implementation into the operational systems of the real world.","A. A strong partnership with the FAA that includes the FAA Air Traffic organization buy-in and support is necessary for NASA to be successful in air traffic management research and technology demonstration. Access to FAA controllers and facilities is a critical element and impacts resulting from FAA Labor Management problems/issues must be limited. It is important to continue whatever positive relationships and interactions are formed with FAA personnel regardless of their direct connection to FAA/NASA formal organizational relationships. Some in AATT have suggested that an FAA “champion” be identified for technical advocacy of each tool or concept NASA is developing and planning to hand over and that specific funding to support this advocacy be set aside. This “champion” must know the technology and be highly supportive of its potential benefits. B. Future projects and programs should not make assumptions regarding resource commitments and ensure that the realistic possibility that these may not come through is included in the project»s risk management and mitigation plans. FAA personnel (both civil service and contractor) should work in NASA ATM Labs to ensure and facilitate the technical understanding and working relationships. Of course, withdrawal of resources and/or deliverables promised due to management/organizational priority or political changes should be held to a minimum. This includes not just funding, but also personnel, expertise, management, administrative support and facilities. NASA requires a consistent and stable relationship with key customer organizations like the FAA and this relationship should be reflected in top level policies, procedures and resultant agreements across all involved agencies. Related to the above, when project milestone success criteria have external dependencies, such as FAA resources and approval for controller evaluations, they are extremely vulnerable. NASA should not establish program level milestone criteria that are dependent on FAA schedules. As an example, almost half of the AATT Project was completed before a process stabilized for requesting and obtaining controllers for tests and simulations or access to FAA facilities. To mitigate these situations when they do occur, the AATT Project recommends setting milestone and success criteria such that should an external dependency fail to come through, the milestone can still be met with resources under the project»s control. C. A clear understanding of the engineering rationale for design decisions would make the FAA better equipped to plan the deployment process, evaluate deployment sites, establish guidelines for evaluation, manage controller expectations, and address new technical challenges. In turn, the FAA must clearly define the metrics by which a system will be evaluated and adhere to them as development progresses. The operational concept should be clearly communicated to all deployment sites so that they understand what kind of functionality was developed and for what reasons. In the future, NASA will have to become more involved in defining how to integrate our new system tools into the NAS and work more closely with FAA personnel to understand the NAS and plans for its evolution. We need to insist on being involved in understanding current FAA systems and development efforts in order to ensure that our products get fielded and used operationally. This will require that all partners agree on which technology to develop and transfer and FAA acceptance should not be limited to controllers at just one site. Additionally, NASA needs to ensure it is delivering everything the FAA needs for their Joint Research Council (JRC), including documentation. D. Top level management support and the resulting agreements must be documented and signed by individuals with appropriate responsibility and authority to assure commitment and delivery by all parties throughout the life of the project. A single executive POC within the FAA responsible for identifying and resolving any issues or problems with an appropriate time metric for resolution is desirable. AATT could also have benefited from more advocacy and support at the Program and NASA Headquarters levels especially in coordinating and negotiating with the FAA. AATT found that the Interagency ATM Integrated Product Team (IAIPT) was not very effective in making or enforcing the critical connections, negotiations and agreements. Resultant joint agreements must be continuously communicated downward to all participants/contributors and honored for the life of the project. If NASA is to be successful in influencing the modernization and transformation of the NAS, a process for air traffic management research transfer must be developed and agreed to at the highest levels in NASA and the FAA and subsequently adhered to throughout the life of each program/project.",ARC,1/1/2005,,,,,"Aeronautics Research, Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Not Specified,,1/20/2006,,not use,

As a result, reviews tended to overlap in their charters and often provided conflicting recommendations. Those involved in projects would be more motivated to support reviews if they could see and experience distinct and valuable purposes that each review served. Independent review committees are not slowed (or do not take) adequate review time to understand the project»s work, accomplishments, etc. and alignment with schedule and budget. As a result, many of the findings are incorrect or misleading as a result of misunderstandings or lack of knowledge about the project. B- Reporting: General feedback received – Too much disconnected upward reporting with little downward direction where the Program and/or Headquarters express direct interest or understanding in the work of the project and helping to make it successful. AATT spent a lot of time and resources dealing with high-level issues throughout the life of the project. C- Technical Publications: The AATT Project Office made a special point to request and remind technical and sub-project managers that project recognition be appropriately documented in technical publications. This was a recurring problem throughout the 9-year life of the project.","Too many reviews and reports that often times are repetitive and redundant providing the same information in different formats to different managers and teams, is costly in time, resources and moral. Every minute taken to put together and prepare huge packages of information that does not seem to be read and/or understood, takes away from a manager»s time and resources to assure the work of the project is successfully accomplished.","A. It is recommended that there be fewer independent reviews, each with more time allotted to the project under review. There should be adequate time provided for discussion of the draft findings with the project manager, for a feedback loop that may lead to the committee modifying or refining its findings. Related to the above is up-front accurate communication to the projects exactly what the reviewer wants covered in terms of content. Too often AATT Project personnel were trying to determine what the reviewers wanted to see and hear. A reasonable and practical amount of format/content standardization would be helpful in preventing waste of time and having to scramble to get what the review committee decides it really wants to see on site during the review itself. B. The obvious ideal reporting scenario is one that minimizes duplicative, redundant and multiple ways of providing the same information. A single Agency-wide reporting/information system should be developed and carefully thought out with the input of those having to provide the information. Project managers should only have to deal with this kind of thing once a month (at most) and it should suffice for all organizations and levels of management including Program Management Councils. The only thing that might be different is the level of detail, but in no case should detailed project level information be required that is not really necessary for upper level managers to have. This becomes micro-management at its worst and can result in inefficient waste of scarce resources and time. Project managers usually end up spending valuable time away from managing their projects in order to answer questions and explain to those not knowledgeable or involved in the specific needsand day-to-day operations of the project»s work. C. The AATT Project recommends that project recognition in publications be brought up and made a written policy to all involved individuals and managers from the very beginning. The appropriate standards, including place and format should be discussed and agreed to as part of this policy arrangement.

Use of PLC's in system design will reduce failure rates and subsequent downtime, ultimately saving a program money.",Use solid state Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC's) in system/equipment design to control and monitor systems and processes.,HQ,11/30/1994,"This Lesson Learned is based on Maintainability Technique number OPS-05 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4628, Recommended Techniques for Effective Maintainability. System/equipment design using PLC's is a prime example of the application of maintainability design objectives. PLC's are designed with ease of maintenance and troubleshooting as a major function. When virtually all components are solid state, maintenance is reduced to the replacement of a modular, plug-in type component. Fault detection circuits and diagnostic indicators, incorporated in each major component, can tell whether the component is working properly. With the programming tool, any programmed logic can be viewed to see if input or outputs are on or off. PLC's provide control capabilities not possible in the past. Control systems incorporating programmable controllers are now able to operate machines and processes with an efficiency and accuracy never before achievable with conventional relay-based control systems. Usually, PLC architecture is modular and flexible, allowing hardware and software elements to expand as the application requirements change. If an application outgrows the limitations of the PLC, the unit can easily be replaced with a unit having greater memory and input/output capacity, and the old hardware can be reused for a smaller application. PLC attributes make installation easy and cost effective. Their small size allows PLC's to be located conveniently, often in less than half the space required by an equivalent relay control panel. On a small scale changeover from relays, the PLC's' small and modular construction allows it to be mounted near the relay enclosure and pre-wired to existing terminal strips. Actual changeover can be made quickly by simply connecting the input/output devices to the pre-wired terminal strips. Table 1 lists some features available and benefits of PLC's. [D] In large installations, remote input/output stations are placed at optimum locations. The remote station is connected to the processor by a pair of twisted wires. This configuration results in a considerable reduction of material and labor cost that would have been associated with running multiple wires and conduits. PLC Components and Operation PLC's, regardless of size, complexity, or cost, contain a basic set of parts. Some of the parts are hardware; others are software or programs. Figure 1, identifies the basic parts of the PLC. In addition to a power supply system and a housing that is appropriate for the physical and electrical environment, PLC's consist of the following parts: an input interface, central processor unit (CPU), memory section, programming language, programming tool, and an output interface. [D] The Input Interface provides connection to the machine or process being controlled. The principal function of the interface is to receive and convert field signals into a form that can be used by the central processing unit. The Processor and Memory provide the main intelligence of the PLC. Fundamental operating information is stored in memory as a pattern of bits that is organized into working groups called words. Each word stored in memory is either an instruction or piece of data. The data may be reference data or a stored signal from the process that has been brought in through the input interface. The operation of the processor and memory of the PLC can be described as a fairly simple repetitive sequence: Look at the process being controlled. This is accomplished by examining the information from the input interface. Compare the information with control information supplied by and stored in the program. Decide whether any control action is needed. Execute the control action by transmitting signals to the output interface. Look again at the inputs. The processor continually refers to the program stored in memory for instructions concerning its next action and for reference data. The Output Interface takes signals from the processor and translates them into forms that are appropriate to produce control actions by external devices. The Program and Program Language. The program is written by the user and stored in the PLC. The program is a representation of the actions that are necessary to produce the desired output control signals for a given process condition. The program includes sections that deal with bringing the process data into the controller memory, sections that represent decision making, and sections that deal with converting the decision into physical output action. Programming languages have many forms. Early versions were restricted to match the conventions of relay logic which consisted of ladder diagrams that specified contact closure types and coils. This type of program consists of a representation of a relay logic control scheme. The relay ladder language types are still popular. Alternative languages use Boolean representation control schemes as the base of the computer representation. The Programming Tools provide connection between the programmer and the PLC. The programmer devises the necessary control concepts and then translates them into the particular program form required by the selected PLC. The tool produces the pattern of electrical signals that corresponds to the symbols, letters, or numbers in the version of the program that is used by humans. Process Improvements The use of control and monitor equipment with the benefit of a PLC could lead to: Increased system availability Decreased downtime requirements to recover from a failure Decreased cost in materials and man-hours for installation Increased system visibility Increased flexibility to meet new requirements.

The objective of the team is to develop and flight-test control systems that use neural network technology to optimize the performance of the aircraft under nominal conditions as well as stabilize the aircraft under failure conditions. Failure conditions include locked or failed control surfaces as well as unforeseen damage that might occur to the aircraft in flight. The IFCS team is currently in the process of implementing a second generation control scheme, collectively known as Gen 2, for flight testing on the NASA F-15 aircraft. The research controller is a dynamic inverse controller based on the Versatile Control Augmentation System (VCAS) control laws developed by James Buckley at McDonnell Douglas Aircraft. The baseline control laws were taken from the F-15 ACTIVE ILTV program, but the IFCS team has removed the thrust vectoring controls for the Gen 2 implementation. For the original dynamic inverse controller, the proportional, integral, & derivative (PID) gains were tuned to achieve linear stability robustness, ASE mode attenuation, and non-linear system command following for the nominal (no failure) case.",Dynamic inversion controller contributes significantly to cross-coupled response in presence of surface failures (locked surface).,"The Beta-dot controller was able to eliminate the lateral-directional coupling issues noted previously. The Beta-dot controller was chosen because it was straightforward to implement and had been used successfully in previous programs. The Beta-dot controller uses the rudder pedal input, as well as information from the aircraft sensors for ny, velocity, stability axis yaw rate, pitch angle, and bank angle as inputs. The Beta-dot controller does not use Beta as an input due to the fact that the only source available is from the nose boom measurement of Beta, which is a single-string source. The research controller necessary for flight test is a hybrid controller using dynamic inversion in the longitudinal and lateral axes, with a classical control used in the directional axis. This modification was necessary in order to obtain reasonable flying qualities for the nominal research controller with no neural network adaptation present.",AFRC,2/2/2005,"While testing the original dynamic inverse controller with locked stabilator failure simulations, significant lateral acceleration (ny) and angle of sideslip (Beta) excursions as a result of lateral stick inputs were noted. One inch of roll stick input would cause lateral accelerations of -0.5g and Beta values as high as 5 degrees. Because subsequent re-designs of the neural network were not able to modify this behavior and pilot comments from simulation sessions continued to be negative, it was decided that the research controller be modified so that the lateral and directional axis would be de-coupled in the research controller. This was accomplished by using a Beta-dot classical controller for the yaw axis, while continuing to use the original dynamic inverse control for the pitch and roll axes.",,,,"Aeronautics Research, Exploration Systems",Public,Not Specified,,7/12/2005,,use,

Repeated attempts to restart the engine that same day were unsuccessful.Solar electric propulsion (SEP) imparts a small thrust by passing ions through two closely spaced, charged grids (Figure 1). Should a loose conductive flake bridge the gap between the positive and negative charged grids, it could short the grids leading to automatic shutdown of the engine. Molybdenum flakes commonly peel off the grids late in the ion engine&apos;s life.

This helps operations personnel more effective and helps assure ""minor"" changes will not become major problems. Systems engineering must be done to assure adequate transition from development to operations and to assure proper flow of information between all disciplines, including operations. A formal method of documenting project ""concerns"" should exist and be made available to all disciplines. Assure adequate staffing to support critical operations, especially during operation. Project personnel must be aware of the project's reporting mechanisms for incidents, anomalies, concerns, and should be trained in when and how to use them. End-to-end software verification & validation must be performed to minimize potential software vulnerabilities. Assign a person who is responsible for continually asking ""What could possibly go wrong?"" Take full advantage of formal analysis methods such as fault tree analysis, FMEA, etc. to help analyze potential hazards, concerns, etc. This makes the process less subjective, therefore less prone to error.",MSFC,12/30/1999,"Following the MCO mishap, the ProSEDS team decided to perform an in-depth review of the MCO mishap report to gather lessons learned and recommendations that could prevent future problems for ProSEDS project and would help prevent NASA from repeating past mistakes.",,,,"Aeronautics Research, Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Not Specified,"<p><a href=""./documents/1381_ProSEDS.pdf"">ProSEDS Mission Safety/Success Review Report</a></p>",2/9/2004,,not use,

Performing an annual reevaluation of existing risks and identification of new risks helped strengthen the Projects risk awareness and its sensitivity to RM. The use of outside experts and peer reviews to help manage risks proved to be an acceptable replacement for the traditional involvement of the Center's System Safety and Mission Assurance Office (SS&MA). However, the Project may have benefited from many of the RM tools common to the SS&MA office such as checklists, taxonomies, templates, and lessons learned.","For projects already implementing RM when a new methodology or process comes into vogue, the following should be considered. The project should consult with the experts or owners of the new processes to determine if it is cost effective to transition to the new way of doing business. Partial transition or adoption of new tools should be considered as ways to enhance the existing processes. Tools that target a specific area that is not included in the existing methodology should be incorporated into the existing RM process. Specific tools associated with the new process should be used as a cross check against the methods already deployed. When primarily using outside experts and consultants to help the project's RM planning, traditional sources of knowledge such as the SS&MA originations should still be used in a review capacity. There may be existing tools that the project can use.

Project management should be included in the proposal stage of a project's life cycle since the lack of front-end PM support increases the difficulty to introduce a project environment later. 2. Inserting a PM into a project for a ""recovery"" or ""rescue"" mission may be an unwelcome and unsuccessful venture if the project does not recognize its potential value and/or does not identify with the incoming PM. 3. Do not expect a team to ""abandon"" their loyalty to the PI in favor of an outside PM. 4. Do not expect an academic team to buy into formal PM processes immediately. 5. Abrupt and frequent PM changes create/increase the rift between the science/engineering team and the management team. This also gives the appearance that Senior Management does not view or appreciate the critical role which project management plays in a project's success or that the project is not valued. 6. In addition to each project lifecycle phase, lifecycle transitions also require management and planning, especially those that deal with major changes in control/authority, business practices, and culture.","Based on the above observations and LL the following recommendations have been developed to help others plans for successful Project lifecycle transitions: 1. Ensure that a potential project has PM representation at the earliest possible time (ideally the proposal phase). 2. Ensure that all proposals go through a formal approval process that includes representation from all project management elements. Enlist the expertise from Center resources such as the System Management Office, Chief Engineer, Training Office, and Mission Assurance Organizations. 3. Senior Management should aid the blending of science and PM teams by communicating the rules-of-engagement (ROE) and expectations to all parties involved. Furthermore, any commitments the Senior Management make to accompany and aid a new PM should be followed through or else the new PM and their direction will loose credibility. 4. Metrics indicating the progress of a project's transitional period should be defined, collected, and used to maintain the project on track. 5. The temporary and periodic use of transition/change management experts and facilitators should be considered for high-risk transitions, especially those requiring cultural changes or major changes in business practices. 6. The transition ROE should distinguish between ""rescue"", ""maintenance,"" and ""change of direction"" PM changes. These different situations that necessitate a PM change should be used to determine how significant procedure changes should be. The new PM under rescue situations should be supported by Center-wide experts/resources and not left on their own. 7. The existing and incoming project team members should be willing to compromise on procedure rigor and formality such that the focus is on risk reduction and results. Short cuts and processes with less rigor may be appropriate under certain circumstances.",ARC,1/1/2003,"The Project underwent several significant transitions including going from a proposal team to an implementation/project team; Principal Investigator (PI)lead academic or science team to a Project Manager (PM)lead hardware development/delivery team; and PM to PM. Within these transitions the Project struggled with two issues that were major obstacles to implementing a ""project"" oriented environment. First, the Project had difficulty recognizing the incoming PM as an authority over the PI, who in this case was a well-known and respected scientist that germinated the Project concept. The Project team's loyalty to the PI coupled with the abruptness with which PM's were assigned lead the project team to view the incoming PMs as outsiders unfamiliar with the Project's purpose or style who insisted on unfamiliar and time-consuming operating requirements/processes. Second, the Project, which had originally been a small scientific research team, had difficulty establishing and applying formal/rigid project management processes. Thus, the inadequate PM involvement during the proposal stage coupled with the un-facilitated/unmanaged transitions never allowed the team to mature into an integrated project. The result was that the Project's initial planning was off (as described in a companion LL on cost estimating) and the subsequent attempts to redirect it through formal PM processes were unsuccessful.",,,,"Aeronautics Research, Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Not Specified,,7/28/2003,,use,

Integration of NGN's many components was a challenge both in terms of the management of the system-to-system interfaces and in the management of lines of authority and reporting for the various organizations involved. One of the methods used to manage this complexity was to charter a quarterly review panel consisting of “stake-holder” participants with management authority of the various NGN components.

This resulted in additional fuel flow to the MCC and Nozzle coolant circuit and reduced fuel flow to the preburners. The increased MCC coolant flow resulted in an increased LPFP turbine flow which increased its speed and its discharge pressure which in turn exceeded the LPFP discharge pressure sensor qualification limit and resulted in an MCF. The lack of sufficient fuel to the preburners caused the high turbine discharge temperatures which approached the redlines. The shutdown due to the MCF occurred via the standard hydraulic sequence and it was a safe shutdown. For additional lessons learned please also see the findings listed under the ""recommendation"" section below.","Finding: The procedures at Stennis Space Center (SSC) are designed to provide maximum flexibility and adaptability. Each procedure attempts to anticipate all possible situations which leads to very voluminous and complex procedures that are difficult to follow. Recommendation: Restructure and re-format the SSC procedures to reduce complexity, ambiguity and to enhance the probability of being understood by technicians and inspectors prior to performing the work. Consider individual planning for unique jobs with the aid of computers and include/adopt either the KSC or Canoga Park system or elements thereof. Finding: The initial release of a SSC procedure is formally controlled, however, subsequent modifications in the field are not, and the responsibility for establishing the options is unclear. The system relies on redlining and DNAing major sections by technicians, inspectors, engineering, and quality engineering to custom fit the procedure to the specific circumstances at hand. Technicians and inspectors routinely DNA and redline procedures. In some cases, the hardware is not subsequently under the control of the person selecting the DNA option. Recommendation: Procedures should be reviewed and approved by engineering for accuracy and revision as required for the identified task prior to release to the floor. Decisions affecting hardware configuration should be made by engineering in the course of the review; not left up to the floor technicians and inspectors. DNA/NA options to be exercised on the floor should be limited to those actions where results are immediately verifiable and obvious. DNA/NA options which require decisions where the results are not under the control of the affected line personnel should be disallowed, and if situation changes, new planning should be issued. A procedure deviation system for initiating deviations to correct errors/oversights would be helpful. Deviations should be reviewed prior to the use of a procedure. Redlines should be limited to minor pen and ink changes not affecting intent, e.g., typographical errors. Finding: Disciplined implementation of existing procedures was inadequate by floor technicians and quality assurance personnel. Technicians performed five procedural steps in the CCVA procedure (Rework #49) that, if properly accomplished, would have disclosed the missing hardware. The QA inspector stamped four of these five. Three other steps were performed in this procedure that would have possibly disclosed the deficiency. The procedure was clear in these areas and the careful accomplishment of these actions with all parties properly fulfilling their roles would have prevented this problem. Recommendation: Personnel performing operations must fully understand the importance of their tasks and consequences of incorrect action(s). They must understand the significance of their stamps on the planning whereby they certify and agree to the accomplishment/verification of the specific task(s). Technicians and inspectors should not stamp work they have not personally witnessed. Reinforcement of these responsibilities through additional training/orientation by supervision appears to be warranted to assure the proper level of discipline is in place. Finding: Performance in accordance with the current procedural system does not assure that the hardware configuration is under control through all phases of disassembly/reassembly. Recommendation: The procedural control of hardware configuration needs to be addressed and changes instituted to assure the hardware configuration is known and under control at all times. This should apply to the transfer of hardware status from one type of paper to another, to procedures controlling the hardware transfer, storage, issuance, and to the procedures for verifying configuration integrity. Finding: A major SSC planning document deficiency is the absence of a list of parts required to start the job and of parts to be left over after the job. Recommendation: Incorporate in planning a list of required parts and a list of parts to be left after the job. Finding: The existence and location of flight and test hardware on test stand A-1 appears to be uncontrolled. The uninstalled coupling was found on level 5. There was a line assembly on level 5 that belonged on level 8. On level 8, a shim was found that should have been left in building 3202. Recommendation: Institute a system that inventories and controls the location of test and flight hardware on all test stands. A preferred approach would be a centralized location rather than multiple locations. The parts crib should be a controlled access area with an individual responsible for inventory of incoming parts and issue to technicians. Parts should be segregated and identified in the crib in such a manner that they can be unambiguously located and retrieved for a particular job/engine. Finding: Flight engine 2032 was shipped from building 3202 to the A-1 test stand with a considerable amount of open work and a sizable box approximately 4 X 8 X 4 feet with loose parts. The exact configuration of the engine as shipped was not clearly defined and the absence of parts lists did not force reacting to an unaccounted left-over part like the coupling. Recommendation: Discontinue the practice of shipping flight engines with open work unless the work is related to high pressure pumps. Provide an inventory list of loose parts shipped with the engine and to be installed, and a list of parts to be removed from the engine and centrally collected prior to hot fire testing. Institute a system that reacts to parts left over and unaccounted for. If parts to be installed are shipped separately, they are to be identified on the inventory list not as being in the shipping box but as still to be delivered. A verification system should be in place at the engine position that provides assurance of hardware configuration. Finding: Technicians and inspectors interviewed did not know that the actuator which was to be installed was new and being installed for green run purposes. It appeared that the working people in general are not being briefed as to long term objectives. Recommendation: Establish an information system such that also technicians are aware of long term objectives and not just near term objectives of getting dates, paragraphs stamped off, and the paper closed. Finding: No clear identification of a responsible development engineer having full responsibility for the successful accomplishment of a given task. Recommendation: Assure the clear identification of a lead development engineer and full delineation of his responsibilities for each job. Finding: Integration of Government Agency and contractor procedures is inadequate as evidenced by the existence of conflicting instructions concerning mandatory inspection points. Recommendation: The Government Agency letter dated November 24, 1987, concerning a post activity closed paper review of DNA/NA operations having a Government Agency review within them should be rescinded.",SSC,3/3/1992,"Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) test 901-0674 was conducted on November 6, 1991 at 11:31 am CDT.

During shipment one end of the latch locating tool (drill platform) slipped from the dolly and landed on the truck floor. Upon arrival at destination, the subcontractor refused the shipment due to its apparent faulty shipping condition and the platform and dolly were returned to the point of origin. One of the roller subassemblies was discovered to be missing. Tool Fabrication was able to replace the roller subassembly. A subsequent tolerance check of the tool determined that it was within tolerance and the tool was re-certified. The complete tool was then properly packaged and re-dispatched to the subcontractor. Root cause: Successful teamwork requires that the team include all appropriate personnel/contributors. Also, a small amount of additional information in the right place on key documents can greatly reduce confusion and chance for error. The following details describe a systemic breakdown in the process. Engineering originated a Work Release Order (WRO) to ship the Mobile Transporter latch locating tool to the subcontractor. The latch locating tool consists of two parts: Part 1 (Drill Structure for prismoid holes: approximate size 5 x 8 feet), and Part 2 (Drill plate for sensor strips @ approximate size 6 x 10 inches) The drill structure has a dedicated storage container (tool engineering considers this a part of the tool.). Instead of shipping the two parts in their respective storage containers, the drill structure was shipped along with its handling fixture (dolly) and Part 2 was left behind. The handling fixture has two locking bolts to secure the drilling structure during ground handling. The drill structure was not properly restrained by the locking bolts. The bolts were to be installed in the ""V"" between the front rollers, instead they were installed aft of the front rollers, thus not providing any horizontal movement restraint until the rear rollers reached the locking bolts, allowing the front end of the tool to slip out of the holding fixture and strike the bed of the truck. Finding 1: Tool was not properly identified by Tool Control. Drill structure and handling fixture were shipped. The drill plate was left behind. Tool Control has the responsibility to: Identify the tool to be shipped (ensure the tool is complete) Prepare the tool for shipment (package/containerize as required) Prepare Request for Shipment form (RFS, MDM - 0625) Send ""RFS"" to Shipping Department (when tool is ready for shipment) After shipment, receive ""Packing Sheet"" and update inventory log, to indicate the tool has been shipped. Finding 2: Tool was not properly packaged for shipment: dedicated container was not used, resulting in drill structure not being properly secured in the handling fixture. Finding 3: WRO did not state (nor was it required to provide the detail) that the tool consisted of 2 parts. It did not explain that the handling fixture is not to be included in the shipment.

In response to this, the test team decided to limit the maximum cowl angle to 8* so that the roll limit would not be exceeded again. The test data shows that at M=0.8, cowl fixed at 8*, the sting roll moment was 26,487 in-lbs, which slightly exceeds the allowable limit (26,000 in-lbs). No action was taken to this condition. The lesson learned was that the test team's response to the limit was not congruent with the nature of the test conditions. At M=0.8, the model was in a region that had not been analyzed.

Upon investigation, a previously unknown hardware-software interaction was discovered. [D] In the design of the TS, the flight software commands a temperature measurement of the master crystal oscillator. This measurement is made to adjust the oscillator frequency to compensate for previously characterized, temperature induced, frequency drifts. The software then refers to a lookup table, and applies the appropriate compensation needed to keep the oscillator frequency within specification over the flight allowable operational temperature. Troubleshooting indicated that, due to a programming error, the software fails to power a sensor ASIC during the period when temperature should be measured by the device. This error was not apparent during ambient testing because the software defaults to a fixed level of compensation at room temperature. During assembly and test of the DS-2 flight hardware, a decision was made to delete TS bench thermal testing because of tight schedule constraints. Previous bench thermal tests of the flight subassembly hardware were believed to have been adequate and to have measured performance representative of the final delivered subsystem. The subassembly tests, however, did not exercise the flight software. Because the final subsystem test was deleted, an important hardware-software interaction was missed. The frequency drift was sufficient to cause a 0.5dB degradation of the DS-2 downlink signal from Mars Global Surveyor-an inconsequential effect given the large design margin in the downlink budget.

Pressure had built up inside the drums to the point where both the inside drum and recovery drum burst, propelling the drums 26 feet in the air, at which point it dented the roof and spilled hazardous waste into the containment area. The incident occurred late at night and no personnel were injured or exposed. Primary Cause: The waste stream contains a mixture of solvent-base paints and cleanup solvents. None of the vapor pressures of the waste components were great enough to cause failure of the drum. The pressure build-up was likely due to a chemical reaction producing a gaseous product. Polyurethane paint components of the waste stream contain isocyanate compounds which react with water to produce carbon dioxide. Although there were no accounts of water-based paints being added to the drum, the generator also uses latex paints, and some may have been accidentally added to the drum. The drum was routinely opened and closed during waste accumulation allowing release of the pressure. It was only when the drum was sealed for storage that pressure increased to deform and eventually rupture the drum. Contributing Factors: The bulging condition of the original 55-gallon drum was first noticed at a hazardous waste storage facility. The drum was overpacked into an 85-gallon recovery drum to correct the container condition deficiency, but the facility operator was unaware that the drum was continuing to build pressure. The 85-gallon salvage drum then obscured the condition to the hazardous waste shipper, transporter, and offsite receiving facility.

NASA and the contractor agree that demonstrated proficiency for operational tasks is a key factor to safety and success. NASA and the contractor recognize the direct relationship between personnel proficiency and flight safety, and this is reflected in the training, certification, and operator assignment processes implemented by both NASA and contractor. For ground operations involved in processing and operating the Space Shuttle systems, all newly hired contractor personnel are provided applicable training for security, safety, and the critical skills required for the area and system of their assignment. In addition to this general training, contractor personnel begin their orientation by becoming familiar with procedures, drawings, physical surroundings, etc. Once they have an understanding of these requirements, they accompany other experienced, skilled personnel on the job performing formal and informal on-the-job-training (OJT). In addition to the certification provided upon the successful completion of OJT, engineers must also complete Stand Board examinations for critical systems. Processing tasks are assigned based on the experience level of the employee. Processing tasks are not all equally critical, and newly-certified personnel are generally assigned to low criticality tasks. This allows the more experienced personnel to focus on critical tasks. Employees are required to be recertified on a regular basis. The recertification involves varying degrees of proficiency testing based on the functional criticality of the task. The concerns and needs for assuring that the contractor workforce has the appropriate skills and proficiency to perform Space Shuttle processing responsibilities are applicable to the NASA civil service workforce as well. Training plans are defined for all entry-level technical positions within NASA Shuttle Processing. These plans include both formal classroom training and OJT packages required for the performance of the NASA Space Shuttle operations role. Newly-hired or transferred personnel are required to accomplish this training prior to performing unsupervised engineering or technical tasks. The supervisor is responsible for assuring that the training has been accomplished and adequate proficiency has been demonstrated. There is also continuous involvement with critical task surveillance, out-of-family disposition, and NASA-retained functions to maintain the critical skills of the workforce. While the level of direct NASA involvement has decreased with the planned transition of more responsibility to the contractor, NASA Shuttle Processing has increased its focus on simulation training to augment the need for engineers to maintain their knowledge of systems performance and operations. Increased utilization of Tier 3 training (integrated simulation training) has been implemented. Tier 1 (single system) and Tier 2 (multisystem) simulation training is also being planned to ensure proficiency. Requirements definition for system development is now complete for Tier 1/Tier 2 training, and implementation plans are in work. In the flight operations area of Space Shuttle support, the Mission Operations Directorate and USA have jointly defined and documented training and certification criteria for all personnel assigned to mission-critical functions. These plans are based on the position requirements and criticality of the assigned position. The training and certification plans and processes are unique for flight designers, training instructors, and flight controllers. Personnel are not assigned mission-critical responsibilities without having executed formal training and certification plans, as well as successfully demonstrating the capabilities consistent with the level of responsibility required by the position. Extensive use of simulations for mission control teams and individual operators is used in both the initial certification and the continuous proficiency training of flight control operators. Experience level is a critical part of successful flight operations. To ensure that training, certification, and task assignment processes are such that only qualified personnel are performing Space Shuttle operations, NASA uses trending and root-cause analysis of quality and safety occurrences to indicate those traceable to training processes. This approach allows for a continuous assessment of the process of providing qualified personnel for performance of Shuttle processing and operations.

The ISS does require that toxic substances in payload racks be multiply contained.,"The ISS should require payload providers to include, as part of their system design, detection and annunciation of any toxics they carry or could generate.",HQ,2/1/1997,Payload Requirements for Hazardous Materials Containment,"NASA concurs. The approach for payloads on the ISS is patterned after the Shuttle approach. The payload design requirements are defined in NSTS 1700.7B, ""Safety Policy and Requirements for Payloads Using the Space Transportation System,"" and the ISS Addendum, which to date make the possibility of having a toxic spill so remote as to be an acceptable risk. Requirements imposed on payloads include containment levels stipulated based on level of toxicity of the substance or use of an approved pressure vessel. The payload provider is required to obtain approval by the Payload Safety Review Panel (PSRP) for the use of any toxic substance, as well as the containment method utilized. Through the safety process defined in NSTS 13830, ""Implementation Procedure for STS Payloads System Safety Requirements,"" all potentially toxic substances are labeled and documented in crew procedures, along with any cleanup instructions. This ensures that needed information on any potentially toxic substance is readily available to the crew. This concept for the handling of toxic substances is based on Shuttle and Mir program experience and has not been changed. When payloads are reviewed by the PSRP, compliance with the above requirements must be demonstrated. Astronaut training and procedures are reviewed and approved to ensure that the crew is adequately educated to avoid inadvertently mixing toxic chemicals. In addition, the payload design must still be able to tolerate the appropriate number of operator errors. These requirements do not impose design solutions on payloads; rather, they require the payload providers to proactively consider their own design solutions to avoid toxic mixing. Enforcing these requirements in the PSRP process by ensuring compliance with the requirements of NSTS 1700.7B will restrict the possibility for toxic mixing to an acceptable risk. Dependent on a case-by-case analysis, the PSRP or the payload provider may request detection and monitoring. The detection will then be provided by the payload provider organization with tie-in to the ISS core systems of C&W (annunciation) provided by core system interfaces at the rack level. This service will then be defined in the appropriate Interface Definition Document (IDD). The crew will be used to enunciate any toxic spills throughout the ISS. This is considered essentially the equivalent of the panic alarm. The crew will also be used to detect any toxic spill. Studies have shown that intermodule ventilation will spread any toxic gases to all elements of the ISS within 20 minutes, which makes station-level detection not practical. This further illustrates the importance of having adequate design requirements imposed on payloads to preclude toxic spills. Crew annunciation and detection have been considered acceptable because of the design requirements imposed on the payloads to maintain appropriate levels of containment. However, should a toxic spill occur, provisions are available to payloads for cleanup. These include a crew contamination protection kit (goggles, chemical resistant bags, chemical resistant gloves, emergency eyewash), a portable breathing apparatus, a combustion products analyzer, a volatile organics analyzer, multiple airborne trace contaminant control equipment, vacuum access, and module depressurization. The JSC Mission Operations Directorate is currently developing procedures to respond to a toxic spill. The procedures will be based on Shuttle experience. The response will depend on the hazard level of the substance, the state of the substance (liquid, gas, or solid), the location of the spill, and the size of the spill.",,,"Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Not Specified,,11/20/2001,,use,

These factors include potential number of training instances; dispersion of students/instructor; delivery period; shelf life of the course materials; instructor based delivery options such as Video-teleconferencing; synchronous vs. asynchronous delivery requirements; portability among training delivery systems. Note: As distance learning technology evolves other factors may need to be considered when determining the training delivery method. Advances in training technology now allow for the easy separation of development of course content and course templates (the operational look and feel of course delivery). For example, the Shared Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) has been recently developed as a standard means for packaging course content. Course content developed in accordance with this standard can be plugged into compliant training delivery systems. SCORM compliant course materials are also packaged in segments that can be used by multiple training courses. The goal being to encourage technologies that enable dynamic learning where content is custom-assembled and delivered to learners according to their own personal pace and need. This enables sharing of course content among different courses or training systems. In comparison the current SOLAR technology relies on static webpages specifically developed for a course/module. (The course content is not independent from the delivery system). Any reuse would require replicating the webpages and assembling them within a new course/module. Reusability of course segments or use in other training systems as in SCORM would allow development costs to be potentially spread over an even larger number of training use instances.",Carefully consider all factors when determining the method of training delivery.,HQ,7/26/2001,"In the 1995-1996 timeframe the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) began development of a distance learning capability under the umbrella of the Professional Development Initiative (PDI). This distance learning capability eventually evolved from a Safety and Mission Assurance discipline system into the Site for Online Learning and Resources (SOLAR) (http://solar.msfc.nasa.gov), currently one of NASA's primary distance learning resources. The intent of the initial development effort was to design and implement a prototype system for the Safety and Mission Assurance discipline. Over the five years since the initial release of SOLAR (or its predecessor) there have been approximately 2500 training instances (completion of a single module by a single person) in the Safety and Mission Assurance discipline's approximately 70 courses. Over this time period some Safety and Mission Assurance courses have as few as 20 training use instances while others have had several hundred training use instances. In other disciplines (such as Information Technology Security) where SOLAR is used for mandatory training there have been thousands of training use instances for a single course. Based on this data, is it reasonable to assume that a potentially large number of training use instances is the only determining factor in the decision to develop a web-based training course? Certainly the need to provide a large number of training use instances suggests web-based training as a candidate for content delivery since per training use instance development and delivery costs are reduced each time an additional student completes a course. In contrast the development costs for instructor based training are reduced each time an additional student completes a course but the delivery costs vary depending on the number of students, their location, etc. If the course content is appropriate for delivery via web-based training, then web-based training can be an effective method for training large numbers of students. If a large number of potential training use instances represents a good potential course for web-based development, does that mean that a small number of training use instances rules out web-based training as an alternative to instructor based training? The answer depends on several factors. Just considering the potential number of students alone is not sufficient to make the determination. The location of the students and the instructors must be considered. The cost to deliver training to 20 students that are collocated with the instructor is quite a bit less than the cost to deliver training to 20 students that are each in a different location, since travel, lodging and meals must be considered. (Note: Other options for providing the training such as the use of Video-teleconferencing may offset some or all of these costs and should be a factor in determining method of delivery). The period over which the training is to be provided and the shelf life of the course material must also be considered. If the course was to be delivered to 5 students a year for 4 years, web-based course delivery might be more cost effective than instructor based delivery. Again location of students and instructor would affect costs. The shelf life of the course material would also be a factor. If the course required no updates over the 4-year period then the development cost is spread over all of the training use instances. If updates were required during the 4-year period then each of those represents an additional development effort; in essence the ""single"" course would actually look like four courses from a development standpoint. One final consideration concerns the timing of the course. If all of the training instances can be accommodated simultaneously (synchronous) then even in a dispersed student population use of technology such as Video-teleconferencing could make instructor based delivery a consideration. If however the training can not be delivered simultaneously (asynchronous) web based training becomes more attractive.",,,,,Public,Not Specified,,7/30/2001,,not use,

In a related way, using reserve to overcome whatever difficulties may be encountered in the fabrication of ""first-time"" flight hardware is another activity that can quickly consume considerable reserve. Lastly, the exact performance needed to effectively validate the advanced technology may not be fully understood until rather late in the definition process and this may increase the cost of the spacecraft.",Future technology validation missions should carry a minimum budgetary reserve of 15% at the Confirmation Review.,GSFC,6/28/2000,"The New Millennium Program's First Earth-Observing Mission (NMP/EO-1) was selected for flight in March 1996 and completed its Confirmation Review in May 1997.

By the end of the Confirmation Review nearly 75% of this reserve was committed to additional mission definition, an overrun in one of the advanced technologies, and implementing four risk mitigation recommendations of the Confirmation Review Board. The Goddard Space Flight Center Program Management Council recommended that the EO-1 budget be augmented by 7.3% to restore the reserve committed during the definition process.

For example, failure to adhere to the proven practice of refurbishing recovered hardware from salt water impact can result in unacceptable performance, scrapping of otherwise usable hardware, expenditure of unnecessary resources, and possible schedule delays.","Engage in refurbishment activities to rebuild and prepare for reuse of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB's) after each Space Shuttle Orbiter launch.

Implementation Method: Refurbishment of SRB components is cost effective and conserves resources. This allows for reuse of SRB's, thus saving money for the program versus building new SRB's for each launch. Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) Refurbishment encompasses the activities required to return the reusable SRB component to a flightworthy condition after SRB ignition, liftoff, and flight; separation from the external tank; descent (free fall and parachute); ocean impact; and retrieval. When the decision was made to recover and reuse the SRB hardware, a design team was organized to formulate the maintainability criteria for a reusable booster. The SRB Flow Chart for Maintainability is shown in Figure 1. The maintainability design team produced the Solid Rocket Booster Maintainability Design Criteria Document (reference 1), a document that was used by designers as they conceived each design feature, performed the necessary tradeoffs of the design parameters, and made other design and product engineering decisions. The design team included maintainability as a design goal and incorporated the desired maintainability features into components of the end item throughout the design process. Maintainability factors that were considered during the design of the SRB are shown in Table 1. [D] Figure 1.

SRB Maintainability Factors Design Process Considerations Table 2 lists typical maintenance actions that were considered during the design process. The SRB was designed to withstand launch, water impact, and towback environments, incorporating the capability of 10 flights for the parachutes; 20 flights for electrical/electronic components, Thrust Vector Control (TVC) components, and SRM components; and 40 flights for the structures. SRB structures are typically welded and/or mechanically fastened aluminum except for the external tank attach ring, which is mechanically fastened steel. All aluminum structural assemblies are first painted and then coated with an ablative insulation. The SRM segments are forged D6AC steel. All structural components are cleaned and/or alodined as appropriate, before being primed and top coated with paint. The mechanically fastened aluminum and steel structural components are designed to be protected from salt water intrusion by applying sealant between adjoining surfaces, installing the fasteners with sealant, torquing the fasteners, and applying a fillet of sealant along the edge of brackets where they join the main structure. The electronic/electrical components exposed to salt water are sealed, and the external surfaces of these components are painted. The TVC hydraulic system is a closed-loop system that does not permit the intrusion of sea water. The SRM segments' external surfaces are protected with an epoxy paint finish, and the internal surfaces are protected by the propellant insulator that is bonded to the inside surfaces of the SRM segments. Areas not protected with paint or bonded-on insulation are protected with a water-repellent grease. Inspection Troubleshooting Calibration and Adjustment Repair Verification Table 2. Maintenance Actions Specific Improvements Typical areas of the SRB that have been redesigned or modified as a result of trouble areas found during recovery and refurbishment are discussed below: Galvanic corrosion occurred in the aft skirt of the first few SRB's recovered. To prevent this from recurring the design team added a zinc coating to selected metal components, and bolted anodes (Zinc bars) to some components of the TVC system. The aft skirts of the first few SRB's experienced water impact damage. The corrective action included the addition of gusset reinforcements to the structural rings. Foam was sprayed on the interior of the aft skirt to protect the reinforcement rings and the TVC components. Impact force with the water was reduced by increasing the diameter of the main parachutes from 115 feet to 136 feet. The larger parachutes decreased the SRB's water impact velocity from 88 ft/sec to 75.5 ft/sec (60 mph to 51.5 mph, respectively). During initial teardown and inspection, water and corrosion were found between the mating surfaces of structural members. To correct this problem, the sealant application specifications were modified to require the sealant to be applied to both surfaces before joining. To eliminate potential water entry into the forward skirt, the following areas were modified or redesigned: The aft seal on the forward skirt was changed from a rectangular to a quotDquot configuration to allow better contact between the forward skirt and the forward dome of the SRM. A fillet of sealant was added between the access door and the surrounding structure after final close-out of the forward skirt. Sealant was added to the mating surfaces and the installation bolts of the separation nut housing for the main parachute attach fittings. The following practices improved maintainability, parachute deployment, and parachute inflation: To avoid abrasive damage that occurred during main parachute deployment, foam and ablative material were added to portions of the frustum and the main parachute support structure. To avoid damage to the parachutes during deployment, the parachutes are now packed in a circular pattern rather than the previous zig-zag pattern. The opening at the top of the main parachute canopy was decreased in diameter to allow quicker inflation of the parachute. After every flight electronic components were being returned to the vendor for refurbishment. After refurbishment, acceptance test procedures (ATP) were performed, including vibration and thermal testing. The vibration level of these tests caused the remaining life of the component to be reduced. To prevent the excessive expenditure of components' lifetime (except for the range safety system components) vibration and thermal testing has been eliminated during normal turnaround. The constant improvement of electronic parts by the manufacturer presents a unique problem to the SRB refurbishment effort because the improved parts are often not interchangeable with their predecessors. A sufficient quantity of spare parts must be procured to meet logistics requirements until the components are redesigned to use the improved parts. Typical Refurbishment Procedures Figure 2 depicts the SRB flight configuration. After approximately 125 seconds into the Shuttle flight, the SRB's are jettisoned from the external tank. During reentry, the nose cap is jettisoned (it is not recovered), deploying the drogue parachute. After the SRB is stabilized in a vertical position, the frustum is jettisoned and descends into the ocean. Its descent is held to a safe velocity by the drogue parachute. In the meantime, the jettisoning of the frustum deploys the three main parachutes, lowering the remaining portion of the SRB into the ocean. Once in the ocean, the parachutes (which are jettisoned at water impact) and the frustum are removed by the recovery team and positioned onto the recovery vessel. A plug is inserted into the SRM nozzle throat and the SRB is dewatered. Removal of the water from the SRB allows the SRB to be positioned from a vertical position to a horizontal position. The SRB is then towed to the disassembly area dock. [D] Figure 2. SRB Flight Configuration At dockside, the SRB is lifted from the water and placed on dollies. The SRB pyrotechnics are disarmed, the TVC fuel system is depressurized, and an assessment team inspects and documents anomalies that may have occurred during flight. Then the SRB is washed with a detergent solution in a semiautomated wash facility. The aft skirt is removed and routed to the TVC disassembly facility. Table 3 lists a typical flow sequence for major structure refurbishment. After the aft skirt is removed, the remainder of the SRB is routed to the disassembly facility.

Table 3. Typical Structure Refurbishment Flow As the SRB components are removed, they are identified by attaching a metal tag with their part number and dispositioned per the Predisposition List for SRB Flight Hardware (reference 2). The SRB component is then routed to the refurbishment area where a prepared refurbishment procedure document is attached to the part. The part is reworked to conform to the Refurbishment Engineering Specification. This specification lists the requirements for refurbishing each component to flightworthy condition before it is returned to storage. The SRM segments are disassembled in the disassembly facility at dockside, placed on rail cars, and transported to the SRM contractor located in Utah. At the contractor's plant, the segments are off-loaded and routed to refurbishment areas. All segments that are to be reused must meet the requirements of specification STW7-2744 (reference 3). If segment dimensions fall outside the acceptable requirements of this specification, an individual analysis is required to determine the effect on the structural and sealing capability before reusability is determined. All documented nonconformances are reviewed to determine if the condition of the hardware has changed. The most critical areas to be reviewed are case membrane thickness, vent port and leak port threaded areas and sealing surfaces, and aft segment stiffener stubs. No surface defects (corrosion, pitting, scratches, noncrack-like flaws, etc.) deeper than 0.010 inch are permitted.

Benefit: In addition to improving the timing system's overall reliability by utilizing multiple timing sources, the upgrade from the previous Apollo-era designed system (using LORAN and WWV) provides improvements in the accuracy, monitoring and feedback capabilities. The timing system is used to provide timing commonality between instrumentation systems so data can be referenced with respect to time. Improving the reliability and accuracy of this system improves the time reference capabilities. Implementation Method: The primary time sources of the GPS Timing System are two GPS receivers and an Eastern Test Range UHF timing receiver. Each receiver's output feeds a Time Code Generator whose output feeds an Error Detection and Switching System. The inputs from different receivers are compared for bit error and phase error. Switching to a secondary input is performed if a fault is detected. The output is fed to Distribution Amplifiers for distribution throughout the KSC launch area (see Figure 1). [D] Figure 1. GPS Timing Block Diagram The GPS Timing System is equipped with a computer system that allows the operator to monitor all timing outputs including the signal source, signal level, distribution communication circuit number and end user. The timing signal is also displayed on an oscilloscope. This allows operators to quickly identify any distribution problems. On a daily basis, operators can page through every timing signal distributed from the LCC, checking the code and level of each signal. After checking all signals, the operator places the computer in auto mode, and the computer automatically checks the time difference between a cesium clock and all other timing units (two GPS receivers, the Eastern Test Range UHF timing receiver, two LORAN receivers, the Communication Instrumentation Facility time, ETR time and a portable clock time). The time differences are logged on a printer along with the following information from each GPS receiver: Greenwich Mean Time Satellites being tracked Oscillator control voltage Satellites selected Satellites deselected Antenna status The printout can then be reviewed by the operator and filed as part of the station log for historical purposes. The computer system is also equipped with a program that monitors the Timing Station at night and during other unmanned periods. The program pages through each time unit every 10 minutes, checking the time difference between the units and the Cesium clock. The time difference is logged on disk for use during the next work period when it is imported to a software application that can generate graphs for system analysis. Technical Rationale: Engineers at Kennedy Space Center require timing commonality between instrumentation systems so data can be referenced with respect to time. The development of the GPS allowed for the development of a timing system that is more accurate, more reliable and provides greater monitoring and feedback capabilities than the Apollo-era design it replaces. That system, using LORAN and WWV, resolved time to an accuracy of +\- 1 microsecond. The GPS system is accurate to within +\- 200 nanoseconds. Another advantage is that unlike LORAN, GPS satellites are capable of supplying the time and need not be used in conjunction with any other system.

The very nature of the critical systems which drive the requirement to use ATS to guard against loss of power demand maximum reliability.","This practice provides proven techniques for enhancing the reliability of Automatic Transfer Switches (ATS) used in critical applications. Systems which require the use of ATS may be optimized for fail-safe operation using worst-case design techniques and good maintainability/preventive maintenance practices. The probability of internal ATS failures which could result in loss of power to the load can be minimized by giving particular attention to the ATS transfer methods, power-switch types used, and regular attention to the health of the equipment.",KSC,2/1/1999,"This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1256; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: The major benefit of these design considerations is the greater assurance that loss of power to critical loads and the resulting consequences will not occur. Achieving optimum reliability is of paramount importance in systems that protect life and property. Along with the increase in the reliability of the ATS that is achieved, usually little or no additional design cost is required. Implementation Method: The implementation of these techniques has resulted in the elimination of critical failure modes in Automatic Transfer Switches used in the KSC Shuttle Landing Facility 60 Hertz Power System supporting critical landing aids. Increased system reliability and reduced maintainability costs are inherent features of these practices. Technical Rationale: For critical 60 Hertz Power applications which must use Automatic Transfer Switches (ATS) to provide redundant power sources, it is important to examine the following three design considerations which serve to minimize the probability of ATS failures that could result in loss of power to the load. The first of the three considerations involves the use of ATS's which are designed such that either molded-case circuit-breakers or molded-case switches can be used interchangeably as the switching devices. Only the latter should be used to avoid the possibility of a premature-trip of the circuit-breaker causing total loss of power to the critical load, or depending on the conditions used to cause the ATS to switch, the ATS could transfer prematurely. Whereas a premature transfer is not a critical failure-mode, any unnecessary transfer of an ATS supporting a critical load is undesirable because of the possibility of a system malfunction occurring due to transients or glitches caused by the switch-over. The potential for loss of power to the critical load caused by an open switching device in the ATS brings about the necessity to investigate the second consideration. The second consideration pertains to the technique used to cause the ATS to transfer to its alternate power source. Many ATS's employ a voltage-sensor circuit(s) to detect the loss of preferred input power. When the voltage sensor detects the absence of preferred input power, the transfer is initiated and the ATS switches the load to the alternate power source. In the event that the ATS switching device fails ""open"" as described in the previous paragraph, no transfer would occur because the voltage-sensor at the preferred input would not have detected any loss of input power. The result would again be loss of power to the load. Hence, the only sure way to guard against this failure-mode is to configure the ATS to sense loss of voltage at the ""load"" terminals of the ATS instead of at the ""preferred"" power input terminals. Thus, any internal ATS failure which would otherwise cause loss of power to the load will be neutralized. The intent of providing an ATS in critical power circuits is to eliminate single failures that would cause loss of power to the load. Eliminating the potential for these two types of internal ATS failure-modes significantly reduces the chances of the ATS itself becoming a single-fail point. The third consideration is maintaining the good working order of the ATS, i.e. maintainability and preventative maintenance. Because the ATS is used only for emergency transfer of power, and since maintenance could require taking down the system, regular maintenance may be repeatedly postponed or ignored until a real-time catastrophe reveals that the ATS will not transfer because of a maintenance related failure. Adequate preventative maintenance should not be substituted for convenience. Where possible, scheduled down-time should be used to complete an appropriate maintenance plan. In systems where down-time is not a convenient option, a hardware method of bypassing the ATS to facilitate maintenance should be installed. Designing the system for maintainability allows the required preventative maintenance to be performed without interfering with normal system operation. With the appropriate hardware configuration and preventative maintenance plan in place, optimum reliability can be achieved without any substantial increase in installation or operating cost. Any cost incurred, if any at all, to implement these safeguards is assuredly returned by the avoidance of a single failure of the ATS under worst-case conditions.",This practice has been used on Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility 60 Hertz Power System supporting critical landing aids.,,,"Aeronautics Research, Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Not Specified,,4/18/2000,,use,

This reliability practice is applied to receivers and transmitters located in the same subsystem and to those installed in different subsystems on the same spacecraft. This early test to identify and resolve radio compatibility problems reduces the risk of uplink/downlink degradation which might threaten mission objectives.",JPL,2/1/1999,"This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1261; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: This practice validates the compatibility of spacecraft receivers and transmitters. If electromagnetic compatibility problems are identified early in radio design, solutions can be developed, implemented, and verified prior to the integration of the hardware on the spacecraft. Implementation Method: The test configuration should simulate the interconnection of the receivers and transmitters in the system, including simulation of the estimated isolation vs. frequency. The tests are also designed to exercise the full tuning range and the full input signal dynamic range specified for the receiver. Performance criteria which are verified include: Absence of ""self-lock,"" where the receiver does not lock to the output signal from its interconnected transmitter. Absence of ""false-lock,"" where the receiver does not lock to a signal other than its receive frequency applied to the receiver input. Absence of frequency ""pushing,"" where the signal input to the receiver changes the frequency of the receiver's voltage-controlled local oscillators. Absence of dynamic range degradation, both at minimum signal (i.e., receiver threshold) and at maximum signal (i.e., receiver saturation), over the entire receive frequency band. The following RF design components are defined prior to testing: Receiver architecture. Transmitter architecture. Subsystem configuration. System configuration. Receiver/transmitter isolation vs. frequency estimates. Characterization and verification of spurious responses and spurious emissions is performed as a set of phased activities: Step 1: Characterize the spurious responses at the input port to the subsystem. The result of this effort will be a plot of response levels in dBmWatts vs. frequency. Note: dBmWatt is defined as: 10 log10 (PIN/1 mW) Step 2: Characterize the spurious emissions at the output port of the subsystem. The result of this effort will be a plot of the emission levels in dB vs. frequency. Step 3: Compare the subsystem spurious response levels with the subsystem spurious emission levels. The emission levels must be substantially lower (a minimum of 9 dB) than the response levels at all frequencies to demonstrate self-compatibility of the RF subsystem. This comparison will produce a plot of the emission vs. response margin in units of dB vs. frequency. Step 4: Translate the emissions of other RF subsystems on the spacecraft as received by the input port of the subsystem being evaluated using the available information on the antenna port-to-port isolation vs. frequency. These translated emissions are then to be compared to the subsystem spurious response characteristics. Again, these translated emission levels must be substantially lower (a minimum of 9 dB) than the subsystem response levels at all frequencies to demonstrate system compatibility. The result of this step will be another plot of the margin in units of dB vs. frequency. Step 5: Translate the susceptibilities of other RF subsystems on the spacecraft to the output port of the subsystem being evaluated using the available information on the antenna port-to-port isolation vs. frequency. These translated susceptibilities are then compared to the subsystem spurious emissions characteristics. These translated response levels must be substantially higher (a minimum of 9dB) than the subsystem emission levels at all frequencies to demonstrate system compatibility. The result of this effort will be yet another plot of the margin in dB vs. frequency. Step 6: The final step is to solve identified problems by filtering the spurious emissions output of each RF subsystem as necessary to restore dB of positive margin below the spurious susceptibility levels. Technical Rationale: Design and development of receivers and transmitters, particularly those located in different subsystems, are often pursued independently. Early identification and resolution of radio compatibility problems requires that the developer: Examine the frequency scheme of each receiver and transmitter on the spacecraft, and identify the known spurious responses and emissions for each. Based on the planned interconnection of each subsystem via the antenna(s), and on the isolation provided between each of the interconnected subsystems, quantify the margin for each subsystem at the input and output ports as a function of frequency. The scheduling of these two activities should be planned to provide time to implement corrective action, such as the addition of RF filters, prior to spacecraft integration. After this time, such solutions become very expensive and pose risks to the spacecraft launch schedule.

Key milestones in the process are Technology Item Screening, the Technology Item Final Design Review, the Integration Design Review, and Hot Fire Testing. Technology Item Final Design Review: Once the technology item is accepted as an output of Technology Item Screening, technology item development proceeds with the conduct of analytical studies, component testing, and the incorporation of design revisions, if required. Then a Technology Item Final Design Review is conducted in which four subject areas are presented and discussed: (1) Technology Item Design Description; (2) Technology Item Design Verification; (3) System Issues; and (4) Safety/Quality Issues. The Technology Item Design Description includes the design configuration and characteristics; the design intent or function; the design requirements; materials and processes, drawings and an integrated design configuration. The Technology Item Design Verification consists of the qualification approach, test and verification plans and results, supporting analysis and assurance that the design and performance meets the intent of the requirements. System Issues include system requirements, system compatibility issues, integration plans and issues, constraints, and Technology Test Bed test operational requirements. Safety/Quality Issues include quality assurance provisions such as fabrication processes and controls, traceability, vendor qualification, and nondestructive evaluation techniques; technology item life; risk assessment; hazards analysis; failure modes and effects analysis; risk mitigation; materials certification; and supporting analyses. When the technology item final design review is successfully completed, fabrication can proceed and readiness certified upon acceptance. Technology Item Integration Design Review: The integration review is conducted to verify that the technology item can be accommodated safely and effectively into the TTB. It consists of: (1) an Integration Design Description; (2) Integrated Design Verification; (3) System Issues, and (4) Safety/Quality Issues. The subject areas covered in the Technology Item Integration Design Review are similar to those for the Technology Item Final Design Review except that all factors are viewed from the standpoint of interaction of the technology item with the Test Bed and its related subsystems, facilities, instrumentation, software and data. Hot Fire Testing and Results: A test plan is prepared for each test series, and it is reviewed at a pretest readiness review before each test. Instrumentation is configured in accordance with an Instrumentation Program and Command List (IP&CL). A test results review is held after each test and a test report is prepared. When two or more tests are combined into a test series, a test series report is prepared. Examples of these documents are included in the list of References for this practice. Technical Rationale: In the conduct and analysis of over fifty tests conducted in the Technology Test Bed program by MSFC since September 1988, the SSME TTB program has proven to be an indispensable tool in the validation of propulsion technology advances for large liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engines. The program has also yielded numerous advances in measurement and diagnostic methods that are continuing to be used in the TTB program and are applicable to other similar test and evaluation scenarios. The TTB's highly instrumented engine employs over five times the number of measurements used for an acceptance test of a flight engine. This in-depth instrumentation using flow meters, steady state pressure transducers, high frequency pressure measurements, thermocouples, strain gauges, accelerometers, and sophisticated laser and optics techniques has provided an unprecedented amount of detailed knowledge of the performance subtleties of large O2/H2 engines under widely varying conditions. The program has yielded results that have permitted the incorporation of state-of-the-art technology advances without compromising engine reliability.

The discontinuities must be open to the material surface.,MSFC,1/31/1999,"This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice number PT-TE-1426 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: Penetrant Testing is a cost effective, nondestructive method for determining cracks, porosity, gouges, laps, seams, and other flaws that are open to the surface of metallics and selected non-metallics. Implementation Method: Liquid penetrant testing is a nondestructive method of detecting surface flaws in solid material and structures. Cracks, porosity, gouges, laps, seams, and other types of flaws can be found using this technique. Penetrant testing is a process in which the liquid penetrant is drawn into small openings by capillary action when it is applied to a surface. After a specified time, excess penetrant is removed from the surface and developer is applied to the surface. The developer absorbs residual penetrant drawn from the flaw leaving a bright-colored penetrant ìbleedingî through the developerís white background giving a clear visual indication of cracks, porosity, and other flaws. There are numerous types and sensitivities of penetrants. The penetrant systems, consisting of penetrant, developer, and cleaner, must be selected for component compatibility and be suitable for use on the test article. In addition to the specific requirements for actual penetrant test, initial surface preparation and final cleaning often requires detailed procedures. Table 1 shows five sensitivity levels for penetrants. Penetrants have been developed for specific applications for ferrous metals, nonferrous metals, glass, polymers and ceramics. The penetrant must also be compatible with the test article to avoid material degradation and possible explosion. For example, the chemical combination of incompatible penetrant materials, the container material, and liquid oxygen, combined with impact or shock, can cause an explosion. Common properties and characteristics of suitable penetrants are listed in Table 2. [D] Table 1. Sensitivity Levels for Penetrants [D] Table 2. Properties and Characteristics of Penetrants There are six basic steps required to perform a penetrant test. These six basic steps are shown in the flow diagram on Figure 1. [D] Figure 1. Penetrant Test Flow Diagram The most common cleaning methods are application of solvents, vapor degreasing, detergent cleaning, steam cleaning and ultrasonic cleaning. Mechanical cleaning using wire brushes, abrasives, emery cloths, or metal scraping are not recommended. However, if mechanical cleaning must be used, light chemical etching is required to reopen any closed flaws. Penetrant testing should be accomplished before any paint or metallic coating is applied since these coatings will close any flaws. The success of penetrant testing depends upon the visibility of flaw indications. To ensure visibility, the penetrant contains either a colored dye easily seen in white light, or a fluorescent dye visible under black (ultraviolet) light. A list of penetrants typically used is listed in reference 4. The penetrant is applied by either dipping, spraying, brushing, or flowing. After penetrant application, a sufficient time (dwell time) is provided to permit the penetrant to permeate the flaw. The manufacturers of penetrants provide the minimum dwell times charts. A typical dwell time chart is shown in Table 3. The penetrant must not be allowed to dry during the dwell time, and must remain wet until the excess penetrant is removed. If penetrant has dried, then the process must be repeated. [D] Table 3. Typical Dwell Time Chart Removal of the penetrant depends upon the type used. The most common methods used are water washable, post emulsified, and solvent removed. Care must be exercised to ensure that the specimen is not over cleaned, thereby removing the penetrant from the flaw. Generally, a developer is required, although some penetrants are formulated for use without a developer. A whitish powder in the developer is very absorbent and acts as a blotter. This blotting action carries the penetrant from the flaw into the powder, forming a flaw pattern. Inspection of the specimen consists of analysis of the patterns on the developer and determining their cause. Inspection may reveal patterns that are either true indications or false indications of a flaw. The true indications are those caused by penetrant bleeding from the actual flaws. Improper cleaning in the initial cleaning step and incomplete removal of the excess penetrant are common causes of false indications. False indications sometimes look like and may hide true indications. If there is doubt about the source of a pattern on the developer, the test should be repeated and the patterns carefully analyzed as they develop. The ability to identify true indications requires much practice. For example, cracks, cold shunts, seams, and forging laps all show up as a continuous line. The same flaws may show up as an intermittent line indicating that the flaw may be partially closed at the surface. Small dots and round indications generally indicate porosity, small inclusions, or blow holes. If the defect is located below the surface, the sensitivity of this method diminishes rapidly with depth. Penetrant inspectors should be qualified and certified in accordance with MIL-STD-410E or SNT-TC-1A. To provide permanent records, photographs of the specimen should be taken prior to post cleaning. Post cleaning is only required of those specimens that are found free of defects. Defects are described by engineering or as specified in MIL-STD-1907. Post inspection cleaning is necessary since the penetrant and developer residue tend to attract moisture, which can cause corrosion or can interfere with subsequent processing or usage. The cleaning methods for post inspection cleaning are generally the same as those recommended for precleaning. Advantages and disadvantages of the penetrant testing method are shown in Table 4. [D] Table 4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Penetrant Testing Method The hazardous properties that should always be considered when using a dye penetrant are liquid flashpoint and toxicity. The flashpoint of penetrant processes can be as low as 40oF to as high as 200oF. The penetrants should be used per manufacturer's instructions. Most penetrants are not actually toxic and do not present a particular hazard in normal use. However, there are precautions that should be followed. Practically all liquid materials used in penetrant, cleaner, and developer have good wetting and detergent properties. Therefore, they exhibit excellent solvent power for fats and oils. These materials, when allowed to contact the skin for an extended period, will dry out the natural oils from the skin, causing it to become rough, red, and if left untreated to eventually crack open, which could cause a severe secondary infection. This is preventable by wearing neoprene-type gloves and aprons, face shield, and protective clothing. If exposed to this skin drying, replenishing the oils on the exposed skin should prevent any cracking. Another hazard with penetrants is the using of dry developers which could be inhaled and become a health hazard. The use of any of the penetrant processes should be performed in a well-ventilated area. If working in a confined area such as a tank, the inspector should have an individual air supply with a full helmet over the head. The black light used when inspecting fluorescent penetrants can cause severe sunburn and damage to the eyes. The blacklight source should always be checked for missing, cracked, or broken filters and repaired before use. Store penetrants in an approved fire container. Technical Rationale: Marshall Space Flight Center has successfully used the penetrant testing method for years. It is a proven method for locating flaws in surface areas of highly stressed areas of components and structures. In addition, it is an effective method for both metallic and nonmetallic materials.

Excessive leakage could ignite in the presence of an ignition source and could result in catastrophic loss of vehicle and crew. Excessive leakage could cause launch delays and result in excessive program cost.,Leak testing is a nondestructive test method that provides the capability to detect and measure the amount of liquid or gas escaping from a sealed pressure system and to locate the individual leaks for possible repair.,MSFC,1/31/1999,"This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice number PT-TE-1424 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: Leak testing of a Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) and a Liquid Oxygen (LO2) propellant system prior to flight insures that the flight leakage rate does not exceed allowable leakage established for flight. Leak testing also insures the quality and reliability of a Space Shuttle Element and reduces the probability of system failure. Leak checks also prove that seals and sealing surfaces at joints are defect free and seals are seated correctly. Implementation Method: A leak is the result of cracks, holes, porosity, permeability, surface aspirates or scratches in a pressurized container or joint that allows the escape of liquid or gas. Leak test methods and procedures are designed for detecting, locating leaks, and ensuring the quality, serviceability and safety of components, structures and the entire propellant system. Leak testing can be a time consuming and expensive task but should be implemented when necessary to protect product integrity or personnel safety. One of the most important steps in leak test development is to establish the specification for acceptable and unacceptable leak rates. Choosing the most effective and reliable leak testing method is also important. Leak testing methods and sensors include the following: Acoustical - escaping gas that is audible or can be detected using acoustical instrumentation. Odor - from tracer gas. Leak test solution - bubbles form when applied over escaping gas. Pressure decay - pressure loss over time. Pressurized liquid - normally water, leakage can be seen. Trace gas - color/radiation/odor. Gas chromatography. Halogen leak detection - requires use of alcohol torch (blue flame) with a sniffer tube when small amounts of fluorine, chlorine bromine, etc. enter the tube then the blue flame turns to a different color. Helium leak detectors - detects leakage of small amounts of helium. Flow meter - detects the volume of gas escaping over a specified time. Bubble gauge - monitors inter seal leakage between primary/secondary when primary pressurized. Light refraction. Mass spectrometer. Hydrogen sensors. Oxygen sensors. Electronic detectors. Liquid sensitive electrical aluminum tape. This reliability Practice covers MSFCís experience for ensuring that the External Tank, as an element of the Space Shuttle Transportation System, has developed an acceptable leak detection system and leakage verification program for the cryogenic propulsion oxidizer and fuel systems, Liquid Oxygen (LO2) and the Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) tanks. EXTERNAL TANK Extra effort is devoted to the procurement of defect-free raw material. Aluminum plate has been ultrasonic tested at the mill. The skin panels are placed into a weld fixture and welded using the variable polarity plasma arc (VPPA) or TIG welding method. After welding, the welds are x-rayed and penetrant inspected (defects are repaired as required). When the LO2 tank has been assembled, the welds are wrapped with an aluminum tape which has an adhesive that is soluble in water. The LO2 tank is then hydrostatically tested. If a leak is encountered during hydrostatic testing, the water will dissolve the adhesive and provide electrical continuity through the aluminum foil tape. A leak could then be isolated and repaired. After the LH2 tank has been assembled, it is pneumatically proof tested with gaseous nitrogen (GN2). Leakage is checked with bubble solution at a reduced pressure after proof test. After the LO2 tank/intertank assembly is joined to the LH2 tank, the propulsion delivery systems are installed on the tanks. The propulsion delivery systems consist of the LO2 and LH2 feed lines, recirculation line and pressurization lines. The propulsion delivery system lines are joined with bolted flanges containing Naflex or Raco/Creavey seals to control leakage. The Raco®/CreaveyTM seal consists of a primary and secondary seal set. The primary seal is a Raco® seal that is a pressure activated seal consisting of a Teflon jacket over an Inconel 718 spring. The secondary seal is a CreaveyTM seal, which is a tubular Teflon cover with a stainless steel spring core that forms an quotOquot ring type seal. For Raco®/CreaveyTM seal arrangement, see Figure 1. This two-seal arrangement provides for means for leak checking the primary seal or the total leak rate of the primary and secondary seals. For the Naflex seal arrangement, see Figure 2. The bolted flanges for both types of seals have a leak test port that has been proved to be blockage free. The allowable leakage rate for the Raco®/CreaveyTM seals is 0.183 SCIM of helium at 50 ± 5.0 PSIG and ambient temperature. The propulsion line mechanical joints are leak checked in final assembly by pressurizing the leak check port to either 6 or 50 PSIG through a flow meter. The LH2 & LO2 tank and propulsion lines are pressurized to 6 PSIG with GN2 and the leakage rate of ìbî nuts and K seals are checked using the leak test solution bubble test (no bubbles in three minutes). [D] Figure 1. Raco ®/Creavey TM Seal Configuration (not to Scale) [D] Figure 2. Naflex Pressure Assisted Seal (Not to Scale) The LO2 and LH2 tanks remain pressurized to 6 PSIG during storage and could stay pressurized for several years. The tank pressure is monitored and if it decays too rapidly action will be taken to find the leak. During the entire ET program, no repairs have been required for flight hardware. Technical Rationale: The rigorous leak check and nondestructive testing on the External Tank program have contributed to more than fifty successful flights of the Space Shuttle. Leak testing methods performed on the ET including bubble solution, water soluble adhesive on aluminum tape, flow meter testing and pressure decay testing. These techniques have proven to be effective in maintaining 100 percent mission success.

Aids in the detection of intermittent or incipient failures in electronic circuitry not otherwise found. This reliability practice benefits even those electronics not powered during launch. Apply service power to electronics assemblies. Monitor as many circuits as possible for intermittent behavior or change in voltage/current level. Record for later analysis the most critical electrical functions. Employ instrumentation such as a storage logic analyzer to monitor relay contacts, especially during pyroshock testing. The NASA and industry practice of powering electronic assemblies during dynamics testing has proven to be effective in uncovering otherwise undetected ""soft"" failures. Studies by the Institute of Environmental Sciences, the U.S. military, Tustin Technological Institute, Hobbes Engineering, and others have all arrived at the same general conclusion: power-on vibration is a valuable tool for exposing latent defects in electronic hardware with the eventual resultant improvement in product quality. Intermittencies in electronic circuitry can often be detected during vibration but may not be observed under ambient functional testing. These intermittencies may not reappear until after launch, where they sometimes degenerate into hard failures. Examples of these intermittencies include: Component shorts due to internal conductive particles, Loose or contaminated connectors, Fractured component-to-board solder joints, Electrical arcing, Data number changes in digital equipment, and Relay transfer or chatter. Powering of electronic equipment during vibration allows for detection of failures or intermittent conditions when they occur. This can be extremely useful in diagnosing the problem and formulating corrective action. In vibration, it is advantageous to know in what environment, level, axis, and time the anomaly occurred. Also, this procedure allows a test to be discontinued at the time the anomaly occurs to avoid the potential for further damage.","This practice has been used on the Mariner series, Viking, Voyager, Magellan and Galileo programs.",,,"Aeronautics Research, Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Not Specified,,4/14/2000,,use,

By initially selecting a 9 Db margin, the probability of complying with the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) specification during system test is high. Implementation Method: Radiated and conducted emission specifications established for the customer are based on overall theoretical requirements which will meet the system specifications. The following design practices for subsystems allow for measurement error, combined effects, and manufacturing tolerance. This assures that an adequate margin will be realized when the final system performance is evaluated. In those cases where an outside agency imposes the allowable emissions levels, the included margins must be taken into consideration so that excessive constraints are not applied. When a specific requirement is identified as a major cost driver for design, margin allocations should be reviewed for possible relief. Conducted Emissions: Out-of-specification conducted emission on power, control, and signal lines can usually be controlled by a low-pass filter to reduce or eliminate unnecessary high-order harmonics. On digital circuits, a compromise must be made between the need for square pulses and the suppression of high-order harmonics. Radiated Emissions: Radiated emission can be reduced by cancellation, cross polarization, or by either magnetic or electric field shielding. In some cases, radiated emission can be reduced by using a balanced design so that the external magnetic or electric fields are cancelled or cross-polarized at a particular sensor. Shielding can be added if the additional weight can be tolerated. Otherwise, increasing the separation distance between the emitter and a sensor may be adequate. Low frequency magnetic and electric field emissions must consider the inverse cube relation between amplitude and the separation between source and sensor in order to determine an adequate separation. Technical Rationale: By allowing a 9 Db margin at the design phase, there is sufficient tolerance to provide a high degree of confidence that the equipment will pass the system EMC tests. 9 Db is needed to account for the differences between idealized theory and practice plus the test margin. The test margin covers both manufacturing tolerance and measurement tolerance.","This practice has been used on Voyager, Magellan, Galileo, and Ocean Topographic Experiment (TOPEX).",,,"Aeronautics Research, Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Not Specified,,4/6/2000,,use,

Benefit: Reliable materials can be selected for aerospace applications by choosing those materials that have demonstrated reliability in carefully controlled laboratory testing and in operational space flights. Use of the Materials and Processes Technical Information System (MAPTIS) data base by system designers will ensure that materials that have demonstrated reliable performance in flight and test experience are the first to be considered in new or revised designs. Engineers will then have the confidence in their selections, knowing that the data on which their decisions have been made have been thoroughly validated. Implementation Method: Introduction: The Materials and Processes Technical Information System (MAPTIS) resides on a DEC Alpha 7620 Computer located at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. It can be accessed through the Internet after assignment of an account number by completing a user request form which can be obtained from MSFC. The MAPTIS data base contains properties and test histories on both metals and nonmetals. Searches of the database can be accomplished by material code, material specification, manufacturer, or by a string or phrase search. Materials are rated based on criteria in NASA Handbook 8060.1C [reference 1] , Marshall Space Flight Center Specification 250 [reference 2] , Marshall Space Flight Center Specification 522 [reference 3] , and SP-R022A [reference 4] . For metals, information is included in the database on corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, and compatibility with: (1) gaseous oxygen, (2) liquid oxygen, (3) nitrogen tetroxide, (4) hydrazine, (5) low pressure hydrogen (<450 psi) and (6) high pressure hydrogen (>450 psi). In addition MAPTIS contains: a material code index, an alloy designation, the heat treatment, material specifications, and the generic identification and form. The database elements for nonmetals includes information on flammability, toxicity, thermal vacuum stability, and compatibility with: (1) liquid oxygen, (2) gaseous oxygen, (3) nitrogen tetroxide, (4) hydrazine, (5) liquid hydrogen, and (6) hydraulic fluid. Nonmetallic data is included for adhesives, elastomers, plastics, tapes, tubing, potting compounds, coatings and lubricants. Material Selection: The materials selection portion of MAPTIS is a design selection tool that can also be used for material surveys and design reviews. It is based on comprehensive storage of test data and handbook information on metals, nonmetals, and standard parts. It includes a thermal vacuum stability data base which is a compilation of vacuum outgassing data from tests conducted at MSFC and various other organizations including the White Sands Test Facility, the Goddard Space Flight Center, the European Space Agency, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and others. Data elements included are total mass loss, residual mass loss, volatile condensible material, pressure, temperature, duration, and test facility description. An atomic oxygen data base includes the effects of atomic oxygen on various materials, guidelines for selection of materials based on this parameter, and protective techniques. A special database included in MAPTIS is an analytical tool to evaluate toxic outgassing data. The analysis provides a method for determining if the material or the assembled article meets the requirements of NHB 8060.1C acceptance criteria including the comparison of projected contaminant concentrations with maximum allowable concentrations. The material selection function is a vital part of achieving high reliability for long duration space missions or missions on which the materials encounter severe environments. Material Properties: The material properties portion of MAPTIS contains comprehensive online materials information including physical and mechanical properties. Materials are listed specifically by designation, trade name, and manufacturer. The metallic materials portion includes such information as mechanical properties, design allowables, variations with environment and temperature, graphical and tabular tensile and compressive yield and ultimate strengths, elongation, fatigue, stress-strain, and elastic modulus. Physical properties such as density and thermal expansion are also included, as are chemical, thermal, and electrical properties. Many of these same properties are also included for nonmetals with additional information on peel, tear, and impact resistance; lap shear, creep, and resilience. Physical and chemical properties such as viscosity, hardness, color, formulation, flashpoint, chemical and environmental resistance, and pH are included in the data base. For nonmetals, processing parameters such as extrusion or molding temperatures, pressures, and times; cure conditions, mix ratios, rise, and demold times are also included. The types of materials contained in the nonmetals portion of the database are: plastics, nozzle materials, coatings, tapes, adhesives, and lubricants. Verification and Control: The MAPTIS is also used to obtain information on where the materials listed have been used, to determine the history of hardware and material selection rationale, and to correlate U.S. material designations with those of foreign material designations. The ""where used"" data aids in the identification, tracking, and control of all material usage as a function of part number, environment, contractor, and/or project. This information is available for the SRM/SRB, External Tank, Space Shuttle Main Engine, and Spacelab programs. The data includes configuration information, application information, materials usage information, and support information. Configuration information includes the associate contractor, the detailed drawing numbers and part numbers, and the next assembly drawing and part numbers for the device, part, or structure that used or uses the material. Application information includes test data, fluid systems compatibility, environmental conditions to which the item(s) have been subjected, evaluation and analysis rationale, and process specifications. Materials usage and support information includes: (1) all materials by designation, code, and specification; (2) an overall material evaluation rating; (3) a record of the weight, surface area, and thickness of nonmetals; (4) a record of material usage agreements; and (5) material specifications. These success stories of materials which performed in an acceptable manner in real programs, as well as in laboratory tests, are indispensable inputs to the aerospace designer. Structural Materials Failure Analysis Database: It is not only the success stories that are important inputs to the designer, but also an in-depth knowledge of the failures that have occurred and why they occurred is another vital link to high reliability. The NASA-wide failure analysis data base for structural materials is also a part of MAPTIS. It provides fast and easy access to selected NASA and contractor reports on failure investigations for structural materials and processes that have been conducted over a period of 35 years. The database fulfills the stated requirements of personnel surveyed at NASA centers, the Department of Defense, and contractors who need to be able to retrieve data quickly, cross reference large quantities of technical information, and share results in a standard format between organizations. The database presents failure analysis information in a simple format. It is used by engineers and managers to get a head start on investigations, minimize duplications of effort, use resources effectively, and ensure that problems have been resolved or can be avoided. There are approximately 900 records in the database at this writing, and the information is continuing to be updated and amended as new information becomes available. The database has nine identifying data fields plus an abstract averaging about 100 words to describe the nature of the failure, its cause, and corrective actions. Failures are categorized into 15 categories as follows: Critical Defect Growth Corrosion Fatigue Corrosion Creep High Cycle Fatigue Hydrogen Embrittlement Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement Low Cycle Fatigue Liquid Metal Embrittlement Overload Oxidation Stress Assisted Grain Boundary Oxidation Crack Stress Corrosion Cracking Stress Rupture Other Knowledge of the types of structural failures that have been encountered, the details of the failure analysis, and the corrective actions taken are essential elements in the material selection for systems which must perform reliably. Project Support Data Base: MAPTIS contains a project support data base designed for both external and internal support to the major ongoing NASA and MSFC projects. The project support data base includes an electronic bulletin board, lead engineer data records, a standards data base, specifications status, and correspondence status. The electronic bulletin board provides a method for rapid dissemination and exchange of materials and processes news, developments, and problems NASA-wide. Lead Engineers are listed for each project. A standards data base lists all NASA specifications and standards. The specifications tracking data file provides evaluation or approval status, disposition, description and effectivity for material and process specifications, operations, and procedures reviewed and evaluated by MSFCís Materials and Processes Laboratory. Technical Rationale: Historically, materials and their properties have been inextricably tied to the ability to withstand severe environments and to provide hardware that will operate successfully in multiple missions. An intimate knowledge of the materials, their composition, their reaction under various operating conditions, and their success and failure history will provide the designer with the ability to select the right material for any given task. MAPTIS contains an accumulated body of data and evidence that has been documented over many years and perfected into an electronic access system that is still being updated and growing. Use of this system has become an essential element in the continuing pursuit of the ultimate in reliable space flight systems.

Some of this damage will require replacement of components during the integration and test program whereas other damage can result in early failures during the mission.,"Use proven GSFC practices during the integration and testing of flight hardware to prevent electrical and mechanical overstressing of flight hardware parts and components, thereby, assuring that the ""designed in"" reliability is not compromised.",GSFC,2/1/1999,"This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice Number PT-TE-1429 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. These practices prevent the long term degradation and early failure of electrical parts and components due to electrical and mechanical overstressing. Damage due to overstressing may not result in immediate failure and may not be detected by component or assembly level testing but can result in early failures. Implementation: Formal Electrical Integration Procedures are prepared, reviewed, and approved to document and control the step by step procedures used in mating, testing, integrating, etc. of flight hardware at all levels of assembly. A number of practices are incorporated into these procedures to prevent electrical and mechanical overstressing of electrical parts and components. These practices are described in the following: Safe-To-Mate Cable Harness Test: This test is performed on flight cables and harnesses prior to their connection to flight hardware. A breakout box is inserted at one end of the cable. Power and signal flow, continuity, isolation, etc. are tested through the entire cable. This test checks for wiring errors that could apply over-voltages, reverse polarities, improper signals, etc. that could cause electrical stress to parts and components. Safe-To-Mate Cable And Simulator Test: This test is performed on cables and harnesses connected to simulators prior to their connection to flight hardware, A breakout box is inserted at the flight unit end of the cable or harness. Power and signal flow, continuity, isolation, etc. is tested through the entire cable or harness. This test checks for wiring errors in both the simulator and the cable that could apply over-voltages, reverse polarities, improper signals, etc. that could cause electrical stress to parts and components. Disconnect Meters Before Changing Range Scales: Meter probe connections to flight hardware and to GSE when connected to flight hardware are disconnected and grounded during meter range switching in order to drain off electrostatic charges and voltage transients that may develop during the range switching. Ground Cable and Harness Connectors Before Mating: Cable and harness connector shells are grounded before mating with flight hardware in order to drain-off electrostatic charges. Verify Ground Connections: The resistance of ground connections between flight hardware boxes and packages and between flight boxes and packages and structure ground are verified by measurement and must be no greater than 2.5 milliohms. Verify Power-off Before Mating Or Demating Connectors: Power-off is verified for ground support and test equipment and for flight hardware before signal and power connectors are mated or demated with flight hardware. This is to prevent transients and partial and intermittent connections that could occur during the connection process. Ground Scaffolding and Workstands: Scaffolding and workstands located near flight hardware are grounded to a central ground point to prevent electrostatic buildup and discharges to the flight hardware. Painting of scaffolding and workstands is not permitted in order to prevent electrostatic charge buildup on the painted surfaces that can be transferred to the flight hardware. Paint also prevents proper ground connections to the scaffolding and workstands. Unroll Tapes Slowly: Tapes used on or around flight hardware are unrolled slowly in front of an ionized air source if available in order to prevent electrostatic charge buildup and discharges to the flight hardware. Connector Savers: Connector savers are used on those flight connectors where frequent mates and demates are required during the integration and test program. The connector savers minimize the wear and stress on the connector pins due to frequent mate and demate procedures. Connector Demate Tools: Connector demate tools are used to demate flight connectors in order to minimize stress on flight connector pins. Log of Flight Connector Mates And Demates: A log of all flight connector mates and demates is maintained and monitored in order to access the impact on the connectors of the mates and demates and to facilitate cleaning of connector pins every 10 mate and demate operations. Secure Flight Cables To Connectors: Flight Cables are secured to the back of connectors with strain relief clamps or by potting in order to minimize strain at the connector pins and wire crimp areas. Check Cable Assemblies For Sharp Edges: Cable assemblies are carefully checked for sharp edges that could cut into or nick wire insulation and flight components and boxes during installation and handling and could cause a failure at a later date. Typically, these sharp edges are caused by the aluminum foil wrapped around cables for EMI shielding purposes. Abrasiveness Of Cable Harnesses On Flight Structure: Cable harnesses are designed and installed on flight structures so as to prevent abrasions on the structure and on flight boxes and parts. Abrasions can be caused by moving parts, handling during integration and test activities, insufficient bending radiuses, etc. Harness Flexing Across Hinged Joints: Harnesses across hinged joints are designed for the number of planned operations of the joint and also for an appropriate number of additional operations of the joint that could be required during the integration and test activities. Protection Of Flight Cables And Harnesses: Flight cables and harnesses are appropriately stored and protected from stress and damage until they are installed. This is to ensure that damage to cables and harnesses will not lead to early failures. Quality And Protection of GSE Cables: GSE and test cables are fabricated to good quality standards and are protected from damage to prevent failures that could result in stress to and early failures of flight hardware. This includes appropriate separation of power, signal , and ground wires to minimize cross coupling of signals and transients that could stress electrical parts and result in early failures. Technical Rationale: Electrical components in flight hardware can be very susceptible to damage due to overvoltages including transients and electrostatic buildups and discharges, application of voltages in the reverse polarity, application of improper signals etc. Flight connectors can be degraded and damaged by excessive and improper mates and demates. The damages can be so severe that the performance is affected and the faulty part can be identified and replaced during the integration and test program. However, in many cases the damage is not immediately apparent and can begin a process of gradual degradation to failure during the mission life of the hardware in space. The above practices have been adopted to prevent the damaging influences that can cause the degradation of components and the loss of reliable operation during the flight mission.",This practice has been used on all GSFC Flight Programs,,,"Aeronautics Research, Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Not Specified,,3/31/2000,,use,

A system maintenance concept should be developed to define the basis for establishing maintainability requirements and to support design in the system conceptual phase. The maintenance concept provides the practical basis for design, layout, and packaging of the system and its equipment. The number of problems associated with product support and maintenance of space systems can be reduced, if not eliminated, by applying the principles prescribed in the system's maintenance concept.","Develop a maintenance concept early in the program life cycle to provide a basis for full maintainability support. It should be used to influence systems design to ensure that attributes for ease of maintenance, minimization of repair and down time, and logistics support will be present in the final design.",GRC,11/30/1994,"This Lesson Learned is based on Maintainability Technique Number PM-3 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4628, Recommended Techniques for Effective Maintainability. Effective development of a maintenance concept can enhance the effectiveness of maintenance support planning and aid both logistics planning and design of a maintainable system. The maintenance concept can also provide assessments of cost savings for maintenance activities and resources allowable at each maintenance level. The maintenance concept provides the basis for overall maintainability design requirements for the program, and contains detailed planning of maintenance policy for the operational system. It establishes the scope of maintenance responsibility for each level (echelon) of maintenance and the personnel resources (maintenance manning and skill levels) required to maintain a space system. Early development and application of the maintenance concept in structuring the maintainability plan can eliminate or reduce occurrence of problems that may interrupt system operation. The maintenance concept for a new system must be systematically formulated during the early conceptual design phase of a program to minimize maintenance problems during the operational phase. This proactive approach is being used on Space Station-based experiment development programs at LeRC to incorporate current Space Station Program support principles, prescribed Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) and Combustion Module One (CM-1) operational and repair policy, and identified sparing requirements. Elements This maintenance concept will aid in logistics planning and will guide design by providing the basis for establishment of maintenance support requirements in terms of tasks to be performed, frequency of maintenance, preventive and corrective maintenance downtime, personnel numbers and skill levels, test and support equipment, tools, repair items, and information. Inputs to the maintenance concept should include: a mission profile, system reliability and availability requirements, overall size and weight constraints, and crew considerations. The concept should support the following design elements as they apply to a manned orbital space program where on-orbit and ground maintenance is planned. Repair Policy The repair policy should consider the support to be provided at the maintenance echelons (levels) summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Echelons of Maintenance Organizational Maintenance Depot Maintenance Where Performed On-orbit NASA Center or Contractor System Maintainer Flight Crew Center Engineers and Technicians Basis Repair and retain equipment Repair and return equipment to stock inventory Type of work accomplished Inspect equipment Repair at module, ORU, and component level Remove and replace modules and ORU's Repair and maintain ground support equipment Adjust equipment Calibrate equipment Organizational Maintenance Organizational maintenance is maintenance performed by the using organization (e.g., flight crew) on its own equipment. This maintenance consists of functions and repairs within the capabilities of authorized personnel, skills, tools, and test equipment. Organizational level personnel are generally occupied with the operation and use of the equipment, and have minimum time available for detailed maintenance or diagnostic checkout; consequently, the maintenance at this level is restricted to periodic checks of equipment performance. Cleaning of equipment, front panel adjustments, and the removal and replacement of certain plug-in modules and Orbital Replaceable Units (ORUs), referred to as black boxes, are removed and forwarded to the Depot Level. Depot Maintenance Depot maintenance is maintenance performed at NASA Centers or contractor facilities for completely overhauling and rebuilding the equipment as well as to perform highly complex maintenance actions. The support includes tasks to repair faulty equipment to the part level, if deemed necessary. This level of maintenance provides the necessary standards for equipment calibration purposes, and also serves as the major supply for spares. System Availability Operational Availability (Ao ) is defined as the probability that at an arbitrary point in time, the system is operable, i.e., is quotup.quot It is a function of the frequency of maintenance, active maintenance time, waiting time, logistics time, administrative time, and the ready time of the system, and is expressed as: [D] (1) Where: UPTIME = the total time a system is in an operable state, and TOTAL TIME = the combination of uptime and downtime, in which downtime is the time in which a system spends in an inoperable state. Repair vs. Replacement Policy Normally, on-orbit repair should not be performed on any plug-in modules or ORUs. If any on-orbit repair actions are planned, they should be clearly identified in the concept. At the organizational level, failed items should be either discarded or sent to the NASA Center or contractor for exchange and repair in accordance with repair/discard policies identified in the system requirements. Corrective maintenance, limited to replacement of faulty ORUs and plug-in modules, should be specified to be performed during the mission period. Prime equipment should be designed to have ready access for maintenance. Quick-opening fasteners should also be specified. Level of Replacement The design for proper level of ORU definition should consider compatible failure rates for hardware parts within the same ORU. Relative ranking of ORU's through reliability and maintainability considerations and mission criticality analysis can also contribute toward the proper level of replacement definitions. The required level of replacement should be specified at the plug-in module and ORU levels. Maintenance and support of a system should involve two-tier maintenance echelons. The first level provides for repair of the end- item on-orbit by replacing select faulty or defective plug-in modules and ORUs identified through use of specified diagnostic procedures. Faulty ORUs should then be evacuated to the second level of the maintenance echelon (depot level), which will be at a NASA Center for repair if deemed necessary. The particular NASA center/ facility should act as the depot for repair of faulty items. Skill Level Requirements Hardware should be designed to aid on-orbit and ground maintenance, inspection, and repair. Special skills should not be required to maintain a system. The following design features should be incorporated: Plug-in module and ORU design to minimize installation/removal time and requirements for hand tools, special tools, and maintenance skills. Plug-in modules and ORUs should be designed for corrective maintenance by removal and replacement. Plug-in module and ORU designs requiring preventive maintenance should be optimized with respect to the access, maintenance hours, and maintenance complexity. Software and its associated hardware should be designed so that software revisions/corrections can be easily installed on-orbit with minimum skill level requirements. Flight crew training for payload flight operation should identify hands-on crewmember training, at the NASA center where the system is built, to familiarize crewmembers with the removal/replacement of hardware. Spares Philosophy Two basic types of spares should be required to support a maintainable system: development spares and operational spares. Development spares are those that must be identified and acquired to support planned system test activities, integration, assembly, check-out and production. Operational spares are those spares that must be acquired to support on-going operations on-orbit. The quantity of development spares required for each system, and the total quantities to sustain the required availability during the planned test activities, integration, assembly, and check-out test should be determined according to the following: Custom-made components/parts Long-lead time items The quantity of spares required for each system and the total quantities to sustain the required operational availability on-orbit should be determined according to the following: Items that are critical to system operation Items that have high failure rate Items that have limited life In the initial spares provisioning period and to the maximum extent practical, spares should be purchased directly from the actual manufacturer; i.e., lowest-tier subcontractor, to eliminate the layers of support costs at each tier. The initial provisioning period should cover early test and evaluation, plus a short period of operation, to gain sufficient operational experience with the system. This will provide a basis for fully competitive acquisition of spares. Spares with limited shelf life should be identified and should be acquired periodically to ensure that adequate quantities of spares are available when needed. Spares with expired shelf lives should be removed and replaced. Procurement of spares should be initiated in sufficient advance of need to account for procurement lead time (administrative and production lead time). The location of the spares inventory (on- orbit and on-ground) should be a function of the on-orbit stowage allocation capabilities and requirements. A volume/weight analysis should be conducted to determine the quantity and types of spare items necessary to sustain satisfactory operational availability. The volume/weight analysis shall assure available or planned payload volume and weight limits, and planned or available on-board stowage area. Breakout should be addressed during initial provisioning and throughout the replenishment process in accordance with NMI 5900.1, Reference 1. Breakout is the spares procurement directly from the original equipment manufacturer, prime contractor, or other source, whichever proves most cost-effective. A spare item requirement list should be maintained by procurement and technical personnel. Diagnostic/Testing Principles and Concepts The system should meet the following failure detection requirements as a minimum: The system should have the capability to detect, isolate and support the display of failures to the plug-in module level. Crew observations may be used as a method of failure detection of the following: visual displays, keyboards/buttons, general lighting, speakers. System design should provide the capability for monitoring, checkout, fault detection, and isolation to the on-orbit repairable level without requiring removal of items. Manual override and/or inhibit capability for all automatic control functions should be provided for crew safety and to simplify checkout and troubleshooting. All failures of the system should be automatically detected and enunciated either to the flight crew or the ground crew. Accesses and covers should be devoid of sharp corners/edges and be equipped with grasp areas for safe maintenance activities. Systems/subsystems/items should be designed to be functionally, mechanically, electrically, and electronically as independent as practical to facilitate maintenance. The concept should also describe operating/testing techniques to identify problems and consider the complexity of the various types of items in the space system and associated maintenance personnel skills (for all software, firmware, or hardware). The techniques will identify maintenance problems. In all cases of fault simulation, the safety of personnel and potential damage to system/equipment should be evaluated in the concept. The concept should request that a safety fault tree analysis be the basis for determining simulation. Also, a Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis should be used to evaluate and determine fault simulation. Some of the fundamental maintenance actions to be evaluated, monitored, and recorded are as follows: Preparation and visual inspection time Functional check-out time Diagnostic time: fault locate and fault isolate Repair time: gain access, remove and replace, adjust, align, calibrate, and close access Clean, lubricate, service time Functional check-out of the repair action Responsibilities for Contractor Maintenance The prime contractor's maintainability program should provide controls for assuring adequate maintenance of purchased hardware. Such assurance is achieved through the following: Selection of subcontractors from the standpoint of demonstrated capability to produce a maintainable product. Development of adequate design specifications and test requirements for the subcontractor-produced product. Development of proper maintainability requirements to impose on each subcontractor. Close technical liaison with the subcontractor (both in design and maintainability areas) to minimize communication problems and to facilitate early identification and correction of interface or interrelation design problems. Continuous review and assessment to assure that each subcontractor is implementing his maintainability program effectively. Responsibilities for Payload Maintenance Director of field installations responsible for launch preparation, maintenance, or repair activities should be responsible for maintenance planning and for providing the resources necessary to support the efficient identification of maintenance related problems in accordance with system requirements. These responsibilities include: Implementing a system that will identify, track, and status problems related to routine maintenance activities attributable to the design characteristics of flight hardware and software. Providing information for use in a data collection system to improve the accuracy of quantitative maintainability and availability estimates. This information can be used to identify failure trends influencing reliability growth characteristics during design and to communicate quotlessons learnedquot from ground maintenance experience. Recommending to the Program Manager, responsible for design and development of flight hardware/software, areas for design improvement to increase the efficiency in ground processing or maintenance operations. The rationale for supporting these recommendations should include factors such as reduction in ground turnaround time and operational support costs. Allocation of Crew Time for Maintenance Actions Crew time for maintenance should be identified in accordance with system complexity, reliability, and criticality of the items to the system and mission requirements. Analytical methods exist which can be used to prioritize and allocate crew time for maintenance actions.

Benefit: Adherence to this Guideline gives confidence that mechanisms will operate successfully during flight. The design phase analytical methods and results are verified. Testing determines margins to show by how much the design requirements are exceeded and pinpoints potential problem areas. Experience gained from failures and anomalies during testing help prevent recurrence in future programs. Implementation Method: In order to realize the benefits of a deployable appendages test program, the following steps should be taken: Use the design requirements for the hardware to be tested to generate a list of tests that will verify that each requirement will be met. This list should include how many times each test must be conducted, and the pass/fail criteria for each test. From this list, determine which tests can be combined to save time and costs. Select the critical design parameters for which test values and margins are to be measured. Decide what facilities and equipment will be needed for the tests. Design, analyze, fabricate, and check out any new items needed. Determine what personnel will be required for each test. Put together an overall schedule of tests, paying particular attention to the logistics of personnel, facilities, and material needed for each test. Use the results of the previous steps to write a comprehensive test plan. Follow the plan to set up and conduct the tests, then perform data reduction and analysis. Write up the results of the tests in one or more test reports. Correct deficiencies revealed in testing and re-test to verify the modified configuration. Technical Considerations: To realize all the benefits, the test program should include: Thorough testing to qualify the design and correlate the design analysis. Acceptance criteria must be established prior to the start of testing. Testing at greater extremes (temperatures, vacuum, loads) than expected during flight to determine margins. Testing of flight-like hardware to prove designs. Testing of actual flight hardware to prove workmanship and determine values of specific design parameters. Comprehensive part and component testing, to lessen the risk of failure at subsystem and system program phases, when such failures are very costly. Parts and components include: Bearings Springs Dampers Motors, gear trains Switches, position indicators Testing of subsystems (such as drive assemblies, hinge assemblies, gimbals, etc.) should include the following general tests: Mass properties Component interfaces System interface Subsystem performance verification (including margins) Subsystem strength verification Subsystem life, including lubricant/lubricant systems Thermal vacuum EMI/EMC Magnetic Vibration/acoustics Specific subsystem tests should include (where applicable): Restraint/release assembly tests Hinge assembly tests Drive assembly tests (solar array-antenna) Gimbal assembly tests System tests of complete deployable appendages should include: System tests should match flight configuration as closely as possible. Where practical, full deployment testing in simulated zero-G environment, including release, deployment, and lock-in. Deployment in thermal-vacuum is preferable, but generally impractical. Vibro/acoustic testing of the system in launch configuration should precede full deployment testing. Parameters to measure (where applicable) should include: Deployment time, release to lock-in Motor current Stiffness stowed and deployed Alignment Envelope of motion during deployment Electrical integrity of cables across hinges and gimbals Release shock Velocity at end of travel Torque margins System life, if applicable In-depth investigation of all anomalies. Test facilities include: Design and Analysis - deployment testing of large appendages usually requires special, tailor-made facilities to simulate actual flight conditions as closely as possible, and to perform special engineering tests. Such hardware includes: G-negation devices Inertial load simulators Thermal control devices capable of producing temperature levels and gradients Fixtures for environmental tests Fixtures for conducting stiffness measurements, modal tests, etc. Facility Design Parameters Simulation of mechanical and electrical launch configuration interfaces Space available for full deployment Type , number, size, and location of g-negation supports Weight, size, cost, manufacturability of fixtures Transportability of fixtures, if required Analysis Parameters Load carrying capacity of fixtures Effect of fixtures on measured data Pre-test predictions and establishment of pass/fail criteria Pre-test Environmental test fixtures must be calibrated and safety tested in actual facility prior to use Technical Rationale: Testing of deployable appendages for spacecraft differs somewhat from the testing of other space hardware. It involves special considerations for dealing with large, cumbersome devices that usually require some degree of manual handing after each operation. Since ground testing is done in a 1-g environment, a complex facility is usually required for simulating the zero-g space condition (g-negation device). This guideline covers the complete test program for spacecraft deployable appendages, including the general tests that also pertain to other space hardware, and the tests specifically pertinent to deployable appendages.

This increases the potential availability and reliability of the primary string.,JPL,1/31/1999,"This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice Number PD-ED-1246 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefits: Fault tolerant design provides a means to achieve a balanced project risk where the cost of failure protection is commensurate with the program resources and the mission criticality of the equipment. By providing compensation for potential hardware failures, a fault tolerant design approach may achieve reliability objectives without recourse to non-optimized redundancy or overdesign. Implementation Method: The practice of fault tolerant design (FTD) presumes that the potential causes of failures are identifiable. This identification is performed by means of the existing practices of hardware and software failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA). Similarly, fault tree analysis (FTA) identifies safety issues and potential faults in mechanical and electromechanical devices. Design engineers utilize the preliminary results of FMECAs and FTAs to establish fault tolerant equipment design priorities. FTD is an iterative process; its current validity relies on the current iteration of the FMECA and FTA and their corresponding criticalities and probabilities of occurrence. The iteration cycle ceases when either the cost of the next design iteration is programmatically unacceptable or when the risk has been reduced below a stated goal. It is assumed that all of the normal reliability design tools such as part stress derating, worst case performance analysis, qualification testing, life demonstration, quality control, etc., have already been used to preclude any design or material deficiencies. The FTD process also assumes that, in spite of the above practices, an in-flight failure may occur in a given set of manufactured hardware. This process flow is illustrated in Figure 1. The diagram illustrates that FTD is a top-level system design philosophy covering other NASA preferred reliability practices, including analytical design disciplines, FMECA and FTA studies, fault protection plans, and test results. The FTD process at JPL includes four phases beginning with analytical design. [D] Technical Rationale: To increase the reliability of a spacecraft system, two complementary but fundamentally different approaches are taken: Fault prevention (fault intolerance), and Fault tolerance. Fault prevention deals with the objective of increasing reliability by elimination of all faults, which is not feasible in reality. Therefore, the goal of fault prevention is to reduce the probability of system failure to an acceptably low value. The fault tolerance approach expects failures to occur. However, their effects will be automatically counteracted by incorporating either redundancy or other types of compensation. A fault tolerant design approach differs from a pure design redundancy approach in that provisions are made for planned degraded modes of operation where acceptable. For example, the high gain antenna of a spacecraft is usually non-redundant because of its size. An FTD would favor the use of a backup medium gain antenna operating at reduced data rates as a degraded but acceptable operating mode. Similarly, a partially failed power source within a solar panel array or a failure of one of three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) could be accommodated: an appropriate failure detection circuit and a software fault protection algorithm would be provided to shed low priority electrical loads or instruments, while maintaining most mission capabilities. Also, FTD may be preferable to mere hardware redundancy in that higher probability multiple failures can be identified and accommodated. For example, the common design practice for inertial sensors (gyros) is the use of three packages of orthogonally located dual axis sensors (i.e., the X-Y, Y-Z, and Z-X axes). This scheme is tolerant of the loss of any one gyro but can be extended to accommodate the loss of any two gyros by the use of a pair of two-axis positionally adjustable gyros insertable by command or by detection algorithms. It can be placed in the X-Y or X-Z directions, thereby providing at least one signal on each axis even if two pairs of fixed mounted gyros are lost. In this case, dual failures are accommodated with only a short interruption of service and some additional mechanical complexity, but with no significant loss in system performance. The essential ingredients to achieving a fault tolerant design are the performance of a thorough FMECA and FTA, the detailed communication of these identified failure modes and effects to the fault protection design engineers, and strong participation by the project engineer and program management in assessing design cost/benefit trade-off iterations. An FTD will be limited by either weight, volume, schedule, or cost constraints. Presentation of fault tolerant design options to program management requires a skilled engineering team with intimate knowledge of system operation and close communication with system designers. An FTD can provide dramatic improvements in system reliability and lead to a substantial reduction in flight failures as a consequence of fewer disabling system failures.

Benefit: Leak-free joints can be achieved in cryogenic lines, joints, valves, and pumps for launch vehicles through the use of proven, state-of-the-art static cryogenic seals. These seals adapt to wide ranges of temperature and continue to seal when subjected to high pressures, in-flight static stresses, and in-flight dynamic loads. Implementation Method: 1. Introduction: Low or zero fluid or gas leakage in flight and ground-based cryogenic systems can be achieved through meticulous joint design and testing, selection of the proper seal configuration and materials, thorough cleaning and inspection of seal and flange surfaces, carefully controlled installation, and carefully controlled fastener tightening procedures. The most widely used and successful cryogenic seal for NASA space flight applications has been the deflection actuated, pressure assisted coated metal seal. High nickel content steel alloys coated with a thin layer of Teflon® or plated with gold, silver, indium, palladium, lead, copper, nickel, or aluminum have provided good sealing properties at elevated as well as cryogenic temperatures. This practice covers experience with pressure assisted and spring energized cryogenic seals in the SSME and ET. Experience was derived from earlier programs (Saturn I and Saturn V) to develop these effective seals. Although the subject of this practice is cryogenic seals, the pressure assisted and spring energized seals described are also effective over the broad temperature ranges from liquid hydrogen (-423 deg.F) to hot gas (1000/1200 deg.F). 2. Nonspacer Type, Deflection Activated, Pressure Assisted Seals [D] The nonspacer type seal shown in Figure 1, fits into a groove in the flange. It can be used with a separate spacer to eliminate the need for a seal groove, but a retaining groove is preferred. As shown in Figure 1, these seals have two sealing surfaces that mate with adjoining flanges. Diameters range from 0.55quot to 16.75quot as used in the SSME. Cross sections of the seal ring vary from 0.200quot x 0.164quot to 0.150quot x 0.120quot in radial width and installed length, respectively, and the seals can be made in other diameters and other cross-sectional configurations. They are found throughout the SSME in both cryogenic and hot gas applications. The seals are machined from high nickel alloy steel and coated with either silver or silver with rhodium overcoat. The silver coated seals have a temperature range of -423 deg.F to +1000 deg.F, while the silver with rhodium can be used over a -423 deg.F to +1200 deg.F range. The seals are used in both fuel and oxidizer systems. In installing both the nonspacer type and the spacer type seals, the seals are compressed during joint assembly, which provides a load at the sealing circumference to effect sealing at low pressures. As the pressure increases, it acts on the internal surfaces of the seal, increasing the force on the seal tips to augment sealing capability as pressure increases. The seal coating presses into the flange surfaces, filling microscopic asperities and irregularities in the flange sealing surfaces. The combination of the installation deflection and the pressure on the internal surfaces permits the sealing faces to compensate for joint separation under system pressure and for shrinkage during exposure to cryogenic temperatures. 3. Spacer Type, Deflection Activated, Pressure Assisted Seals [D] This type of seal was originally used on the Saturn program and was later adapted for use on the Space Shuttle. The seal incorporates a flange, drilled to match the mating parts, which provides a positive stop to control seal compression and secondary pressure barriers on each side of the seal to facilitate leak checking. While some seals were originally silver plated, present use is confined to Teflon® coated high nickel alloy steel seals. The seals are used on the ET and on the piping connecting the Tank to the Orbiter. Most have rated temperatures of -423 deg.F to +350 deg.F except for one which has a -423 deg.F to +800 deg.F rating. A typical seal installation as it is used on the ET is shown on Figure 2. Notice that the seal has both a dual-sided primary seal located at the interior periphery of the seal and a dual-sided secondary pressure barrier just inside the bolt circle. A Teflon® coated seal is used in the LH2 and GH2 systems while a silver plated seal is used in the LO2 and GO2 systems. 4. The Raco®/CreaveyTM Seal Configuration [D] Figure 3 shows the combination Raco®/CreaveyTM seal as used for 17-inch diameter feed lines on the ET. The primary Raco® seal consists of a metal hoop-spring inside an energized Teflon® jacket. The secondary CreaveyTM seal is a metallic coil spring housed within an energized tubular Teflon® casing. 5. Recommended Practices a. Design Practices In general design practice, the development of a good leak-free joint design requires an integral look at the design of all the parts: seal(s), flanges, and fasteners. It also requires some foreknowledge of the degree of access required for leak checking, inspection, and potential disassembly and reassembly during downstream operations and particularly on the launch pad. Leak-free joint design is based on the seal maintaining contact between a surface on one flange and the mating surface on the other flange under all operating conditions. The fasteners take the dynamic loads and are installed in a preloaded condition to maintain seal contact with the flange surfaces. The seal in the joint must prevent leakage in excess of the allowable limit. The advantages of deflection actuated, pressure assisted seals are that they maintain a nearly constant fastener loading under pressurized and nonpressurized conditions and that they result in minimum flange deflection at the sealing surface. Sealing surfaces on flanges can be recessed to protect them from damage, and seal grooves can be configured for easy seal installation, centering of the seal, and for error-free assembly. The seal and joint can be designed with detents to prevent misaligned or reverse installation. The design of joint assembly and seal installation tooling, equipment, fixtures, and procedures should proceed concurrent with joint design. The designer must remember that a separable joint is used to permit later disassembly, inspection, and reinsertion of seals or refurbishment/replacement of systems or components either in the manufacturing shop, on the test stand, or on the launch pad. The joint design and the assembly tooling or fixtures should provide: (1) protection to the seal and mating surface; (2) concentric and accurate seal positioning; and (3) even pressures around the periphery of the seal and joint during the fastener tightening process. Circumferential indexing that will ensure relocation of impressed seal surface deformities over corresponding flange deformities is desirable if the seal is to be reused. A good design practice is not to depend entirely on flange bolt locations to position seal components radially. A notch or groove should be provided to retain the seal. Gaskets, seals, parts, and subassemblies should be designed to preclude improper alignment or rotation. Using seals very close to the same size in the same area should be avoided. The design should be adaptable to using the same size seal (or a very different size) in all locations which are in close proximity. This practice will reduce the potential of installing the incorrect size seal. The following design suggestions pertain to seals for cryogenic and gaseous hydrogen and oxygen: Where feasible, secondary seals with a vent for direct measurement of leakage should be provided. The materials in cryogenic/gaseous hydrogen seals should be resistant to hydrogen embrittlement. Walls should be provided in the seal groove to carry the seal hoop load when pressurized. Designs of liquid oxygen seals should include LO2 compatible materials. Designs of liquid hydrogen seals should include LH2 compatible materials. Potential flange ovality resulting from flange stresses or temperature cycling must be taken into account in establishing the width of flange sealing surfaces. The seal material(s) must be compatible with any anticipated purge or cleaning material that may contact the seal during its intended use. Purge or cleaning material restrictions should be noted on engineering drawings and in procedural documentation. A seal alignment provision should be incorporated in the design process. Design optimization in metal seals for cryogenics can be accomplished with currently available general purpose finite element analysis programs such as ANSYS (produced by Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc., see reference #13) or by specially programmed finite element models (reference #14). Modeling of seals can take into account surface texture, gas transmission flow methods, seal load distribution, material properties, and dynamic environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, vibration, shock, etc.). New seal designs should be evaluated using these analysis and modeling techniques and qualified before use. (see below). b. Qualification Practices Prior to incorporation into the production design, the entire joint system, which includes the flanges, seal(s), and fasteners, should be qualified for use in the specific environments expected to be encountered in operations. [As part of the qualification procedures for SSME seals, seals of 0.8quot, 1.1quot, and 3.8quot diameter were chilled to -250 deg.F and pressure cycled from ambient pressure to 8,970 psig for 240 cycles while demonstrating their ability to continue to meet leakage requirements. Seals were also subjected to structural verification at pressures up to twice operating pressures after completion of 240 pressure cycles, while still meeting leakage requirements.] If different temperatures, pressures, or gases are used for qualification and/or leak checking, leak and nonleak conditions must be carefully calibrated and correlated with leak and nonleak conditions in the actual environments expected. These calibrations must be meticulously adhered to in interpreting leak test results. c. Manufacturing Practices Cleanliness and inspection at intermediate manufacturing steps are extremely important in the manufacture of deflection actuated pressure assisted seals as well as for other types of seals used in liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen environments. Nonspacer type seals are usually silver plated with an initial gold undercoat. The gold undercoat prevents oxidation of the substrate at temperatures above 600 deg.F, when used in hot gas environments, and this prevents blistering of the silver plating. Silver is used for its low compressive yield strength and ductility required for effecting a seal, and for its corrosion resistance. Rhodium overplate is used to prevent bonding of the silver plate to the mating flange surfaces at high temperatures. A chromate coating is used to prevent discoloration of the seal or flange due to tarnishing of the seal's silver plating. Care must be taken to thoroughly clean and inspect each seal between the plating and coating operations. Adherence of the Teflon® primer coat and subsequent final coat to spacer type seals also requires stringent cleaning and inspection between each operation to prevent inclusions, voids, contamination, and surface defects. d. Inspection Practices Seal and flange mating surfaces should be visually inspected after manufacture and immediately before installation with a 10X magnification device. Very tiny scratches across the face of the seal's coated or plated sealing surface can cause leaks. [In one instance, a scratch .001quot wide and .0005quot deep extending across the radial length of the sealing surface was of sufficient size to cause a Class I leak.] The inspector should look carefully not only for nicks and scratches in seals, but also for metal or foreign particles on the seal or on the mating flange surfaces. NASA problem reports have indicated that, in at least one incidence, metal flange faces were allowed to contact each other and to rub together prior to seal installation, causing fine metal particles to be created which interfered with the seal's ability to seat properly against the flange sealing surface. Optical microscopy up to a power of 50X has been used to detect very small flaws and irregularities in flange and seal surfaces when leakage tests failed. Seal flatness or waviness can be confirmed or detected by the glass test in which the seal is placed against a plate glass sheet and observed from the underside. This method can be used to detect potential nonparallelism or small deviations in seal contact or coating thickness. Precision flat bars can be used with a light source to verify that flange faces are flat. e. Protection Practices Many of the leaks detected from joints of cryogenic and gaseous lines were possibly caused by scratching or nicking of the flange sealing surfaces or the seal, after initial manufacturing and inspection, but before assembly. Post manufacturing, in-transit, and preassembly protection of both the seals and the joint sealing surfaces have proven to be essential in ensuring leak-free or acceptable leakage rate joints. LO2-compatible protection caps or plugs should be used to protect sealing surfaces between manufacturing inspection and final assembly. Liquid oxygen compatibility is required of materials protecting oxidizer system joints because small particles of the protection material can rub off against the seal or flange surface and could lead to a fire or explosion. Cleanliness is more easily maintained with proper protection while the joint is in a disassembled condition. f. Preparation Practices As with in-transit or in-storage protection, thorough cleaning of the seals and flanges, accompanied by preinstallation inspection, is required to ensure leak tight joints. If the flanges are to be in storage for an extended period, they require a protective grease or jelly. If so, this material must be removed and the flange cleaned and reinspected prior to assembly, as this substance may have picked up fine particles during storage. If a protective substance has not been used, thorough visual inspection must take place to ensure that there are no evidences of corrosion. If corrosion exists, it must be removed and the flanges or seals reinspected both dimensionally and visually. g. Installation and Assembly Practices Several of the unacceptable leaks of joints carrying cryogenic fluids reported in NASA's Problem Reporting and Corrective Action (PRACA) system resulted from scratches to the seal or flange faces during the assembly process after preassembly inspection. These scratches may have been caused by the flanges rubbing together or the seal rubbing against corners or edges of the flanges. Several methods have been proposed or implemented to reduce the potential of seal or joint sealing surface damage during assembly. One method is to place Teflon® shims on both sides of the seal while it is being inserted into place between the flanges, and then to remove the shims once the seal is in place. Procedures have been developed which would not allow the flanges to touch the seal until the bolt torque pulls the flanges together. Special seal retaining or insertion tools and other assembly equipment can be designed to minimize the potential of damage during assembly. Operators must be thoroughly trained and certified in these procedures. To provide uniform compression of the seal and a final uniform load around the seal's circumference, fasteners should be tightened in stages in a prescribed alternating fashion, starting with fasteners located 180 degrees apart. h. Leak Checking Methods The most common method of seal and joint inspection after assembly is the leak test. Several leak detection procedures are used to check the integrity of LH2, GH2, LO2 and GO2 joints and seals: (1) bubble method; (2) gas analysis method; (3) pressure decay method; and (4) flow meter method. The most prominent method of leak testing is the bubble method. In the bubble test, a leak test solution is applied to the periphery of the joint while the interior is being pressurized with liquid helium gas or nitrogen in a manner that has been calibrated against the operational fluid's temperature, pressure, and flow rate to provide acceptable or nonacceptable leak rates. The bubble test method is confined to gaseous systems or cold gas simulations of cryogenic joint pressures and temperatures. Four classes of leakage have been defined. In general, they are: Class I: Steady formation of very small, long persisting bubbles. Class II: Mixture of random size bubbles of moderate persistence. Class III: Large, fast-forming bubbles. Blowing: Bubble formation does not take place because of large gas flow. Another common method of leak detection is the gas analysis method using a mass spectrometer. Although this method will determine that a leak exists, it is difficult to measure or to calculate the leak rate from mass spectrometer test results. Advanced methods of leak detection using palladium sensors, colorimetric methods, and nonintrusive sensors are being studied, but none has yet been as successful in both detecting the leak and indicating its magnitude as the leak test solution method. The solution test method is simple, easy to use, and readily observable with the naked eye. Two precautions are important, however: (1) complete coverage of the joint with the leak test solution; and (2) close observation of the complete periphery of the joint. The technician should observe the leak test solution immediately after application so that a blowing leak is not missed. The general practice is to releak test whenever a joint is disturbed. In the case of the SSME, all joints are leak tested both before and after final hot firing acceptance. A total engine leak test is conducted at final acceptance to determine the total leakage from all 154 joints (80 oxidizer system joints, 44 fuel system joints, and 30 hot gas joints), which must be less than six standard cubic inches per minute. In general, ambient temperature leak checks are not as accurate as testing in the chilled condition. Therefore, at least in initial development and checkout, the system must be cooled to its operating temperature, and realistic pressures and flow rates must be provided to identify potential leak conditions. The alternative is to use a different cryogenic or gas with prior accurate calibration of leakage results with the operational fluids, as mentioned earlier. i. Storage Practices Joints, flanges, or seals in storage must be protected against corrosion and against inadvertent damage of the seal or sealing surfaces. The protection device or substance must be compatible with the fluid for which the joint was designed and with which it will be operated. In-storage protection devices or substances must be completely removed and the parts must be recleaned and inspected prior to assembly. j. Refurbishment and Reuse Practices Seals can be refurbished by replating and reinspecting them to the original manufacturing standards. Seals that are reused without refurbishment should be indexed to provide reassembly in the same position as originally installed. Seals with damaged coating can be stripped and recoated or replated as long as the parent metal seal is dimensionally correct. Technical Rationale: These practices were derived from a review of Unsatisfactory Condition Reports (UCRs) of the PRACA system at Marshall Space Flight Center; from sources listed in the references including professional journal articles, presentations, books on cryogenics, and Government reports; and from over 30 years of experience in designing propulsion systems and stages incorporating cryogenic sealing requirements.

Benefit: The primary benefit is increased mission reliability due to a reduction in design errors occurring during spacecraft development caused by inconsistent coordinate frame definitions. A document will be created early in the development of a spacecraft mission defining Attitude Control System (ACS) coordinate frames which will facilitate data transfer among subsystem engineers, speed documentation and communication during design and analysis reviews, expedite verification of instrument and sensor pointing, and assure that a record of the coordinate frames used will be available throughout mission planning, design, analysis, and flight. Implementation Method: Early in the development stages of a mission program, a document should be created, published, and distributed to all ACS and ACS related mission engineers. This document will list coordinate frame definitions needed for ACS design and analysis. It should also be periodically updated as mission objectives evolve and hardware changes are made. The following discusses ACS coordinate frame definitions and the format for listing them in the ACS Coordinate Frames Definition Document. 1. Overview of Coordinate Frame Definitions for ACS Design and Analysis: ACS coordinate frames contain an origin location and three unit vectors emanating from that origin. quotThe most convenient set of these vectors is a dextral (i.e., right-handed), orthonormal (i.e., mutually perpendicular and of unit length) triadquot [reference 4, p. 6]. Vector quantities can be expressed as projections onto each of the three triad unit vectors of a coordinate frame. Triads or frames can be related to each other through the use of rotation matrices [reference 4, pp. 8-10], thus permitting the expression of vectors in any desired frame. With the use of coordinate frames and vectors, the orientation and changes in orientation of spacecraft, celestial bodies, instruments, mechanisms, and other ACS related hardware and objects can be described. An overall base coordinate frame must be defined relative to which all other coordinate frames (discussed below) are defined. In many cases, this overall base frame will be an inertial frame which is used to determine overall mission success. For example, if the primary mission of the spacecraft is to point instruments at the sun, a good choice for the overall base frame might be the heliocentric reference frame [reference 7, p. 29] since the sun's motion can be easily established in this frame. Typically, within the ACS subsystem, several design issues must be addressed. These design issues can often be arranged into categories, such as overall spacecraft pointing; environmental disturbances; spacecraft mass properties; sensor, actuator, and instrument motion; and flexible body dynamics. A category reference frame should be established to address each design issue. For example, when modeling environmental disturbances in Earth orbit, an Earth centered inertial frame is usually used as the category reference frame. For defining the spacecraft mass properties, sensor, actuator, and instrument motion, and flexible body dynamics the category reference is some sort of spacecraft body fixed coordinate frame. If information is to be transferred between these ACS categories, transformations can be established through the overall base coordinate frame discussed above. Additional coordinate frames may be needed to define the motion or effect to be modeled within an ACS category. The effect to be analyzed may be defined in terms of an intermediate axis with this intermediate axis related back to the category reference frame. The coordinate frames needed for defining spacecraft motion within the orbital plane provide a good example of this process. A frame which is fixed to the spacecraft is defined first. This frame is used to define the motion of the spacecraft relative to the orbit plane. Then, a frame which is fixed to the orbital plane is used to define the motion of the orbit plane relative to an inertial frame. The result will determine the spacecraft motion relative to the inertial frame. Another example of the use of intermediate axes for addressing ACS design issues is the relationship among sensor and instrument reference frames. One axis of these frames is almost always defined along the boresight of the sensor or instrument. The other two axes should match some other characteristics (e.g., parallel to the edges of a square field of view). The origin is at any convenient point. The relationships of the nominal and quottrackingquot (a frame that moves with the boresight to track the sensor motion) boresight frames to the category reference can be achieved in many different ways depending on accuracy and knowledge requirements. Several intermediate frames might be needed to achieve these relationships. Often, both the nominal and tracking boresight frames must be related to a payload interface frame, and all requirements of alignment are specified between this interface frame and another frame, the spacecraft optical frame. Typically, the interface frame axes are nominally parallel to the spacecraft optical axes, and the optical axes are defined with respect to an optical master reference cube. The nominal position of this cube relative to the spacecraft mechanical build axes (used for defining hardware locations within the spacecraft) must be defined next. Finally, this mechanical build frame may be used as the category reference or is then related to the category reference. The figure below shows the nominal orientations of these frames used in the SOHO spacecraft [reference 1, p. 2.8]. This example demonstrates the process of how coordinate frames are used to define the sensor and instrument pointing relative to its category reference frame. [D] A discussion of the frames needed to model how actuators are used for attitude control is presented as a final example of the use of intermediate frames. Momentum wheels, control moment gyros (CMG's), torque rods, and thrusters are commonly used control actuators. Frames are needed to represent the nominal orientation and location, misalignments produced when installing, and movement of the actuators. Also, rotation matrices which relate these frames to the category reference, usually the spacecraft ACS axes, must be determined. As a specific example, consider the frames needed in distributing control torques among a reaction wheel set containing 4 wheels. The wheels are usually aligned in a pyramid configuration as shown below. A frame is first defined for each wheel with one axis along the spin axis of each wheel. Then, rotation matrices are created relating each wheel frame to the spacecraft ACS frame (called roll, pitch, and yaw for this case). This example demonstrates how intermediate and category frames are used to relate the orientation and motion of actuators (in this case, reaction wheels) to achieve desired torques. [D] 2. Document Format A suggested format or outline for the coordinate frame definitions document is summarized below. However, this format is only a guide, and the user may need to change or add to the format depending on the spacecraft mission. Since the choices of ACS coordinate frames to be defined are dependent on the overall spacecraft pointing objectives and the proposed ACS mission hardware required, these topics should be discussed first. To avoid any ambiguity, coordinate system symbols and nomenclature to be used should be listed next. Specific coordinate frame definitions should follow -- an overall base frame, category reference frames, and frames needed within each category. Finally, a way of relating all the coordinate frame definitions should be included.

Category Frames Group design issues into appropriate categories, e.g., spacecraft, instrument, and sensor pointing, actuator sizing, environmental disturbances, spacecraft mass properties, etc. Within each category, a category reference frame should be listed along with all other frames needed to address design and analysis issues. Figures showing the physical relationships among these frames would be helpful. Coordinate Frame Transformations Relate each frame to the overall base frame. The first section of the document (after the table of contents) states the overall mission objectives and the criteria for a successful operation. The objectives include a list of celestial, Earth based, or other bodies to which the spacecraft and instruments must point. A discussion of the pointing accuracy and knowledge error definitions and specifications for performance needs to be given. Orbit parameters, spacecraft mass properties, and any issues that might affect the mission objectives or success criteria are provided in this section. This section will aid the reader in understanding the rationale behind the choice of coordinate frames. The second section of the document contains an overview of ACS hardware. Included in this discussion are locations, orientations, and functions of all ACS related hardware. The locations and orientations are best shown with a figure or a reference to an interface drawing. If the hardware moves or reorients itself (such as solar array rotation to track the sun) relative to the spacecraft, this change is to be documented. The anticipated effects of flexibility should also be considered. Instrument and attitude sensor functions are given in relation to the overall ACS concept. For example, a magnetometer is used to determine the magnetic field of the Earth relative to the spacecraft. The location and orientation of the magnetometer relative to the spacecraft needs to be given, along with a statement of how the magnetometer may be used in conjunction with other ACS hardware and software. The magnetometer output may be used for attitude sensing or for determining when to pulse a torque rod to provide an attitude control moment. These different functions for the magnetometer may result in different coordinate frame choices. The third section of the document needs to discuss the nomenclature and symbols to be used for the coordinate frame definitions. The format may vary depending on the spacecraft mission. An example definition taken from reference 6 [p. 4], and shown below, demonstrates a possible format which may be used for defining reference frames. A descriptive or commonly used name is given first. A one or two letter symbol is listed next, which is also used for labeling the vectors comprising the axes of the frame. Then, a description of the frame is provided, and this description is to contain enough detail to unambiguously locate the frame. Equatorial Inertial Coordinate System, E (E1, E2, E3) This is the basic inertial coordinate system. All other coordinate systems are defined with respect to E. The origin is at the center of the Earth. The E3 axis is in the equatorial plane and it is positive toward the vernal equinox. The E2 axis is perpendicular to the equatorial plane, and it is positive toward the Earth's North Pole. (The E1 axis completes the orthogonal triad.) The vernal equinox position is defined as its mean position at 1950.0. All the frames included in the document are related to the overall base frame. Rotation matrices are commonly used to convert components of vectors from one frame to another, and the development of the mathematics is available in the literature [reference 4, pp. 6-31], [reference 6, pp. 10-20], and [reference 7, pp. 410-420, 758-759]. To avoid any ambiguity in the definitions of coordinate frame rotations and their matrices, a discussion of this topic is to be included at the beginning of this section of the document. This discussion should include definitions of Euler angles, quaternions, direction cosine matrices, or other mathematics to be used to relate the frames. Then, a table or any convenient format is included at the end of the document which contains information relating each frame back to the overall base frame. Finally, figures illustrating the nominal relationships among all these frames and the possible reorientations of the frames during flight is essential and is included in the document. Technical Rationale: Due to the increased complexity of ACS work for spacecraft, a document is needed in the early stages of the project development which contains consistent and well-defined coordinate system definitions. Definitions are needed to accurately communicate within and between various design and analysis disciplines affecting ACS performance. These disciplines include spacecraft pointing, environmental disturbances, spacecraft mass properties, sensors, actuators, and instrument motion, structural dynamics, and mechanisms. Analytical and design mistakes can occur due to communicating erroneous information within and between design and analysis groups. This erroneous communication can be caused by inconsistent or ambiguous coordinate frame definitions. If a document listing coordinate frames to be used for ACS design and analysis is published and adhered to, then many problems can be avoided. For example, an ACS engineer may need to know the mass and inertia of the spacecraft in order to simulate the dynamics. However, when obtaining this information from structural or design engineers, often the ACS and the structural body frames are not consistent. If a mission standard was established early in the program life, both body frames would be consistent, or at least, the creation of a rotation matrix between frames would be readily obtained. Documentation of ACS frames would also be clear, consistent, and complete if this guideline is followed. During preliminary and critical design reviews, much time is spent searching for definitions of ACS frames and information relating those frames. If all the frames are compiled into one document and are related to an overall base frame, considerable time and effort will be saved. Verification of spacecraft, instrument hardware, and other mechanism pointing will be facilitated. Often it is necessary to visually or otherwise make quotsanityquot checks to make sure that component rotations will result in the desired orientation. For example, for Earth orbiting spacecraft it is necessary as part of the mission systems verification to make sure that spacecraft solar arrays quottrackquot the sun. To make this verification, the sun and the solar array normal vectors must be written in the same frame and compared. This process involves several coordinate frame rotations which should be defined in the document generated through this guideline. An accurate record of these coordinate frames will be available throughout mission planning, development, and flight. If during development of hardware and software for flight a technical glitch occurs, it will be necessary to review the ACS design analysis work performed. Without documented ACS coordinate definitions, analyses may be difficult to validate causing additional costs and delays in the mission. Also, ACS engineers will be able to review coordinate frame definitions created with this guideline enabling them to better plan and analyze for future spacecraft missions.

Benefit: The design data provides a list of materials and conditions which are compatible for use with fluorine. The use of this data by design engineers will result in the selection of materials for use with fluorine that can provide safe and reliable system operation. Implementation Method: Generally failures in systems using fluorine are caused by: (1) improper choice of materials and/or system components; (2) improper fabrication and assembly practices, (ref 1); and (3) improper system preparation and operating procedures, resulting in the presence of contaminants. This guideline applies design considerations to preclude failures caused by improper choice of materials. Design guidelines to address failure causes (2) and (3) are beyond the scope of this document (see Reference 1). The design considerations to be used in selection of materials for use in fluorine systems should consist of: Selection of materials based on property requirements for the application (e.g., strength, thermal properties, welding or brazing characteristics, etc). [Note: This design consideration represents standard design approach and is presented here for completeness only] Selection of materials that can be fabricated without introducing contaminants and/or entrapped voids. Consideration of effects peculiar to a fluorine environment (e.g., ignition temperature of material in fluorine, fluoride films and exposure to friction, moisture presence and compatibility with hydrogen fluoride, etc). The design considerations of (b) and (c) above are based on extensive test experience from liquid fluorine rocket testing conducted at LeRC, and from materials tests conducted at LeRC and other laboratories. References 1, 2, and 3 present material compatibility with liquid fluorine for metallic and nonmetallic materials, respectively. Table 1 below, extracted from reference 1 and presented here for purposes of illustration, lists the ignition temperatures and ignition delays for metals in fluorine. Table 1.

In technique A, an evacuated bomb was filled with gaseous fluorine at atmospheric pressure and the fluorine was increased in temperature by a heated wire. The temperature at which the wire burned is listed in the part of Table 1 for technique A. In technique B, the evacuated bomb was brought to temperature before fluorine introduction. The time required for the reaction to go to completion, the ignition delay, is listed in the part of Table 1 for technique B. In addition, Table 2 was produced from Reference 1 which shows an expanded list of materials and their reactive effects with fluorine. Reference 1 also includes the effects of the presence of water and corrosion, the effects of fluoride films and their characteristics, and specific reaction of fluorine spills. Table 2. Compatibility of Materials in Fluorine Aluminum and aluminum alloys An aluminum trifluorine (AlF3) film is formed on the surface of the surface of the metal or alloy. The melting point of aluminum is below its ignition point with fluorine gas. Iron, iron alloys, steels Ferrous and ferric films are formed at a higher rate and depth than other mild resistant metals. Reaction from moisture and hydrogen fluoride is also greater. Stainless steels Resistant to attack by hydrogen fluoride is greater than most mild steels. A fluoride film is formed with characteristics equivalent to Monel. The film becomes less stable at elevated temperature. Stainless steel welds behave similarly as the parent material. Nickel (A, D, and L), Nickel bearing alloys, & Monel Fluoride films are similar to that on aluminum, but are stable for use at high temperature (1200°F). Welding does not reduce the corrosion resistance of nickel or Monel if fluxes either are not used or are completely removed. Inconel, Illium, Illium ""R"", and Duranickel are less resistant than either nickel or Monel at higher temperatures but are generally similar to stainless steels. Copper Highly resistant to fluorine attack as are the copper alloys, red brass, and yellow brass. Cupric fluoride film is very stable in the presence of dry fluorine or dry hydrogen fluoride, but hydrolyzes readily in moisture to form hydrofluoric acid. Titanium Poor resistance to hydrogen fluoride. Liquid fluorine has the tendency to be highly reactive with titanium. Gaseous fluorine will attack titanium at temperatures above 300°F. Silver solder: Nicrobraze Recommended for most of the joining where welding is impractical or impossible. Connections made with this material have been highly reliable. Chromium Four fluorides are formed: 1) divalent, 2) trivalent, 3) tetravalent, and 4) pentavalent (3 an 4 are volatile). When chromium is reacted with fluorine below 300°F it forms a protective divalent fluoride film. Above 300°F, the fluoride is converted from a divalent to a volatile tetravalent fluoride form and loses its protective ability. Beryllium Behaves much the same way as nickel in fluoride film formation. Tantalum should not be used at temperatures above 150°F Lead Forms a nontenacious fluoride film. In passive exposure it has been used successfully as a seal or gasket material. Tin Reacts similarly to lead and can also be used for soft gaskets in cryogenic service. Rhodium, palladium, platinum Can be used on contact with fluorine at room temperature generally without attack. These metals are used in some equipment because they are inert to hydrogen fluoride. The list in the above table shows a variety of metals which are compatible to a certain degree in fluorine. Generally nonmetallic materials are incompatible with fluorine, with the exception of ruby and Teflon (see References 1 & 3). It should be understood by the designer that material selection is dependent on the environmental conditions. To assist the designer in developing a safe fluorine system, Table 3 lists recommended materials to be used under certain operating conditions. Table 3. Recommended Materials for High and Low Pressure Operations HIGH AND ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE OPERATIONS Materials Preferred High Pressure: (>14.7-1500 psi.) Nickel or Monel More resistant to ignition than steel. These metals are preferred when handling pure fluorine under pressure. Monel piping can even be used at higher pressures than Nickel. Atmospheric Pressure: Copper, Iron, Stainless Steel, and Brass If the piping wall thickness is adequate, i.e., as in standard or extra-strong pipe, the material weight and surface area are large enough to eliminate spontaneous combustion. High & Low Pressure Connections: Welding, Flange joints Through experiments, welding has proved to be highly reliable in high and low pressure. Soft solder and fluxes should not be used, however. Flange joints are preferred when necessary, gaskets must be limited to soft metals, lead, tin, copper or aluminum. Valves Bellows-sealed valves generally can be used up to 100 psi., in 1-inch and larger sizes. The Hoke Monel needle valves or the Kerotest 440-A packed with Teflon or its equivalent have been successful. Metal-seated valves with Monel or aluminum-bronze seat-and-disk combinations have also been used successfully for low pressure valves. Technical Rationale: Certain effects peculiar to a fluorine environment need to be considered by the designer. Fluorine is a highly reactive oxidizing agent; it has the highest oxidation potential of all elements. Fluorine can react with practically all organic and inorganic substances with few exceptions. Exceptions include the inert gases, fluorinated compounds in their highest state of oxidization, and a few fluorinated polymers. Whether a substance will burn spontaneously in fluorine, or whether fluorine will replace an oxidant having a lower oxidizing potential, depends on the following conditions of exposure, (Reference 1): Initial temperature of the region. Reaction is initiated by reaching the ignition temperature or by providing activation energy from impact, friction, high flow, or reaction of contaminants. Initial pressure of the region. It has been found that ignition temperatures are lowered by increasing pressure. Thermal conductivity if the material is a solid. Combustion will not occur if heat of reaction can be removed by conduction and the temperature can be maintained below ignition temperature of material. Exposed surface area with respect to mass of the substance. Generally, surface reactions with most metals will form a fluoride film and inhibit further reaction. Large exposed surface-area-to-mass material forms (fine mesh screen, powered metal, etc.) can have surface reactions that are highly reactive and can increase temperatures to initiate combustion. Kinetic or static exposure. It has been found that kinetic energy from flow dynamics can contribute to activation energy for combustion. Fluorine concentration in the region. Reactivity increases with increased fluorine content of liquid or gaseous mixtures. Fluorine can react combustively with water depending on the size of water droplets. Ice will react combustively with liquid fluorine. In the presence of water, the fluorine will react to form hydrogen fluoride potentially resulting in corrosion. Therefore, the entry of water into the system in any form, even from non-dry purge gases or moisture laden air, is to be avoided. In addition to the selection of materials based on property requirements for the application (i.e. strength, thermal properties, welding or brazing characteristics, etc), the selection of materials for use with fluorine must consider the introduction of contaminants into the system and whether a given material will burn spontaneously in the presence of fluorine. Materials selected must be cleaned free of contaminants and fabricated without introducing contaminants and/or entrapped voids. The contaminant can be in the form of a material additive or foreign material (ice, moisture, grease, soil, etc.) which unintentionally enters the system. The contaminant can then react with fluorine and cause local temperatures to exceed the ignition temperature for that part of the system, resulting in failure. The presence of voids can lead to trapped contaminants that escape cleaning procedures and therefore must be avoided. References: Schmidt, H.

Benefits: Process controls on design, manufacturing, and testing operations reduce component failure rates and improve reliability. The goal is production of power supplies that will operate in space for the mission duration. Implementation Method: There are special requirements in packaging HV power supplies for space use. The power processor should be voltage-partitioned and the low voltage circuits should be separated from the high voltage circuits. This is usually done with a metal wall. There still will be signals transmitted between the sections. All grounds should be isolated to provide a means to predict the currents when transients or arcs occur. When capacitors discharge, there can be current flows of several hundred amperes. The low voltage section should be protected from these current and voltage surges. Table 1 shows recommended design practices used for an 11 kV CTS TWT power supply. All volumes must be vented. The pressure in any unvented volume will decrease gradually and result in corona or arcing. Allow for screens, RF traps, etc.; and count only the holes in the screens. Interior volumes, down to the capped nut plates, must also be vented. Table 1. High Voltage Power Supply Design Guidelines PHYSICAL LAYOUT Voltage Partitioning (Separate high and low voltage components) Isolated Grounds (Provide known current path for transients) Voltage Suppression (Suppress signal from high voltage to low voltage circuits) ELECTRIC FIELDS Solid Dielectric: DC Stress 50 Volts/MIL AC Stress 10 Volts/MIL Surface Creepage 8 Volts/MIL Air or Vacuum Gap 20 Volts/MIL VENTING >2 cm2 per 1000cc of enclosed volume (screens and RF traps reduce vent size), including: Capped nut plates Dielectric spacers Polyolefin shrinkable tubing High voltage connectors Figure 1 shows the fabrication methods used to build this supply. Round off all edges on metal as well as dielectric materials. Use anti-corona spheres. Void-free encapsulation is important. Remove excess RTV from bolts to keep vent paths open. Use shrink tubing in strips for hold downs, to avoid trapped air. Dielectric separators must be sized correctly for surface creepage. Anti-corona spheres should have a vent hole to eliminate voids in the solder. Dielectric inserts should be slotted to vent the interior volume. [D] Figure 2 illustrates the special construction methods used in the HV compartment for the equipment to operate in the thermal and vacuum environment of space. Table 2 shows the testing methods that should be used to check out the HV power supply. The glass epoxy boards should be scanned ultrasonically to check for density differences. The transformers and components mounted on the boards should be corona-tested. Corona discharges of less than 5 picocoulombs are allowed. Induced voltage in the dielectric testing should be done in vacuum at temperature per MIL-T-27. The corona tests should be repeated to detect internal degradation from the high voltage stress. Be careful to bake out the components at 65 degrees C for 72 hours in the vacuum chamber and cool the components down before the power supply is turned on. [D] Table 2. Testing Corona testing: Transformers Component Configuration on Boards <5 Picocoulombs Electric Testing: Induced voltage (twice-rated voltage) Dielectric withstanding (2.5 times rated AC and DC) Important to perform in vacuum at temperature Thermal Testing: Minimum of 10 temperature cycles at component level Minimum of 3 temperature cycles at box level Initial thermal-vacuum test preceded by bakeout of 65°C for 72 hours Ultrasonic Scanning of Glass Epoxy Boards (NASA TM X-73432) Technical Rationale: These design criteria were developed experimentally. The various component configurations, board layouts, and component assemblies were tested to 125% of expected working voltage in air, vacuum, and full operating temperature with a requirement that the corona inception measured less than 5 picocoulombs. An example of an early flight failure caused by corona was a short that developed between two pins of a high voltage connector. Gas trapped inside connector voids gradually decreased in pressure until corona discharge began to decompose the insulating material. When the insulating material thickness was reduced to the point that leakage started increasing, a carbon tree formed and a short occurred, disabling the experiment. This can be easily avoided by running corona tests on all high voltage parts to ensure that no gases are trapped in high voltage circuits.

Benefit: Increases confidence in designs and their operational reliability. Ensures accuracy of design analyses, completeness of requirements in procurement documents and thoroughness of test planning. Ensures functional compatibility of assembly and test fixtures. Implementation Method: Designs must factor in effects of the space environment. Relevant differences between ground test conditions and flight deployment should be identified for consideration at the design and test stages to assure operation with adequate margins. G-negation pickup points can be designed in. Historically, some deployables have passed ground tests but failed in space. Space imposed conditions include thermal gradients and thermally induced loads, outgassing, low moisture, zero gravity and ballooned thermal blankets. Handbook material values do not always apply for the space environment. Physical parameters vary such as solid film lubricant friction which varies with moisture content. The space environment is not easy to simulate in earthbound tests and allowance should be made for expected parameter variations. Deployed appendages should be designed using the following guidelines: Avoid complication; simple designs are more reliable. Avoid single point failures. If unavoidable, assure generous margins. Where practical, design them out or employ redundancy unless redundant complication reduces reliability. Assure redundancy is truly independent, not coupled. Margins - Provide minimum torque/force margin: Tt = 1.25 Tf + 4.0* Tv where: Tt = minimum total available torque/force Tf = fixed and non-variable loads such as Ia terms Tv = worst case variable torques/forces such as coulomb friction and other loads which vary with environmental conditions and operating life. *Factor 4.0 is the Design Goal, reduced where excessive mass, power or volume is required, e.g., motor driven mechanisms. Maintain a minimum factor of 2.0 under worst case degraded conditions. Force analyses should use best available loads and forces and examine the full range of expected minimum and maximum parameter values, make adequate allowance for uncertainty. Torque requirements are higher with high friction, deployment velocity and momentum higher with low friction. Use test verified values where available for such critical parameters as friction (if only handbook values available, multiply by 3 to cover uncertainties), cable flexure torque, bearing drag torque. Include worst case thermal effects, wearout, friction changes and end-of-life conditions. Designs should tolerate moderate increases in friction. Maintain calculated torque/force margins above 2 with m assumed up to 0.5 for typical material combinations. Friction force estimates are untrustworthy, handbook values represent controlled conditions. Use cautiously, test if possible. Consider case differences between published numbers and actual conditions such as effects of part surface treatments, differences between ground test conditions and space environment (humidity, pressure, loads). Use appropriate fits, alignment tolerances, surface treatments, deburring and hardness differentials to avoid galling which nullifies friction estimates. Temperature effects at deployment should be accounted for, e.g., torque/force changes at hingelines and separation points from temperature gradients within assemblies, bulk temperature effects and differential temperatures between deployables and mounting structure. Humidity effects, e.g., molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) friction varies and nonmetals change size with moisture content, can affect torque margins and fit clearances. Moly lube should not contain graphite. Rolling element bearing loads for long life devices should be kept below 320,000 psi mean Hertzian stress for launch, 200,000 psi or lower for operation, less if lubrication is marginal. Consider effects on bearing preload, torque and life due to thermal gradients and bulk temperature variations. Analysis. Loads analyses and load sharing between deployed appendages and spacecraft structure can be greatly affected by compliance of typical appendage joints. Examples are bolt preloaded joints, separation joint clamping devices, bearing supported hinge lines, and movable mechanical joints such as gimbals and solar array drives. Accurate stiffness knowledge of these devices is crucial for valid loads analyses. Verification and validation should be addressed in design, and plans made to acquire sufficient data to verify models. Kinematic diagrams should be constructed including all degrees of freedom and constraints. For accurate loads and stress analyses, assure correct component parameters are used in the Finite Element Analysis (e.g., bearing stiffness, friction coupling, compliance of bonded joints, stiffness of movable joints - clearance fit or preloaded, transmissibility across joints). Perform loads analysis based on true compliance of individual members for accurate assessment of load sharing. Cross-check with deflection analyses, compare with measured values. Incorporate proper deployment angles, velocity, acceleration and impacts to size components with adequate predicted margins. Include critical component parameters in analysis based on actual measured unit data where possible, eg. bearing friction, compliance of assemblies. Account for fabrication and assembly variables which affect design parameters used in analysis. Evaluate zero-g case to determine impact on design and verification. Jerking (non-uniform acceleration) can be critical in deployment. Its effects should be evaluated. Stick-slip friction conditions can worsen the condition. Stowed and deployed frequencies should be evaluated. These affect launch loads and Flight Attitude Control. Separation Planes Employ kickoff springs where practical in the separation joints; especially important for long appendages. Use anti-seize, anti-weld coatings, dissimilar materials. Provide retention joint flexure capability to accommodate launch loads, e.g., spherical, vs conical cup-cones. Assure adequate dynamic envelope clearance. Use the following guidelines for wire and cable routing at hingelines. Mechanical design of appendages should allow cabling across the hinges to be left fixed and undisturbed after component deployment testing throughout spacecraft assembly and integration. Provide field joints for connection of hinge and cable subassemblies. Minimize flexure torque through entire travel, allow for temperature effects. Test new designs. Use wire guides and clamps, braided and laced cables to maintain free loop control in 1g testing and launch environment and to avoid snags during deployment. Control chaffing during deploy and stow tests and launch vibration. Use proper cable clamp size for no-slip position control and cushioned clamps for Coax cables. Control Coax cable minimum bend radius. Coax Cable Protection during Component Assembly and Integration and Test Design-in armor protection where possible. Provide takeup allowance for connect/disconnect without cable kinking. Train personnel in correct handling procedures. Follow planned Coax cable handling procedures, use safe temporary support when free ends are not connected, provide for safe and gentle tie-down, prevent crush. Sharp Edges Eliminate sharp corners that cut through lube coatings, produce galling. Use specific drawing callout to control break and blend of sharp corners on moving elements. This is not always covered by general drawing callouts or implemented under General Workmanship Standards. Double-check workmanship during assembly; visually inspect for sharp corners, handcheck running fits and clearances and verify clearance of chamfers to inside corners. Contamination Control Design-in labyrinth or contact type seals to contain lubricants, minimize outgassing and limit external contamination. Limit Switches for Position Monitoring Switches are prone to misadjustment and failure. Use only to indicate safe/stow/deploy positions, not to control deployment sequence. Allow for overtravel and deadband (hysteresis) effects, provide adequate margins for actuation force and stroke. Provide simple, stable adjustability at assembly. Avoid galling of close-fit parts in moving members during assembly or operation. Prefer non-galling metal-metal couples. Provide adequate differential hardness of parts. Substitute anti-galling stainless steel for conventional SST. Provide anti-gall surface treatments to prevent damage in assembly/disassembly/adjustment operations. Provide anti-gall treatment for titanium parts and fasteners. Provide adequate clearance fit allowances in moving members to accommodate: Bulk temperature effects, thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch effects and temperature gradient effects. Design slip fit interfaces for thermal expansion takeup. Assure friction control where intentional slip is required. Use surface treatments, lubricants and fit clearances which prevent lockup or cocking where slip is intended. Deployment and Temperature Effects. Determine temperature effects on stowed and deployed frequencies. If explosive deployment devices are used, determine near source shock levels and effects on deployables (instruments, optical devices, etc.). Deploy latches must not rely on appendage momentum; latches should lockup under static (zero velocity) appendage force/torque. If friction dependent, control surface contamination for predictable friction. Avoid thermally induced misalignment (e.g., differential temperature of deployable boom legs). Consider post-deployment thermal contraction of deployable boom lanyards causing limit switch reactuation at low temperature. Control deployment end-of-travel impact, use energy absorbing dampers where necessary. Use floating pin/flange arrangement for hinge joints where practical to provide redundant sliding surfaces. If system will be dormant for a long time, it should be designed so all deployable parts can be partially deployed and retracted periodically to prevent ""lockup"" due to stiction, lubricant changes, or adhesion of plastics. Handling - large items Design-in handling fixture attachment points. Locate attachment points to position c.g. for stable lifting. Where feasible, provide for 1g counterbalance attachment on hardware for functional testing. Design-in self-fixturing alignment and assembly guides. Self-aligning guides permit assembly without expensive fixtures, reduce need for highly skilled personnel. Provide self-aligning parts, with lead-in where practicable to protect precision surfaces, interfaces and bearings and minimize assembly debris generation. Provide disassembly features. Plan for unexpected disassembly, rework or reinspection. Design-in pry slots on close fit parts to permit easy separation without damage during typical assembly and disassembly for fit checking, shim selection or end shake checks. Provide puller holes, slots, jacking screw threaded holes or punch holes for disassembly of press fit components. Key electrical connections. Use differently keyed or dissimilar electrical connections for squibs and motors to prevent inadvertent interchange between prime and redundant and prevent malfunction. Use specific fastener hardware designs for appendages. Use plated self-locking nuts that reduce thread wear and reduce probability of galling and thread seizure but withstand few reuses. Fastener seizure and removal degrades critical hardware. Limit reuse of self-locking designs. Threads can become damaged, generate wear particles. Choose head designs for driver engagement appropriate to application, torque requirement and accessibility for tools. Small hex drive screws strip easily, Torque-Set and coinslot drive types are difficult to remove. Torque stripe where appropriate to ensure integrity, permit later verification. Avoid countersunk (flat head) fastener usage where practical; driver engagement is easily damaged. Provide clearance for thermal blankets and tiedowns at moving interfaces. Provide a taping edge or draw string flange to control blanket edges at moving interfaces. Provide adequate clearance for launch environment dynamic deflections with no protrusions or sharp edges to catch blankets. Provide adequate clearance gap with securely taped edges at moving interfaces; minimum one inch between hard surfaces which get blanketed. Lubrication for deployed appendages. Lubrication is crucial for deployables, many of which are mission critical. Key lubricant functions include the separation of surfaces and friction reduction. This is critical because often the deployment forces and kickoff spring forces are kept small to minimize dynamic forces. For sensitive science missions, extremely low outgassing is essential. Most deployables are single use and experience few cycles through test and flight so long wear life issues are not paramount in the lube selection. However, movable joints must sustain ground and launch environments, Flight conditions of sometimes long duration, and then deployment, often at temperature extremes. The clamped separation joints may experience micromotion at interfaces during ground handling, test and launch environments which can disturb surfaces. Lubes must stay in place to effectively separate surfaces, not outgas excessively and minimize friction. Surfaces that must separate or move relative to one another (e.g. hinge line bearings and latching devices) must be designed to preclude the possibility of metal-to-metal adhesion which causes increased friction and, in extreme cases, galling. Launch shifts or on-orbit thermal gradients can produce unexpected added forces at the separation points. To minimize friction problems the following guidelines are followed: Maximize utilization of rolling surfaces, as opposed to sliding motion. Lubrication or separation of all moving surfaces either by a suitable aerospace grease or dry lubricant coating should be used without exception, even for lightly loaded ""friction compatible"" surfaces. On hard mating surfaces where hard coatings are used (such as Type III anodizing on aluminum) loads must be kept below the bearing yield strength of the substrate metal (e.g. 60 ksi for 6061-T6 aluminum). Smooth and polished mating surfaces are preferred. Dissimilar material mating surfaces should have low mutual solid solubility, or at least one of the two should have a heavy dissimilar coating (e.g. nitride, carbide or oxide). Caging devices should be designed to positively preclude relative motion between clamped surfaces when subjected to shipment or launch vibration. Any separation (gapping) under launch loads is undesirable. Small amplitude oscillatory motion between mating surfaces can damage lubricating films and, in the extreme, result in fretting (adhesion) of the surfaces. Two alternatives are available for lubrication - ""wet"" lube with a low vapor pressure aerospace grease and ""dry"" lube by means of bonded or sputtered MoS2 coatings. The wet lube is generally preferred because the lubricating film is self healing and frictional behavior is more consistent and predictable. The grease with the most heritage is Bray 600 series, a synthetic fluorinated oil thickened with micron sized TeflonTM powder. The grease is extremely low outgassing (TML<0.1% and CVCM <0.05% for the standard 125°C - 24 hour test) making contamination concerns negligible for virtually all S/C applications. The wet lube usable temperature range is -80°C to +200°C. For extreme low temperatures, cryogenic applications and other special circumstances, MoS2 coatings are suitable. For most consistent performance and lowest possible outgassing these films should be applied by the ion sputtering process. Epoxy and polyimide bonded films can be successfully employed with proper application and burnishing to remove excess material. Technical Rationale: Careful and critical review during the design stage can produce better, more reliable designs. Such foresight can help avoid many fabrication, assembly, test and deployment problems. These guidelines highlight often overlooked but recurring troublesome problems. Incorporation of successful practices from past experience can reduce cost, avoid unexpected schedule impacts and improve reliability of new devices.

Often the success of the design is critically dependent on a material or materials performing as desired. This is especially true in the case of advanced composite materials with polymer matrices reinforced with carbon or aramid (Kevlar®) fibers. The important considerations necessary for a proper selection of a fiber-reinforced polymer composite material in NASA spacecraft and satellite structures include fiber material, fiber reinforcement form, fiber volume, matrix material, ply lamination, processing, cost, database, health and safety factors and end-item properties.",GSFC,2/1/1999,"This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Guideline Number GD-ED-2210 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Benefit: Proper selection of the fiber, fiber-reinforcement form, and polymer matrix will produce a material system that 1) satisfies design property requirements thermal/physical/mechanical), 2) facilitates fabrication processes (lay-up and cure) and 3) minimizes program risks (cost, schedule, and technical). Implementation Method: Overview Unlike a monolithic, homogenous material or an alloy, a composite is composed of two or more materials that retain their identity on the macroscopic level. Materials composing a composite can be classified as a reinforcement or strengthening phase and a matrix or binder phase. Reinforcement materials can be ceramics, polymers, or wires. Reinforcement forms can be continuous fibers, discontinuous or chopped fibers, whiskers, particles, platelets, etc. Matrix materials can be polymers, metals, or ceramics. The primary consideration of this guideline is fiber reinforcements and thermoset polymer matrices in the most common product form, a prepreg (pre-impregnated and partially cured) sheet or ply. This is done out of practical considerations, since these composites possess the highest structural efficiency (specific properties) and are the most highly developed in terms of processing methods and material characterization (data base). Much of the information in the guideline is, however, relevant to other manufacturing forms and methods, such as Resin Transfer Molding, Filament Winding, Fiber Placement, Pultrusions, and Injection Molding. The content by volume of fibers in the composite is a critical parameter from which the composite derives thermo/physical/mechanical properties. A body of science called micromechanics [references 1-4] exists to predict the properties of composites as a function of fiber volume given the material properties of the reinforcement and matrix. Micromechanics will not be discussed in this article. Fiber reinforcement in a ply can be unidirectional or multidirectional. The latter applies to woven and non-woven fabrics. Choice of reinforcement form is a degree of freedom that can result in better processing and labor savings in part fabrication. Plies with either or both reinforcement scheme are stacked and cured to make a laminate. The ply fiber angles in the laminate are oriented to satisfy application design requirements (stiffness, strength, thermal expansion, etc.). Laminate design/analysis methods will not be covered in this article. Information on this subject can be found in many publications [references 5-8]. The matrix phase is typically the material that most affects the processing, and most directly the curing of the composite. Choices for polymer matrices include a variety of epoxies, polyimides, and others. The choice of polymer matrix determines to a great degree the operational temperature limits for the composite. The matrix phase also affects other physical properties, such as outgassing and moisture diffusion. Lastly, there are additional considerations that include economic, experience (flight history), and safety considerations that factor into the selection of a composite material. Table 1 summarizes relevant selection considerations for a fiber-reinforced composite with a polymer matrix. A more detailed discussion of the selection considerations follows. Table 1. Composite Selection Considerations Fiber Considerations Thermo/physical/mechanical properties and relevance to end application Ply thickness and tow size availability Ply flexibility and part curvature Sizing and surface treatments for matrix bonding and wetting Cost, availability, lead time, and stable supply source Reinforcement Considerations Part curvature Ply thickness Laminate ply orientations Machining Weaving styles (drape) and weaving vendors Cost, availability, lead time, and stable supply source Resin Considerations Fiber sizing compatibility and wetting Cure temperature and related items: laminate residual stresses, tooling expansion, upper use temperature, composite glass transition temperature (Tg), and microcracking Prepeg handling characteristics: tack, drape, outlife Flow characteristics and processing method Mechanical properties: shear and tensile strength, modulus and strain compatibility with the reinforcing phase Physical properties: outgassing, moisture absorption/diffusivity/swelling, others Toxicity and health concerns Cost, availability, lead time, and stable supply source Other Considerations (Composite Level) Material characterization data base Flight history Cost, availability, lead time, and stable source Fiber Selection The designer or material specialist has a wide range of fibers from which to make a selection. Often a fiber is selected because of physical properties. For example, graphite or carbon fibers are electrically and thermally conductive, while aramid (Kevlar®) and glass fibers are non-conductive. In certain applications, such as an antenna reflector, electrical conduction is required. Hence, graphite (carbon) fibers are generally chosen for reflector-type applications. In other applications, for example a radome, radar transmissibility is desired. Here, Kevlar® and glass fibers are the materials of choice. Fiber selection should also consider mechanical and thermal properties. The salient mechanical properties are modulus and strength. Those for thermal properties include coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and thermal conductivity. Table 2 presents typical properties of some commercially available fibers presently utilized for space and spacecraft structures. Table 2.

FOMs are ratios of composite material properties [references 5,6], for which the fibers may be unidirectional or cross plied depending on the application. Some typical FOMs are E/r, F/r, E/r/a, and Ek/r, where E, F, r, a, and k denote Young's modulus, strength, density, coefficient of thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity, respectively. Broadly speaking, most structural applications fall into two categories: strength critical and stiffness critical. The choice of fiber must be attuned to the driving design requirement of the application. For example, in primary structure, strength is usually the dominant factor influencing fiber selection. Therefore, F/r is the appropriate FOM for fiber selection. Whereas in secondary structure having vibration frequency and/or deflection requirements, stiffness may be the dominant selection factor. In this case E/r is the pertinent FOM. For dimensionally stable applications, E/r/a is the meaningful FOM. For thermal applications, Ek/r is a relevant FOM. Tensile strength and modulus are controlled principally by the fibers in the composite. Compressive and shear properties, however are derived from both the fiber and matrix and the interface (bond) between them. The thickness of a ply or layer is also determined by the fibers, more specifically the fiber diameter and the number of fibers in bundle or tow. Thin plies (2.5 mils or less) require low tow counts (500 to 1000 filaments), which are not available for some fibers. Ply flexibility, which is a function of fiber modulus and ply thickness, should be considered with respect to part curvature. For example, the brittleness and thickness of a ply with ultra-high modulus carbon fiber may preclude its use in fabricating a deeply curved part. The choice of fiber also can impact the type of reinforcement form possible. For example, ultra-high modulus graphite fibers may present weaving difficulties, which can preclude the availability of certain fabric styles with tight weaves. The availability of fabric woven with high-modulus fibers has improved greatly in the recent past. Lastly, fiber selection must consider wetting, bonding, and material compatibility of the matrix resin. A coating or sizing on the fibers is applied for these purposes. In material selection, one should be aware of the importance of a proper coupling agent between the fibers and resin. This is particularly important for carbon fibers. Coupling agents for carbon fibers are usually proprietary formulations of the fiber producer or the prepreg vendor. Reinforcement Form Choices of fiber reinforcement forms include unidirectional and multidirectional. Selection aspects of each form are discussed below. The most commonly used product containing unidirectional fiber reinforcement is prepreg tape. Unidirectional tape has collimated bundles of fibers called tows, which run in the length or long direction of the tape. Unidirectional tape gives the ability to tailor the fiber orientations from layer to layer in a laminate. This results in design flexibility. Also, the widest choice of fibers are available in unidirectional tape. Unidirectional tape is available in a range of widths. The choice of tape width can facilitate lay-up and can promote efficient material usage. An example of the latter is less wasted material from cutting ply pattern details. When laying up unidirectional tape, the continuity of the fibers should be maintained. End-to-end butt splices that result in fiber discontinuity should be avoided. On the other hand, butting the sides of adjacent layers with parallel fibers is permissible. Use of unidirectional tape to produce parts with deep, double curvature can prove difficult. Lay up may be facilitated by cutting the tape into narrow strips. However, labor increases in doing so. The most common multidirectional reinforcement form is woven fabric. Fabric weave styles can have drastically different draping characteristics, which is an important characteristic in making doubly-curved parts and those with integral flanges and bends. Harness-satin weaves are more drapable than plain weaves. Other desirable characteristics of fabrics include bidirectional properties at a minimum gage, resistance to microcracking (matrix splitting between fibers), and good machining characteristics. In a woven fabric, the fibers will be curved to some degree or another depending on the weave style. Fiber curvature results in decreased composite moduli and strengths, especially in compression. Weaving also reduces the volume available for fibers in the composite. As a result, laminates made from woven fabric composites are less structurally efficient than those made from unidirectional tapes. Recent manufacturing advancements have made possible ultra-thin unidirectional and fabric reinforced composites. These materials have been manufactured in a thickness of one mil or less for unidirectional prepreg and about two mils for fabric prepreg. Such ultra-thin composites are especially attractive for lightly-loaded, minimum gage structures. Here, the weight of the structure and, importantly, the weight savings potential of the composite are directly proportional to layer thinness. Other benefits of ultra-thin composites include less micro cracking under thermal cycling and the potential for more homogeneous laminate stacking sequences for a given laminate thickness. The latter usually results in improved strength due to a more thorough interspection of ply-angle orientations in the laminate stacking. The disadvantages of ultra-thin composites are increased handling difficulty, cost, and lead time. Fabric prepregs may offer labor efficiency in lay ups. For example, a [0/90] (Fiber angles are 0 degrees and 90 degrees) laminate needs 50% fewer plies to be laid up using an orthogonally woven fabric, since fibers in two directions are obtained with every ply applied. Some fabric prepregs are available with hybrid fibers, such as carbon warp-yarns and Kevlar® fill-yarns, which may provide more potential design solutions. Theoretically, the possibilities of fiber type and weave style are unlimited. Practically, off-the-shelf choices are limited. Certain non-standard fabrics made from high- and ultra high-modulus fibers can be obtained from specialty weavers. The design use of such fabrics should be tempered by cost and lead-time considerations. Matrix Selection The choice of prepreg matrix resin is of critical importance in fabrication. The composite part quality is extremely dependent on the resin matrix and its handling and cure processing characteristics. The matrix vendor is usually the vendor that makes the prepreg, i.e., incorporates the fibers in the matrix. Handling characteristics are most important during ply lay up. Here the tack and drape of the prepreg are critical properties. If the prepreg is too stiff and boardy, then difficulty will be encountered in making curved parts, such as hollow tubes. Maintenance of ply-to-ply fiber orientations can be affected as well. If the prepreg is too sticky, then positioning and, in particular, repositioning of layer during layup is difficult. The handling characteristics are affected by the cumulative exposure of the resin in the prepreg to room temperature. The time limit at room temperature is called the out-life of the prepreg. For large parts especially, outlife should be considered in resin selection. Some resins have out-lives as long as 30 days; others, only several days. The resin in the prepreg determines the cure temperature of a composite part. Most epoxies and polycyanates cure around either 250°F or 350°F. Polyimides cure at higher temperatures. The cure temperature usually determines the glass transition temperature (Tg), which is associated with the useful upper-temperature limit of a composite. (Prudent design practice is to limit the use of a composite to below its Tg. The safe number of degrees below Tg depends upon the magnitude and direction(s) of the applied load with respect to the laminate fiber directions. It is advisable to experimentally confirm the maximum usage temperature of a composite for a particular application.) A higher cure temperature or, alternatively, a post cure generally raises the Tg. However, a high cure temperature results in greater cool down or residual stresses, which arise from CTE mismatches: ply to ply and fiber to matrix. Also for elevated cure temperatures, the thermal expansion effects of cure tooling become more critical, which adds to the difficulty in making parts and achieving desired dimensions. Besides the cure temperature, the prepreg resin determines other important cure characteristics, such as rheology and viscosity. These characteristics affect consolidation of the layers, most notably in the amount of voids or porosity produced during cure. The choice of resin should be compatible with the consolidation process. For example, low-flow systems are usually unsuitable for vacuum-bag/oven processing. High-flow, low-viscosity systems can present difficulties in net-resin (no bleed) processing, since resin leakage may be difficult to prevent. The resin material also affects the contamination concerns of the composite: outgassing and moisture diffusivity. For space use, a polymeric composite must pass mass-loss and condensibles requirements, such as those defined in SP-R-0022A, MSFC-SPEC-1443 and JSC 0022-A. In addition, moisture absorbed on the ground will be desorbed in orbit. This may result in undesirable shrinkage for parts with strict dimensional stability requirements. The resin must have suitable shear and extensional modulus, strength, and strain for the composite to function correctly. Matrix shear is the mechanism through which stresses are introduced and spread to the fibers. Matrix shear and tensile strength largely factor into the resistance of an unidirectional layer in a laminate to microcracking from thermo-mechanical loads. Also, the resin must have compatible extensional strain with the fibers in the composite. Lastly, the resin material determines the toxicity of the prepreg. Resin systems with carcinogenic compounds and other unsafe ingredients should be avoided. Other Considerations These considerations deal with the economics and experience with a composite. Economic considerations include cost and availability (lead time). Experience considerations include extent of data bases and previous successful flight applications. Some space applications are given in publications [9] and [10]. The importance of the stability of the material supplier or vendor should also be taken into account, as a long term source of supply is highly desirable and sometimes essential. References: Z.

Benefits: Pre-ship review ensures the completeness and readiness of each item of hardware and, if applicable, any associated software or firmware, prior to release for shipment to another facility. By imposing this requirement, any discrepancies or unresolved problems may be identified and corrected while the item remains under supplier purview. This review is beneficial because it provides an independent assessment of product readiness by knowledgeable people not directly involved in the fabrication and test activity. Implementation Method: The purpose of pre-ship review (PSR) is to determine whether the required work on a planned deliverable is complete and acceptable and, where applicable, whether the flight qualification criteria have been attained. This includes checking that all required analyses and tests were performed and that the data package contains all the required documentation. Action is taken to assess the actual performance of the item against the performance requirements. Differences between the designed versus the built hardware are identified, and any additional risks associated with the differences are assessed. Any liens, concerns, unresolved problems, and open issues with the hardware or software are cataloged, and plans to resolve such open issues and complete any unfinished work are assessed. PSR requirements may apply to system contractors, subcontractors, and NASA centers; they are held prior to shipment to an integration or installation facility, a NASA center, the sponsor, or the launch site. System contractor requirements are written to specify PSR and to pass the requirement down to subcontractors. The PSR is performed by a review board and is a customer-controlled review. The review board assesses the status of the deliverable item, recommends whether or not to ship it, makes an independent judgement of the risks, and identifies any concerns which would affect mission success. A representative of the receiving organization is usually present at the review. The planning and documentation process for pre-ship and other technical reviews is described in Reliability Preferred Practice No. PD-ED- 1215.4, Common Review Methods for Engineering Products. The review agenda specific to PSRs typically includes the items listed in Table 1. Table 1 - Pre-Ship Review Agenda Prepare Final Compliance Matrix. Explain any incomplete requirements. Review completeness of all drawing specifications, including incorporation of all engineering change requests (ECRs). Explain any drawings or specifications that are not complete. Determine the status of required analyses-- their completion or plans to complete, and identify any open issues. Discuss and classify any residual risks. Determine the completion status of hardware assembly and verify that the hardware reflects the final completed drawings. Explain each discrepancy in the as-built hardware. Determine the status of required tests-- their completion or plans to complete, and identify any open issues. Discuss and classify any residual risks. Specify the status of required documentation, including plans to provide any documents that are not complete and in the data package. Provide plans to resolve any assurance liens. Identify any ECRs that have not been implemented in the as-built product.. Identify any problem/failure reports (or equivalent, customer-approved, supplier report formats) on the subject hardware (including electrical and mechanical ground support equipment) or software, as well as on other equipment which could affect it. Provide the plans for resolution. Assess any quotred flagquot problem/failure reports (PFRs)-- problems, residual risks, and actions taken to manage the risk of an in-flight occurrence. Catalog any waivers of product requirements, including the risk assessment associated with each. Evaluate the readiness of hardware to be integrated with other hardware or the spacecraft. Assess the readiness to ship hardware, including the adequacy of shipping containers, shipping methods, shipping environment control, and monitoring. Identify special instructions for item handling, testing, and training. Review plans for supplier participation after shipment.

Table 2 - Galileo Orbiter Attitude & Articulation Control System (AACS) Compliance Matrix [D] * Details on work remaining were explained in the PSR package; Source: Reference 3 (Vol. 2, p XVI-E3) Technical Rationale: Pre-ship review provides a last opportunity for the supplier and the customer to review completion of development work before the product leaves the facility. Correction of liens after this milestone usually has a major schedule impact. The planned increase in supplier participation in NASA programs will likely cause an increase in hardware built at supplier sites. Effective pre-ship controls will help ensure the success of NASA outsourcing plans.

Benefit: The benefit of using dual redundancy in critical KSC Ground Support Equipment (GSE) systems is greater assurance of successful system operation during critical shuttle processing operations in the event of a single equipment failure that would otherwise possibly cause loss of life, vehicle or damage to a vehicle system. By designing in redundancy for critical operations, the system can fail to a quotfail-safequot condition and still achieve operational objectives. Implementation Method: The Orbiter Access Arm (OAA) is a critical GSE system located at Launch Complex 39, Pads A and B, Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The OAA is extended shortly after the shuttle arrives at the launch pad to allow personnel access to the shuttle to make the necessary preparations for launch. Shortly before launch, the astronauts will board the shuttle via the OAA. The OAA provides the only path of ingress and egress to the space shuttle crew cabin for the astronauts. Thus, this system becomes critical to the safety of the crew. A critical system, as it applies to KSC GSE systems, is a system whose loss of overall system function, or improper performance of a system function, could result in loss of life, loss of the shuttle vehicle itself, or damage to a shuttle system. In addition, systems that have been identified as critical must be designed to be fail-safe. Fail-safe design provides the ability to sustain a critical system failure without causing loss of life, loss of the shuttle vehicle, or damage to a shuttle system. This includes the capability to safe the systems and successfully terminate operations, or if required, to continue operations through to completion. Therefore, the OAA system must be able to sustain a failure and still be able to perform its function to completion of the operation. In the event of a single system failure, it must fail to a safe condition, meaning a single failure will not result in loss of life, loss of the shuttle, or damage to a shuttle system. The critical condition is encountered when the OAA is retracted away from the shuttle at T-7:30 minutes in the countdown in preparation for launch. Should an emergency arise, either on board the shuttle or on the launch pad, during the final minutes of the countdown after the OAA is retracted, the OAA will need to be re-extended to allow the astronauts to evacuate the area as quickly as possible. Extension of the OAA is essential to the astronauts safety, as it is the only path available to the crew in the event evacuation of the shuttle is required. The astronauts lives depend on the OAA extending when needed. The probability of 2 redundant components failing during a critical time period is much less likely than 1 component failing during the same period. In the case of the OAA, 2 completely redundant sets of valves, plumbing, and electrical controls are installed. Based on the classical probability theory, assuming no common cause failures, it can be shown that through using dual redundancy the reliability of a system can be increased 1 or more orders of magnitude. Thus redundant system design provides protection against a single failure causing a hazardous condition resulting in loss of life, destruction of a shuttle or damage to a shuttle system. Technical Rationale: Redundancy is defined as multiple ways of performing a function. There are several different types of redundancy used on KSC GSE systems. Depending on the requirements of the application, the type of redundancy to be used will vary. The two primary types of redundancy are described below: Operational or Active quotfully onquot Redundancy - Redundant elements, all of which are fully energized during the system operating cycle. Operational redundancy includes load sharing redundancy wherein redundant elements are connected in such a manner that, on failure of one unit, the remaining redundant elements will continue to perform the system function. Switching out the failed element is not required. Operational redundancy may be either full parallel or quotmajority votequot. Standby Redundancy - A redundant hardware item(s) that are non-operative until they are switched into the system on failure of the primary item(s). Switching can be accomplished by either automatic or manual means. Other categorization of redundancy include: Like Redundancy - Identical hardware items performing the same function. Unlike Redundancy - Nonidentical hardware items performing the same function. Safety features which provide protection for specific failure modes are considered as unlike redundancy for that failure mode; i.e. relief valves which provide protection against overpressurization after failure of a regulator Typically, KSC employs parallel, two component redundancy. It can be shown that the incremental reliability gain is greatest for the first redundant unit and decreases rapidly as more redundant units are added in parallel. Figure 1 provides an example of a basic block diagram of the hydraulic extend circuit for the Orbiter Access Arm (OAA) showing the use of redundancy in a critical shuttle ground support system. [D] A hydraulic reservoir fills 4 hydraulic accumulators. Only 2 accumulators are needed to ensure arm retract and extend, but 2 additional (redundant) accumulators are provided for fail-safe operation in the event of a leak. In the event of a major leak, the launch countdown will stop. If a major leak occurs during an emergency re-extend operation, the 2 redundant accumulators should supply enough hydraulic pressure to ensure full extension of the OAA. In addition, the hydraulic supply system is capable of supplying additional pressure if required. The ensuing discussion will address the primary system only. Design of the system minimizes the likelihood of a common cause failure. The accumulators provide hydraulic fluid to a pilot valve (Primary Hydraulic Extend Pilot Valve) and to the main hydraulic supply valve (Primary Hydraulic Extend Supply Valve). When commanded by LPS (Launch Processing System), the pilot valve supplies hydraulic pressure to the Primary Hydraulic Extend Supply Valve and to the Primary Hydraulic Extend Return Valve, thus opening both valves. Hydraulic fluid from the accumulators then flows thru the Primary Hydraulic Extend Supply Valve to the upper and lower OAA hinges. Each hinge is individually capable of rotating the OAA. Thus the hinges are redundant. Fluid exits the OAA hinges, and returns to the main hydraulic reservoir through the Primary Hydraulic Extend Return Valve. This discussion described the basic operation of the primary hydraulic extend circuit for the OAA. There is a secondary (redundant) set of valves as described above installed in parallel with the primary valves, that simultaneously operate. Operational redundancy ensures that the OAA will operate when needed. A single failure will not result in a catastrophic consequence.

Such effects include inadvertent ignition of electroexplosive devices, spurious triggering of electronics, and damage to insulating materials. The ignition, by electrostatic discharge, of the final stage solid rocket motor of the Delta launch vehicle for the Orbiting Solar Observatory spacecraft during test operations killed three men in 1964. Electrostatic discharges previously had ignited a similar motor without loss of life. In addition, failures of several vehicles after launch have been attributed to electrostatic discharges. Electrostatic discharges in the atmosphere can have adverse effects on launch operation. NASA SP-8084, revision of June 1974, gives models that should be applied to electrostatic problems. The lightning strikes on Apollo 12, shortly after liftoff, caused major disturbances to on-board electrical systems. Fortunately, most of the effects in this case were of a temporary nature and the mission was able to continue. To be effective, a program to minimize the hazards of the electrostatic discharges must be instituted early in the design phase and must consider all aspects of the design, test, launch, and operations of the launch vehicle, spacecraft, and experiments.","Practice: Provide protection against electrostatic charges, discharges, and lightning strikes by shielding and bonding space systems, structures, and their components in accordance with Standard Payload Assurance Requirements (SPAR-3) for GSFC Orbital Projects.

Benefit: The Earth's space environment (geospace) is uniquely comprised of dynamic and complex regions of interacting plasmas, ionized particles, magnetic fields and electrical currents. Proper grounding/bonding of the space vehicle's shell and its electronic equipment can provide protection against lightning strikes in geospace, and also can eliminate or control most of its internal electrical and electrostatic hazards. This results in lower failure rates and significant reliability and safety enhancement of space systems and space vehicles. Implementation Method: For space vehicles all sections of the vehicle's outer shell should be bonded together to permit large quantities of electric charge to distribute across the shell by conducting paths. The bonded shell of the space vehicle then acts as an electrical shield to protect internal structures from lightning and atmospheric electricity. Ground wires should be used for individual systems when appropriate. Wires should be adequate to carry a surge without mechanical damage. NASA has established lightning protection requirements for design, and procedures to demonstrate that these requirements are implemented for the Space Shuttle program in NASA document NSTS 07636, which is a subtier to NSTS 07700, Volume X. NSTS 07636 defines the conducted current lightning environment for design, and imposes the requirements that the design must satisfy to ensure the protection of the Space Shuttle from the direct and indirect effects of lightning. A practical approach to lightning protection problems is presented in the appendices of NSTS 07636, which are: Appendix A, ""Conducted Current Lightning Environment""; Appendix B, ""Lightning Strike Zones""; Appendix C, ""Test Waveforms and Methods""; Appendix D, ""Methods for Estimating the Internal Induced Voltage and Current Environment""; Appendix E, ""Analysis Methodology"", and Appendix F, ""Lightning Bonds"". Bonding and grounding requirements are defined in MIL-B-5087B(ASG), ""Bonding, Electrical, and Lightning Protection for Aerospace Systems"". Table 1 provides typical classifications for electrical bonds from that document. TABLE 1. Electrical Bond Classes of Application1 CLASS APPLICATION MIL-B-5087B(ASG) REFERENCE PARAGRAPH A Antenna installation 3.3.1 C Current path return 3.3.2 H Shock hazard 3.3.3 L Lightning protection 3.3.4 R Rf potentials 3.3.5 S Static charge 3.3.6 1Where a single bond is used to serve two or more classes of application, the design shall conform to the most critical requirement of bonding. Class L bonding requirements are designed to achieve protection against lightning discharge current carried between the extremities of an airborne vehicle without risk of damaging flight controls or producing sparking or voltages within the vehicle in excess of 500 volts. These requirements are based upon a lightning current waveform of 200,000 amperes peak, a width of 5 to 10 microseconds at the 90% point, not less than 20 microseconds width at the 50% point, and a rate of at least 100,000 amperes per microsecond. Test requirements are described in MIL-STD-1757A, ""Lightning Qualification Test Techniques for Aerospace Vehicles and Hardware"" (The term ""aerospace vehicles"" includes fixed/variable wing aircraft, helicopters, missles, and spacecraft.) This document presents a set of standard test waveforms and techniques for lightning qualification testing of aerospace vehicles and hardware. The test waveforms presented in this document are intended to reproduce the significant effects of the natural environment and are therefore independent of vehicle type or configuration. The tests include high voltage and high current physical damage tests of fuel, structural and electrical hardware, as well as indirect effects associated with lightning strikes to externally mounted electrical hardware. The capability to test hardware and design concepts in a lightning environment has been very limited in the past. However, there are presently test facilities that are able to generate and simulate the levels of voltage, current and charge transfers typical of lightning phenomena. Therefore full scale, full threat lightning tests that meet the requirements of MIL-STD-1757A and NSTS 07636 are now available. Technical Rationale: LIGHTNING ENVIRONMENT. The currents in a lightning flash are conveniently separated into three categories: Return stroke surges with peak currents of up to 200,000 amps or more and with durations on the order of tens of microseconds. Intermediate currents of up to 10,000 amps or more and with durations on the order of milliseconds. Continuing currents of up to 1000 amps and with durations on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. Intermediate and continuing currents are primarily responsible for damage such as hole-burning while return stroke currents mainly produce explosive effects and indirect effects. There are also currents associated with subsequent return strokes and there are phases of return strokes characterized by rapid rates of change. These categories are represented by idealized waveforms designated A,B,C,D, and H. These waveforms and their mathematical definitions are described in Appendix A of NSTS 07636E. The accumulation of electrostatic charges on the electrically isolated bodies could lead to a number of results that might affect the success of a space mission. Breakdown occurs when the electric field exceeds the dielectric strength of the medium. Charge then crosses the dielectric between oppositely-charged bodies. Heat and electromagnetic energy are emitted with the passage of the charge. Besides the electric field strength imposed on the medium, the occurrence and severity of the discharge depend on system geometry and secondary discharge effects. The gaseous medium that surrounds the components of a space vehicle is particularly vulnerable to breakdown in altitudes around 30 km. The dielectric strength of the atmosphere passes through a minimum at the reduced pressures associated with those altitudes. The various field strengths that might be present on the space vehicle can cause atmospheric breakdown. Breakdown could still be possible at much higher altitudes or even in orbit because of residual gases and outgassing materials in the space vehicle that could increase the localized gas pressure until it reached the breakdown region. Air launched spacecraft such as Pegasus must minimize tribo-electric charging even during fair weather. This is done by conductive surfaces and/or discharge wicks. This is of particular concern when composite fairings are used. Breakdown of the gaseous medium occurs when the electric fields on the vehicle are strong enough to break apart the atoms or molecules of the medium into ions and electrons that then move according to the voltage gradient. If recombination takes place before the ions or electrons impinge on their respective electrodes, the breakdown is considered a partial one and is designated corona. If the gaseous ions impinge on both electrodes, then breakdown of the dielectric between them is complete and is referred to as arcing or an arc discharge.

Benefit: The probability of structural failure during launch and landing is significantly reduced. Implementation Method: Loads due to various sources (steady-state acceleration, transient dynamic, vibro-acoustic) may be computed separately. Then use one of the combination methods listed below to derive the combined load. For acoustically sensitive components, direct acoustic load should be included as well. Technical Rationale: Vibration which causes structural loads can be classified as follows (see Table 1): Vibration due to transient events (liftoff, staging, etc.), typically below 60 Hz, including steady-state acceleration; Random vibration transmitted through mechanical interfaces, typically from 20 to 2000 Hz; Random vibration caused by direct acoustic loading on the surface of the structure, typically from 50 to 10,000 Hz. For primary structure, the steady-state and transient loads typically dominate the vibro-acoustic loads, and the latter are often ignored in practice. For secondary structure, however, the vibro-acoustic loads can be comparable to, or larger than, the steady-state and transient loads. Acoustically sensitive components may have loads which are dominated by their response to direct acoustic excitation. Because the transient and vibro-acoustic loads can be of comparable magnitude, and both are present simultaneously at liftoff, it can be unconservative to design the structure to the transient and vibro-acoustic loads separately. A number of methods are available for assessing the combined load. The following methods are considered acceptable. Method 1: Coupled Transient Analysis with Base Drive Random Depending on the launch vehicle, coupled transient analysis predicts structural loads up to 60 Hz, although in most cases the frequency cutoff is much lower (35 Hz for STS liftoff). Forcing functions for these analyses are adjusted, based on flight data, to assure that the loads envelop the actual flight loads (including transient and mechanically transmitted random vibrations within the frequency range of analysis). Above the cutoff frequency of the coupled transient analysis, mechanically transmitted random vibration loads may be computed using base drive random analysis of the payload structure. The base vibration is specified in terms of power spectral densities of the acceleration in each direction. If possible, the analysis should be performed using input accelerations corresponding to the time of peak transient loads, rather than the maximum random vibration over the entire flight. Accelerations in different directions should be considered uncorrelated, and may be applied simultaneously or one direction at a time. A higher level of damping is acceptable for the random analysis than for the coupled transient. Common practice is to use 3 times the RMS (3 sigma) as the peak load prediction. Peak loads from the coupled transient and base drive random analyses may be combined by a root-sum-square (RSS) approach. When direct acoustic loading on the payload structure is non-negligible, it may be combined with the above load using an RSS approach. Methods for predicting acoustic loading include finite-element based approaches, which are limited to low frequency predictions, and statistical energy methods, which are limited to higher frequency predictions. Method 2: Mass Acceleration Curve A typical mass acceleration curve (MAC) is shown in Figure 1. The MAC is an upper bound acceleration level for all components of a given mass, regardless of location, orientation, or frequency. Applicability is limited to appendage masses up to 500 kg, with frequencies up to approximately 100 Hz. Such a curve can be derived based on analytical and flight data, and includes the effects of both transient and mechanically transmitted random vibration. That is, the load predicted by the curve is already a combination of transient and random vibration. When direct acoustic loading is non-negligible, it may be combined with the MAC load using an RSS approach. Method 3: Coupled Transient Analysis with Modal MAC It is generally accepted that base drive random analysis can be very conservative, because it does not account for impedance effects. These effects can be very significant for the payload modes with large effective mass. An approach which accounts for impedance in an approximate way is based on application of the MAC to the modes of the payload structure. Each mode of the payload may be assigned an acceleration level based on its effective mass. The acceleration level is taken from a curve similar to Figure 1, but the modal MAC is typically lower in level than the MAC which applies to physical appendage masses. Physical loads corresponding to each mode are then derived by scaling the mode shape according to this level. The combined load is obtained as the RSS of the transient load with the modal loads above the transient cutoff frequency. It can be seen that this method is the same as Method 1, except that the base drive random approach is replaced by an RSS of modal loads scaled to the modal MAC. As in the previous two methods, when direct acoustic loading is non-negligible, it should be computed by an appropriate acoustic analysis method, and combined with the transient and random load using the RSS approach.

No other check was conducted to reverify the integrity of the system after disconnection and reconnection of the line was completed. Landing gear stowage was never identified as a critical process. No special steps were taken to ensure the readiness of this system for flight. During the gear stowage process, there was no record of checking off steps or evidence of cross-checking of work by another person. Distraction or interruption of the mechanical technician during gear stowage operations may have contributed to the nonconnection of the brake line. The design of the DC-XA vehicle and operational procedures were driven by rapid development and low cost. Accordingly, a minimum number of personnel were involved in operations. Also, design was single string, and there was just one flight test vehicle. There was strong reliance on good people but not a lot of margin for human error afforded by the vehicle preparation process. Rapid Prototyping Guidelines or implementation thereof for the DC-XA may have gone too far in the direction of sacrificing quality and reliability. This rapid prototyping concept should be revisited from an operations perspective.","Critical procedural steps should be identified during systems design and flagged as critical in vehicle operations procedures. Then, independent verification of all critical steps should be performed during execution of operations procedures.

Following an uneventful takeoff, the Clipper Graham flew for 104 seconds reaching an altitude of 4100 feet and traveling 2800 feet up range before returning to the concrete landing pad, successfully completing all test objectives. Ninety-eight seconds into the flight and at approximately 400 feet, the DC-XA computer commanded landing gear deployment. Over the next five seconds, three of the four legs successfully deployed. Four seconds after the gear deploy command, landing gears 1 and 4 deployed within one-tenth of a second of each other. Then, landing gear 3 deployed one full second later. Landing gear 2 never deployed. Descending from 400 feet, the spacecraft landed safely on three of its four legs. When the weight-on-gear indication was received at 13:17:27 MDT, the engines terminated as programmed and at 13:17:29 MDT, the vehicle toppled toward the position of landing gear 2. Upon impact, the vehicle was destroyed in a series of three explosions spaced over the next 90 seconds. The first explosion at 13:17:30 MDT ignited the composite shell and the avionics rack. At 13:17:40 MDT, ten seconds after the initial explosion, the fire suppression system began dispensing water. A second explosion of liquid oxygen from the aluminum-lithium tank rocked the mishap scene ten seconds after the first explosion. The fire suppression system shut down after the tank ran out of water but before complete fire extinction. Approximately 1 minute after the second explosion, the hydrogen tank exploded. This third explosion scattered the composite material from the aeroshell and hydrogen tank over the mishap scene. The Clipper Graham DC-XA vehicle was totally destroyed by ground impact and ensuing explosions and fires. The vehicle struck the ground on the corner of the vehicle at the undeployed landing gear 2. The upper two-thirds of the composite aeroshell, aluminum-lithium liquid oxygen tank, composite liquid hydrogen tank, composite intertank, avionics, nose cone, and parachute recovery systems were destroyed during the three explosions and ensuing fire. Parts of landing gears 3 and 4 were melted in the fire as well. Landing gears 2 and 1 mechanisms were damaged during the tip over and ensuing fires and explosions. The lower one-third of the vehicle aeroshell, containing the throttlable RL-10 engines and the auxiliary propulsion system, were charred and covered with soot. The RL-10 engines and auxiliary propulsion system were the only items appearing to be recoverable. Videotapes of the flight and still photographs of the wreckage showed that landing gear 2 failed to deploy. This failure was also evident in the helium supply pressure time history. NASA analysts at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) performed a helium pressure decay study and showed the loss of helium to be greater than expected after the start of gear deployment. Also, they estimated the diameter of the hole in the pneumatic system that would be required to achieve the observed helium pressure decay rate. This analysis indicated that if the brake line was disconnected during landing gear deployment, the decay rate would be equivalent to that which was recorded by the flight instrumentation. Also, post mishap inspection found the landing gear to be stowed and the pneumatic brake line not connected. Therefore, the primary cause of the vehicle mishap was that the brake line on the helium pneumatic system for landing gear 2 was not connected. This unconnected brake line prevented the brake mechanism from being pressurized to release the brake and resulted in landing gear 2 not extending. The vehicle became unstable upon landing, toppled onto its side, exploded, and burned.",,,,"Aeronautics Research, Exploration Systems",Public,Not Specified,,11/2/1999,,use,

Following each orbit-raising maneuver, and until the final burn, this results in propellant transfer from those tanks with check valves having the highest reseat pressures to the tanks with check valves having the lowest. Since orbit raising on this specific mission was done while spinning, this moved the spacecraft spin axis closer to the fuller tanks, which may have resulted in yet further propellant transfer. Differential heating or cooling of the tanks can add to the propellant migration problem. In addition to changing spacecraft dynamics, this transfer of mass may limit the spacecraft's on-orbit life because pressurant gas instead of propellant will be drawn from the first tank to be depleted, leading to early engine shutdown. For interplanetary spacecraft with a similar configuration, such as the Mars 98 lander, propellant transfer or differential draw during cruise may cause dynamic imbalance and/or reduction of useable propellant.

The failure was attributed to an inherited design of the rib retention mechanism. Recommendations involved the design of preloaded mechanisms, lubricant selection and use, hardware robustness, and fault tolerant design of one-shot, non-redundant, mechanisms.","Design changes intended to improve the reliability of inherited hardware may introduce new failure mechanisms. The mission impact of such design changes may best be understood through a ""physics of failure"" approach to reliability analysis. Failure physics issues relevant to antenna support bearings, for example, may include oxidation, cold welding, galling, static and sliding friction, lubrication transfer, Hertzian contact stresses, and plastic deformation, as well as operational issues such as long-term storage, ground handling, the mission environment, and mission duration.","In the design of preloaded mechanisms, consider the potential for high contact stresses on pin/socket interfaces to destroy the integrity of the lubricant film. Take into account the potential for lubricant effectiveness to decrease over time. Due to its high wear rate in air, carefully evaluate the use of molybdenum disulfide drylube on a mechanism that will be tested or operated under non-vacuum conditions. Hardware should be inheritently robust or redesigned to accommodate major changes in spacecraft system design, changes in spacecraft handling or the mission profile. Inheritance, design and peer reviews should fully consider the effect of such changes on known failure mechanisms. One-shot, non-redundant, mechanisms should be designed for simplicity and fault tolerance-particularly where the mechanisms are preloaded prior to long-term storage, or where they endure extended periods under atmospheric and vacuum conditions prior to actuation.",JPL,1/16/1997,"In April 1991, the Galileo spacecraft executed a deployment sequence which was to open the High Gain Antenna (HGA) like an umbrella, but it never reached the fully deployed position. A formal failure investigation attributed the failure to the design of the rib retention mechanism. According to this scenario, the most likely failure mechanism is friction in the pin/socket interface on the antenna rib midpoint restraint. Preloading of the ribs when the antenna was stowed at the factory damaged the ceramic coating on the pin engaged by the V-groove socket; the coating served to retain the molybdenum disulfide dry lubricant. Accumulated stresses from vibration testing, rib preloading, four cross-country trips, and the post-launch ignition of the upper stage further dispersed the lubricant film. The resulting friction caused asymmetrical deployment, resulting in restraining forces which further reduced the torque available from the deployment drive system. The HGA was largely inherited from an antenna developed for the Tracking Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) system. JPL design changes included substitution of two conical Inconel pin sockets with one conical and one V-groove Inconel socket. Selection of an Earth orbital antenna design, even though proven in that application, was not fully consistent with the Galileo mission. Inheritance and other design reviews failed to reveal the existence of high surface stresses. In addition, a lessons learned on Voyager II to use spring assisted mechanical deployments was not followed. The deep space mission subjected the redesigned antenna to environmental conditions not encountered by TDRS in Earth orbit, and the VEEGA mission profile instituted after Challenger extended both the duration of those conditions and the time to deployment. Galileo illustrates the difficulty of reproducing the spaceflight environment in the ground test of large and complex mechanisms, even when full design review and environmental testing are undertaken. Flight antenna deployment test failed to disclose the problem because (1) vacuum test was performed without the vibration-induced relative motion between the pins and sockets and (2) oxides and contaminants present during ground test on the bare titanium pins lubricated the mechanism. Similarly, ambient ground tests did not reveal the failure mode due to the lower coefficient of friction of the titanium pin/socket interface in air. Additional testing of the deployment mechanism would only have worn out the deployment drive system. Work-arounds using the Low Gain Antenna, new data compression techniques, and the spacecraft's recorder are expected to meet 70 percent of the mission objectives.

Although this is an uncommon event, shallow water blackout potentially can cause serious injury or death in as little as six feet of water. One of the greatest concerns of breath holding during a free dive is unconsciousness during ascent. When the diver descends, the air in his lungs is compressed, raising the oxygen partial pressure. This partial pressure increase of oxygen (PPO2) satisfies the bodies oxygen demand during descent and while on the bottom. During ascent, the remaining partial pressure of oxygen is reduced rapidly as the hydrostatic pressure on the body lessens.

Thus any two gyros together provided the required three axis data, plus a fourth, redundant set of data about an axis common to both gyros. The third gyro acted as backup. The gyros, not needed until just before separation from the Titan/Centaur, were left ""on"" and thus warmed up during launch to ensure immediate readiness. The failure protection logic, also left enabled during launch, sensed failure by comparing the output of the axis common to both controlling gyros. If not equal, the ""back-up"" replaced one controlling gyro. If still not equal, the gyros were switched again. Continued inequality among all possible gyro pairs caused the logic to look elsewhere for the problem. It was understood a priority that the gyro output would ""saturate"" during launch, and that this saturation output would be at equal limiting values, thus ensuring a valid logic comparison. Instead, however, the output oscillated significantly, causing a mis-comparison.

Within six orbits after observance of the anomaly, communication with the spacecraft was found not to be possible and no downlink signal from the spacecraft was thereafter detected. Upon closer examination of recorded spacecraft telemetry data, it was ascertained that the solar array was putting out electrical power, but that no power was being provided to the battery charging unit, and the batteries were not receiving a charge. Cause of the failure surmised by the cognizant operations crew and concluded by the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) NOAA-13 Failure Review Board, was that the solar array bus had shorted to spacecraft ground.

Even higher equilibrium temperatures were anticipated as the mission progressed. The apparent solar absorptance increase (derived from the flight temperatures) for MGN is generally global and appears to be approximately twice that expected based on known data bases. Fairly recent theoretical and experimental work shows the possibility that contaminants (organic molecules in particular) outgassed by the spacecraft and/or solar panels may be the cause of increased absorptance (through interaction with solar ultraviolet radiation) and thus higher temperatures. The MGN effect may be due to the greater ultraviolet energy at Venusian solar distances compared to Earth (about 2 solar constants). The MGN solar panels received only minimal outgassing prior to flight (20 hours). The impacts of these high subsystem temperatures were significant. Extensive unplanned analyses and mission planning activities were required, including spacecraft attitudes to prevent even higher temperatures, and some mapping science was lost. Were it not for the confidence gained during the solar thermal vacuum test at these higher temperatures, significantly more science would have been lost. The long life of MGN is certainly threatened: concerns exist for both electronic part life and solder joint fatigue.

The failure occurred when a flight operations software command loss routine switched the S/C configuration from Receiver 1 to Receiver 2. Receiver 1 had operated normally from launch until the inadvertent switch to Receiver 2 and subsequent controlled switch back to Receiver 1. The Receiver 1 power converter failed 11 seconds after the switch back. Other subsystem telemetry was also noted to be anomalous during this short time. Receiver 2 on first use after the inadvertent switch was discovered to have a shorted loop capacitor and thus unable to lock to normal uplink. After the Receiver 1 failure, the spacecraft switched Receiver 2 on. Receiver 2 has subsequently continued to support the mission. Its use required special Deep Space Network (DSN) uplink acquisition tuning procedures and periodic in-flight receiver best lock frequency checks to compensate for the failed loop capacitor. The analysis indicates that the short circuit within Receiver 1 was screws.

The transmitter outputs are 1, 10, and 30 watts. When the Orbiter and Lander are mated, there is only a small separation between the Lander relay transmitter antenna and the Orbiter relay receiver antenna. The analysts realized that at the higher relay transmitter output levels, the relay receiver would be subject to an overload condition and could suffer possible damage. Prelaunch tests of the antenna geometry and Orbiter/Lander mated tests were insufficient because of limited modeling capability, nonflight conditions, and noisy environments. To verify a working Lander transmitter output before the first descent to Mars surface, an in-flight test was essential. Engineers, working at the bounds of analysis with nonlinear telemetry, deemed a 10-watt test safe. Because of parameter tolerance buildup, they could not guarantee damage-free testing at the 30-watt level. Therefore, the project decided the critical Lander-1 Mars-descent data would be transmitted at 10 watts, thereby accepting the risk of some data loss due to atmospheric fading.

The increased Mercury to Earth range, relative to first Mercury encounter, required (1) a communications improvement of at least one dB over the performance obtained at the first Mercury encounter, and (2) commitment by the MVM '73 project to a bit error rate higher than .0333. The Telecommunications Division and the Deep Space Network (DSN) worked together to devise an arraying scheme to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This consisted of real-time arraying of DSS-14, DSS-13, and DSS-12 at Goldstone through microwave connections. Testing one week before encounter showed a signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 0.8 dB; the actual improvement on encounter day was 1.0 dB. In addition, non real-time arraying of the signals from DSS-14 at Goldstone and DSS-43 at Canberra was to be attempted. This would consist of combining the tape-recorded signals from each of these stations to gain additional signal-to-noise ratio. This was accomplished at the DSN's Compatibility Test Area 21 and in the Division 33 Telecommunications Development Laboratory. The bit error rate achieved in real time met the .0333 criterion for more than five hours during the encounter.

Requirements creep brought about by the combination of the two projects led to confusion over the implementation of the memorandum of understanding (MOU), and a subsequent internal memo that was mistakenly distributed to a wide audience with unintended consequences. This case study serves to illustrate requirements creep and the necessity for clear and open communications on technical projects.

Carefully structure buyer-supplier relationships to avoid dual roles in the government of both buyer and subtier “vendor” supplier",MSFC,8/1/1997,"The FASTRAC engine project was initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of low cost engine development, give early career propulsion engineers hands-on hardware experience and end-to-end design experience, grow the experience base of propulsion systems engineering, and enable the NASA propulsion community to become a “smart buyer” for future propulsion systems. Commercial, off-the-shelf technologies and common manufacturing methods were adapted to broaden competition and aid in producing lower cost hardware. Development of the FASTRAC engine would institutionalize future rocket development projects and flight hardware procurement activities. NASA had been studying the Bantam booster at the time as a low cost launch vehicle. The Bantam vehicle was designed around a propulsion test article to be used to test FASTRAC engines at Stennis. The requirements for the test configuration correlated between FASTRAC and the Bantam Booster. Rather far along in the development of the FASTRAC engine, NASA selected a contractor to integrate a flight demonstration vehicle from another program, X-34, with the FASTRAC engine. NASA signed a memorandum of understanding with the contractor who was given lead responsibility for vehicle design, fabrication, integration, and initial flight testing for powered flight of the X-34 test vehicle. MSFC was to develop the engine for the X-34. The original engine requirements did not correlate with the X-34 vehicle requirements and the dynamics of the contract structure led to misunderstandings between MSFC, the contractor, and NASA headquarters.

Where justified by the orbit or other factors, consider placing propellant tanks destined for Earth orbit behind structural elements.","Propulsion system designers may not be aware of the recent update to the debris model (Reference (2)), which is yielding a higher estimate of MMOD risk to exposed propellant tanks on Earth orbiters. An MLI blanket may no longer provide sufficient protection.","Depending on the orbit and other factors, consider placing metal or composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) propellant tanks destined for Earth orbit behind structure. Such “structure” may be furnished by the existing spacecraft structure, or by a dedicated tank cover. In addition to decommissioning the tanks, assure the safing of other stored energy sources (e.g., battery, reaction wheels, etc.) as required (Reference (4)) for any planned post-mission spacecraft disposal operation.",JPL,5/10/2016,"Unenclosed propellant tanks on satellites in Earth orbit have long been a concern due to the risk of orbital debris colliding with the tanks. Propellant tanks in deep space too may need additional protection beyond that provided by the tank structure, depending on the severity of the micrometeoroid flux and the spacecraft orientation along the spacecraft trajectory (Reference (1). For Earth-orbiting spacecraft, however, additional design measures to protect propulsion systems may be goaded by a recently updated NASA orbital debris model (ORDEM). The most recent version of the model (Reference (2)) provides a larger set of observational data on the orbital debris environment (debris spatial density, flux, etc.) than found in the 2001 release of ORDEM 2.0— new data that suggests spacecraft will incur a higher risk of damage. In addition to the increased debris in space and the higher risk to orbiters documented in the revised model, NASA policies related to debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) became more stringent in 2007 (Reference (3)). For Earth orbiters, particle strikes on propellant tanks comprise two failure modes: The impact will cause a breach in the tank, leading to a loss of propellant that may shorten or end the mission. The strike will cause an explosion or catastrophic failure of the tank, resulting in both mission termination and an addition to the orbital debris field. This added debris may increase the risk to other spacecraft.1 Mitigation of the micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) risk has typically involved adding multi-layer insulation (MLI) shielding to the tanks. Because Reference (2) adds steel debris to the ORDEM model, making MLI ineffective as a shielding wall, the SMAP project considered additional protection measures. Launched in January 2015, SMAP measures soil moisture and freeze-thaw state using a lightweight, deployable, reflector antenna system that rotates around the nadir axis and makes conical scans of the Earth’s surface. A spherical titanium propellant tank (Figure 1) equipped with an elastomeric diaphragm expulsion device held 81 kilograms of hydrazine at launch, was pressurized pre-launch, and is operated in (mono-propellant) blowdown mode throughout the 3-year or longer mission. Figure 1. SMAP propellant tank after installation at JPL In the original design, the SMAP propellant tank was only partially enclosed by the spacecraft structure, with the expulsion outlet and dome oriented outward, and with an offset thermal blanket attached to the surface of the tank. This left the tank exposed at the base via the open end of the launch vehicle interface (Figure 2). Figure 2. Cutaway of spacecraft structure showing the location of the propellant tank. The underside of the tank is exposed to space At Preliminary Design Review (PDR), it was estimated that the spacecraft would be in compliance with NASA requirements; i.e., it would have a 99 percent probability of surviving MMOD through post-mission disposal (Reference (4)). However, the initial analysis of the risk of impact-induced tank rupture showed the risk was not in compliance. Because the SMAP spacecraft design had an adequate mass margin, and because it was destined for an orbit with a high debris flux, JPL decided to add a hemispherical aluminum tank cover to protect the tank (Figure 3). Figure 3. MMOD shield (purple domed structure) covering the SMAP propellant tank, viewed through the (green) launch vehicle adapter ring. 1Mitigating the impact of a strike by venting the pressurant gas when the spacecraft is decommissioned is infeasible because the helium is behind a bladder. Adding a pressurant vent valve to the design is an option, but it would add to propulsion system complexity and might introduce new failure modes.

A July 2013 antenna boom deployment test displayed unexpected asymmetric deployment, large lateral deflections of a batten truss element, and loads that may have exceeded the batten flight limit loads. Six lessons and associated recommendations are drawn from development and test of this critical flight system element.","Reference (2) summarizes the lessons learned from development and test of the SMAP RBA: The Deployable Reflector is a critical element in an Integrated Flight System. A deployable reflector is a major consideration for practically all aspects of spacecraft configuration. It needs to fit the launch vehicle in the stowed configuration, deploy without obstruction, and allow unobstructed illumination of solar panels and unobstructed fields of view of instruments and telecom antennas, etc. The large flexible nature of the deployed antenna produces vibration modes (of order 1 Hz or lower) and could potentially couple with fuel slosh modes, solar array modes, or deployable boom modes. Sudden thermal transients that appear when crossing the terminator can produce dynamic disturbances. A large deployable reflector imposes constraints and special conditions on mission operational scenarios such as deployment (typically conducted with the Attitude Control System (ACS) idled, and constrained by power availability as the spacecraft tumbles off-sun during deployment), slews for calibration, tumble recovery maneuvers, etc. Verification and validation by analysis is required. Verification by testing only will not suffice. V&V of the integrated system under environmental conditions cannot be accomplished by testing alone, a characteristic of large deployable structures that is shared by systems such as planetary Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL). The structures are simply too large for most facilities, too strongly influenced by Earth’s gravity, or too costly to make testing a viable option. Important exceptions (where test is viable) include system-level environmental testing with the deployable in the stowed configuration, and first-motion and possibly full deployment tests of the structure alone at room temperature and possibly under vacuum, assisted by gravity-offload test fixtures. Validation of many project requirements requires extensive use of models, and the models themselves need to be validated. Waivers to established test practices should be developed early in a project’s lifecycle. The waivers should explain anticipated exceptions and planned mitigations, and provide a documented risk assessment and institutional approvals. The waivers should be updated throughout development. Be critical of heritage claims, as each deployable reflector will be a custom implementation. Although the deployable structure will exhibit heritage elements, and previous performance will be important in selecting a vendor partner, such factors as the choice of launch vehicle are likely to cause design changes-- even for reflectors of the same diameter. Scaling in structure size can generate emergent behaviors which are not understood until testing, at which time they could seriously threaten the technical performance and schedule. Even minor modifications to heritage components or to functional performance can significantly change system behavior. Vendor heritage can also be threatened by changes in vendor personnel and technical capabilities. Critical examination of the heritage of models, test fixtures, ground support equipment, and manufacturing capabilities is also needed The depth of the vendor/partner capabilities is important. During the source selection process, consideration should be given to the engineering and production capacity of the candidate suppliers for the scope of work being considered, including engineering capacity, manufacturing capacity, quality assurance, acquisition, management, contracts, personnel, facilities and key equipment. Projects should forecast the suppliers’ management, engineering, and production and test resource capacity to accommodate possible scope or complexity growth as the job evolves over time. Determine how much of vendor capacity the project consumes, whether the company is gaining critical talent or losing it, if the vendor has multiple customers, and how the customer mission ranks in priority against other customers’ deliveries. There were previous projects that involved a known, once competent vendor, but where the vendor’s current capabilities proved questionable-- such as the Dawn ion engines and the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) actuators. Vendor partner management practices contributed to the difficulties. The vendor organization structure can aid or hinder system development. Also, the RBA contractor’s test processes did not provide as strong attention to early ground test and deployment modeling as was warranted. Carefully planned contract details can ease off-nominal situations. Vague or permissive language in contract SOWs and CDRLs can lead to delays in discovering vendor performance problems. Even when contract requirements are clearly written, however, additional JPL engagement may aid in attaining full vendor employee awareness of what JPL expects from them—and the rationale. Reference (3) provides another perspective on what worked well and what didn't work well in SMAP RBA development.","Reference (2) summarizes the findings from development and test of the SMAP RBA: 1. As a critical element in an integrated flight system, the Deployable Reflector requires exceptional scrutiny in design and test: The project should expect that a large deployable reflector will create the need for design, analysis, and possibly testing iterations among the deployable structure, the mission, the instrument, the flight system, and the launch vehicle elements. The project should subject complex, single-use, deployables design and test to a similar depth of engineering penetration as used for EDL (Entry, Descent and Landing) on planetary missions. 2. Verification and validation by analysis is required for complex deployables, and partner capabilities should be verified and certified: The JPL team should review the subcontractor’s models and simulations, and JPL may elect to conduct independent modeling and simulation. All significant models should be identified, and a careful distinction should be made as to which models are mission critical. Models are considered critical when they are the primary means of design or the primary means for requirement verification. Mission critical models should be tracked at the Project System Engineer (PSE) level. A clear process for model development should be documented, and validation tests developed, reviewed, planned and executed. Engage mechanical systems engineers as leaders and owners of the deployable models; routine finite element modeling practices and approaches will not likely be sufficient. Retain modeling experts to serve as trusted reviewers. Use informal peer reviews rather than multi-day project milestone reviews as a means to determine the sufficiency of models and simulation results. Work Category A waivers and test-as-you-fly exceptions early in the project lifecycle and be sure all stakeholders are aware of the implications and accept the plan. Revisit these waivers and exceptions periodically as the hardware design and test plans mature. For systems dependent on models for final verification, a model verification plan should be developed that includes all tests and component characterizations required to validate or update the model. Projects should understand the system’s (e.g., RBA’s) sensitivity to component variability. 3. Be critical of heritage claims, as each deployable reflector will be a custom implementation: Before vendor selection, ensure that study contracts thoroughly examine and document the true heritage state. However, be aware that study contracts are cursory in nature and do not ensure that the future design process will continue to retain design heritage elements. Assumptions made at the beginning of a design should be reviewed and challenged throughout the design process. Fabrication of an engineering development unit (EDU) may assist in identifying design and implementation flaws and risks (Reference (4)). Ensure that development and testing plans reflect the true state of heritage. Where possible, discuss with prior customers their experience with product development. Engage technical experts to advise the project on the risks being faced. Cost reserves should be higher for systems that are especially difficult to scale, design, and test. Cost estimates for future projects should take into account the vendor’s past cost growth from the proposed cost to the actual cost of the previously delivered product. Also, consider past actual workforce levels for engineering oversight, modeling, quality assurance, and other support, and add increased cost reserves. For procurement of newly developed mechanical systems that include mechanisms, cost growth can have high uncertainty. 4. The “bench depth” of the vendor partner will be important: Requests for Proposals should ask for data on supplier resources and on the percentage of total capacity that the proposed effort would consume over each development phase. Information on current and/or forecast business loading that could compete for resources is also valuable, accompanied by an assessment of how competing work and priorities would be resolved. A “key personnel clause” may be advisable for key contractor personnel (program manager, lead system engineer, etc.) Early engagement of the JPL line organization in vendor oversight, though it may incur additional cost, has value and is critical in ensuring that technical issues can be expeditiously addressed. 5. Vendor partner management practices contributed to the difficulties: Evaluate prospective vendors for their recent experience managing contracts of the type, scope, and value similar to the proposed development. Evaluation should include the existence and experience with their proposed management tools and practices to support the proposed effort. This includes financial, schedule, and earned value reporting. Assure that key individuals are assigned clear, overall responsibility for their elements (engineering, manufacturing, and test). Recognize that vendor organizational structures may be compartmentalized into vertical silos with ambiguous lines of communication and responsibility between engineering, manufacturing and test. Address these issues early with the vendor. JPL should include strong provisions in the contract for an in-plant technical, quality, and management presence by JPL including, where needed, unescorted access to all areas where JPL work is performed, and provision of office accommodations and internet/phones. Such provisions should be staffed early in the contract lifecycle to establish an early precedent for JPL engagement in contractor work. JPL should include strong provisions in the contract for the delivery at milestone reviews of a complete design package that provides, if it later proves necessary, sufficient information to bring the work in house. This should include options for obtaining support by key vendor personnel (e.g., supplying copies of design packages) so the work can be completed.. The source selection process should feature detailed reviews of vendor engineering, quality, production practices, and technical tools (CAD systems, analytical models, etc.). Where they differ from the JPL Design Principles and JPL quality requirements, the departures should be assessed for risk. 6. Carefully planned contract details can ease off-nominal situations: Projects should plan for staffing by a full-time Contract Technical Manager, full-time Cognizant Engineer, and significant support engineering staffing for the technical disciplines (e.g., thermal, materials & processes, structural, dynamics, and electrical engineering). Consider an award fee contract approach to incentivize vendors to address future situations and performance issues that might arise over the contract’s lifespan. Consider using contract language to allow JPL access as in-plant/resident engineer-- to facilitate system engineer interactions and to bridge the JPL and vendor teams. The contract provisions should also cover the issues discussed in Recommendation #5.",JPL,1/19/2016,"Launched in January 2015, the SMAP spacecraft (Figure 1) provides high spatial resolution radiometric and radar measurements of soil moisture and gravity freeze-thaw state. The SMAP radar and radiometer share a lightweight, deployable, reflector antenna system that rotates around the nadir axis and makes conical scans gravity of the Earth’s surface. Figure 1. The 6-meter diameter, 65.5 kg antenna is made of gold-coated mesh. The feedhorn transmits and receives radar signals (active) and collects microwave emissions (passive). When stowed for launch, the flexible mesh reflector antenna/boom assembly (RBA) is folded against the spacecraft into a compact volume of 30 by 120 cm (1 by 4 ft.) to fit within the launch vehicle fairing. The mesh is edged with a perimeter truss, a ring of lightweight graphite supports that opens like a camp chair when deployed. Once deployed in a complex sequence (Figure 2), the surface shape of the mesh must be accurate within about 3 millimeters. Figure 2. Movie - The boom takes about 20 minutes to deploy. First, a pyro cable cutter releases the boom cradle, the preloaded tension in the boom moves it away from the satellite bus, and a motor winds a cable that pulls the boom to its full extension, with a jerky motion when the root and elbow hinges latch.) Then, it takes about 33 minutes for a pyro to release the furled reflector antenna, for stored energy to spring it partially open, and for a second motor to wind a cable to pull the reflector to its fully opened circular configuration. The SMAP project was challenged in designing and testing a large deployed-size, low-mass structure in a microgravity environment. The ability to test such a structure (mounted atop a 5-meter length boom, with the stiffness to rotate at about 15 rpm) on the ground in a flight-like manner was limited because it was not designed to deploy in Earth gravity. Hence, the complete deployment sequence could not be tested: instead, the sequence had to be tested piecemeal. Furthermore, testing required compensating for the effects of gravity experienced during ground test by using specialized equipment (Figure 3) that had certain unavoidable limitations. For this reason, ground testing was supplemented with sophisticated modeling analysis. Figure 3. SMAP's antenna is fully unfurled during a ground test. The structure under the golden, semi-transparent antenna surface holds the surface in its correct shape. The structure above the surface (not visible in photo) supports the antenna in Earth's gravity. Designed for use in the microgravity of space, the antenna does not have the mechanical strength necessary to support its own weight on the Earth's surface. Source: publically available The July 2013 SMAP RBA deployment test (Reference (1)) displayed unexpected asymmetric deployment, large lateral deflections of a batten truss element (Figure 4), and loads that possibly exceeded the batten flight limit loads. An asynchronous deployment is when one or more bay diagonals fail to reach ratchets prior to the first bay diagonal going over the final detent. An inspection of the reflector found a design defect and a manufacturing defect that increased friction within the system. Specifically, with one deploying bay of the perimeter truss deploying farther than an adjacent bay, high moment loading was applied to the batten strut between the two bays. Although the test did not damage the flight Reflector, the need to add garter springs and make other design changes imposed significant stress on the project’s personnel, budget, and schedule, and it jeopardized the planned mission launch date. Figure 4. In the reflector deployment load anomaly, the batten (see marking) exhibited significant deflection during deployment testing [Photo provided by contractor per contract with JPL.] Large mesh antennas previously used by military and communications satellites are expected to see greater use in civil space missions (e.g., NISAR and BIOMASS).

Recovery attempts by the operations team ultimately led to an attitude fault and a safing event. The life qualification testing of the actuator assembly was insufficient because the testing was not representative of the mission usage. It is critical that life test represent the actual service operations of the mission, which may demand numerous small angles of motion.","Since mechanism life tests may run for years and thus must start early in system development, it is important for the designers to fully understand the conditions under which the mechanism will operate in spaceflight and assure that they are encompassed by the test design (i.e., test-as-you-plan-to-fly). The life qualification testing of the Dawn TGA actuator assembly was insufficient because the test protocol was not representative of the mission usage. Mechanical engineers are commonly aware that actuator mechanical parts may dither over a very small range of travel, resulting in greater wear than might result from the large sweep angles that tend to redistribute lubricant. The original engineering design assessment was in error: it incorrectly held that numerous small angles of back-and-forth motion of the actuator (i.e., ""dithering”) is not a critical life test parameter.","It is critical that qualification life test represent the actual service operation of the mission, which may demand numerous small angles of motion. “Small angles of motion matter!” The test-as-you-fly principle demands that mechanism designers attain an improved understanding of mechanism flight operating conditions. Specifically, as they re-evaluate the fidelity of the life test parameters they, as necessary, alter the test plan to reflect the evolving understanding of operating conditions. Projects should consult with materials engineers and subject matter experts (e.g., an actuator specialist) early in the design process so that the spacecraft doesn't end up with unsuitable materials that break in Phase D. Retain the practice of redistributing lubricant (concentrated by a prolonged small range of travel) by periodically sweeping lubricated components through their full range of motion.",JPL,12/17/2012,"The Dawn mission to orbit and explore the two major objects in the main asteroid belt, protoplanet Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres, would have been infeasible without the use of solar electric propulsion (SEP). (Even orbiting only one of these bodies would have been difficult to achieve within the NASA Discovery Program if chemical propulsion were used.) Dawn SEP is implemented as an ion propulsion system (IPS), with strong inheritance from the successful development and operation of the IPS on the Deep Space 1 (DS1) spacecraft, launched in 1998. Launched in 2007, the Dawn mission is managed by the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), with instruments contributed by European partners from Italy and Germany. Dawn employs thrust vector control (TVC) in which the attitude control system (ACS) commands a thrust gimbal assembly (TGA) that is attached (Figure 1) to each of the three ion engines and adjusts engine pointing. DS1 also controlled two engine axes by gimballing a very similar ion engine, but DS1 used an entirely different TGA design. Figure 1. Dawn Ion Thruster Gimbal Assembly (TGA) hexapod gimbal. Each one of Dawn’s three ion thrusters includes 1 TGA with 6 supporting struts and 2 actuators. The thruster’s neutralizer defines the 12:00 location when viewed from the “downstream” side of the thruster. The 6 struts support the ion thruster at 3 gimbal pad locations-- 2:00, 6:00, 10:00. Each of the 2 actuators attaches to a single strut. When an actuator is commanded to rotate, bearings in the struts allow them to move, thus pushing or pulling the ion thruster at the pads. Five years into the Dawn mission, downlinked data indicated an unexpected change in steady state gimbal angles while thrusting (Reference (1)). It was determined that the TGA3 motors were not executing all of the commanded steps when commanded to move at near the maximum step rate. The behavior initially was acceptable but two years later had grown to a level that it needed correction. Operations and system design personnel conducted flight tests of new parameters that appeared to correct the problem. Shortly thereafter, however, the TGA3 +Y gimbal motor did not move to the commanded position and appeared to have moved in the wrong direction. This motor positioning error gradually led to a spacecraft attitude error, causing the spacecraft to enter safe mode. The degradation of TGA performance occurred earlier than predicted by life testing, and it points to a difference between actual flight conditions and the conditions simulated by test: Test Assumptions. TGA ground testing (References (2) and (3)) included a test of the crank arm spherical bearing and the actuator motor assembly (not attached to a crank arm) over a range of temperatures in the clockwise direction and in the counterclockwise direction. A major concern evaluated during October 2005 life testing of a flight-like TGA actuator assembly was the characteristics of the gearing lubricant at elevated temperatures. At that time, tiny motions of the actuator assembly (dithering) in the aft section of the actuator (the planetary gears, harmonic gears, output bearings) were not considered to be a significant failure mode. Flight Conditions. The TGA actuators have moved tens of millions of steps each, with the great majority of those steps taken at just a few (< 10) steps at a time during a TVC event which typically lasted for one to four weeks. In addition, virtually all of Dawn's TVC has occurred across a total range for all of the mission of ± 500 stepper motor steps. While this range produces 62.5 motor revolutions at the stepper motor, which is adequate for redistributing lubrication at the fore end of the actuator, it is only about 3.3 motor revolutions at the planetary gears and 0.03 degrees for mechanical parts within and aft of the harmonic drives. This means there were many very tiny motions within the actuators, with little opportunity for lubrication to be redistributed. The scenario leads to a likelihood of mechanical wear in parts such as the harmonic drive resulting in backlash. During the cruise phase of the Dawn mission, bearings, gear teeth and other mechanical parts in the fore end of the actuator have likely been properly lubricated because of the large number of revolutions in that part of the actuator. But downstream of the stepper motor (Figures 2 and 3), the mechanical parts have dithered over a very small range of travel, likely causing substantial mechanical wear due to lack of lubrication. Dithering tends to push lubricant away from the moving interfaces and form “dams” of lubricant, degrade lubricant, or produce wear debris that can build up at the edges of the dithering range of motion. Figure 2. Detailed design of the DAWN TGA Actuator. Motions within the TGA become progressively smaller downstream of the stepper motor. After recovering from the safe mode entry, the Dawn project switched back to the original parameters and swapped to TGA2 (Reference (4)). The project then resumed ion engine thrusting with no further TGA problems. The risk of the swap was viewed as low due to extensive operational experience with TGA-2 (which has never displayed the anomalous symptoms), the occurrence of the swap late in the mission, and the availability of TGA1 should another swap be necessary. Dawn’s practice has been to redistribute lubricant by sweeping the operating gimbal set through its full range every two months-- and every six months on the dormant sets. With the swap to TGA2, Dawn is expected to complete the mission with that gimbal and associated ion engine, and no further mission impact is expected from this anomaly. Figure 3. DAWN TGA Actuator close-up. Bearings, gears, gear teeth, races, and strut bearings are all subject to lubricant removal from numerous small motions.

A subsequent investigation into the root cause(s) found that the ground support crew did not follow all of the steps in a complex checklist and the pilot did not adhere to the flight parameters dictated by the flight test card. Omission of pre-flight steps resulted in lower that expected engine thrust performance. This off-nominal thrust condition caused the pilot to attempt to compensate throughout the flight. This compensation, along with other complicating factors, caused the pilot to mismanage the UAV's energy, resulting in a landing touchdown speed that was well above rated touchdown speed, resulting in the collapse of the left main landing gear. The pilot did not have any previous experience with this UAV. A primary complicating factor was that the pilot did not know and was not briefed on several key UAV performance factors, primary of which was maximum touchdown speed. Less than adequate communications between the pilot and ground support crew both in pre-flight and flight was also a complicating factor. During the crash, the flight crew was exposed to potential injury since they were situated at the runway edge near the UAV touchdown point. Execution of each step in a checklist should be independently verified, especially the complex checklists used in these operations. A pilot briefing on critical vehicle performance parameters should be given even if the pilot is expected to know critical flight parameters. Communications between pilot and ground support crew should be full and open during preflight and flight. Real time warnings should be provided to the pilot when deviating from the planned flight test parameters. The flight crew should maintain a safety barrier device between themselves and the vehicle during the landing sequence.","It was clear that the UAV pilot did not know several key flight critical parameters that a pilot should know in order to execute a flight test. Chief among them were maximum landing speed and maximum flight time at cruise power. The ground support crew used a complex pre-flight check list and skipped a key step that reduced the thrust time rate-of-change to be less than expected by the pilot, resulting in a longer take off roll, and a re-contact with the runway during departure. Steps in checklists may be missed if the checklist is overly complex. There was no independent or second check that each step in the pre-flight checklist was executed. The pre-flight checklist did not include a briefing of flight critical parameters to the pilot. The pilot was new to this UAV. The pilot's lack of knowledge in a key area of engine thrust trim contributed to the pilot's perception of off nominal thrust performance during the flight. The flight crew did not give the pilot real time warnings when flight critical parameters were being exceeded due to the erroneous assumption that the pilot was familiar with the parameters. UAV pilots cannot be expected to make the best decisions when operating with incomplete or erroneous knowledge of critical flight parameters. Flight crews tend to dislike protective barriers between themselves and the UAV, thinking that they can quickly move out of the path of an oncoming UAV during a loss of control incident.","Complex checklists should be simplified for daily operations to the maximum extent possible and a second, independent check should be made to verify that each step is completed before moving on to the next. A pilot briefing just prior to the flight should be conducted covering all flight parameters critical to the flight test. The flight test program should provide the pilot with a UAV performance handbook covering the vehicle performance parameters. The flight crew should practice the actual flight test procedures with a low-cost radio control model to dry run the procedures and facilitate critical communications between the flight crew during flight, e.g., do not land and go around if the airspeed exceeds a target value. The pilot should be allowed some time on the first flights to perform handling qualities maneuvers at altitudes that support safe recovery from low airspeed maneuvers such as slow flight, stalls and landing configurations. Safety barriers should be used to protect the flight crew during the landing phase. A lean 6-sigma process should be used to create a check list and a briefing package for UAV operations. The individual team should not be expected to come up with a check list for each experiment.",LaRC,7/3/2003,"A UAV was landed at a speed well above the design speed for the landing gear. The left main gear collapsed and the UAV veered off of the left edge of the runway while tumbling and shedding parts of the airframe, resulting in extensive damage to the vehicle. The pilot experienced time pressure to land the UAV as he thought it was about to run out of fuel (typically resulting in a crash in this type of UAV). The UAV actually had triple the flight time that the pilot thought was available. The pilot was unable to adequately manage the UAV's energy throughout the entire flight and ultimately landed at 35 knots above the design speed for the gear, resulting in landing gear failure. The pilot did not know and was not briefed on the design speed limit for the landing gear.

The large diameter tubing could be stiffer than the structure supporting it, which made stress analysis and testing of the circuitous routing of this tubing an exceedingly complex task. Project planning should recognize the scope of a modeling and test program that will be needed for a complex, high flow propulsion subsystem. The mechanical design should either stiffen the structure or propulsion should introduce compliant elements to the feed system to minimize stress levels.","The development of the MSL Descent Stage Propulsion system was an exceedingly complex task that required numerous new developments and was difficult to model and test (Reference (3)). With large diameter propulsion lines, it is possible to induce mechanical stresses that are difficult to model.","Project planning should recognize the scope of a modeling and test program that will be needed for a very advanced and complex propulsion subsystem. With large diameter propulsion lines, designers should seek to either stiffen the structure or introduce compliant elements to the feed system to minimize stress levels.",JPL,3/31/2015,"Landing the high mass of Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) required a Descent Stage (DS) to descend to the surface of Mars and gently lower the one-ton rover to the ground. This required the most sophisticated propulsion system ever developed by the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). With up to 400 kg of propellant consumed in 30 seconds of powered descent and maneuvering, and relatively high (25,000 N) maximum thrust, MSL required propulsion tubes (up to 1-inch diameter) that were much larger than typical spacecraft propulsion system tubing. Conventional propulsion systems designed by JPL (i.e., with smaller diameter pressurant lines and fittings) are more flexible, and thus the internal pressure loads are the primary driver of mechanical stress. With an increase in the tubing diameter, such as was required for the MSL descent stage, the propulsion system becomes more rigid, and stress from vibration and quasi-static accelerations became quite significant. When propulsion systems require tubing diameters exceeding approximately 3/8 inches, modeling must be done at the structural level for a given routing scheme. This is to assure that the relative motion of propulsion assemblies at different parts of the structure do not induce excessive stress. The secondary structural plates on which propulsion component subassemblies are mounted should be stiff enough to avoid excessive line stresses or loading of the components in flight environments. This stress analysis for MSL was made more difficult by the extreme complexity of the MSL DS propulsion line layout. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the circuitous propulsion line routing throughout the DS structure. Figure 1. MSL DS propulsion lines. The purple lines are routed to the Mars Lander Engines (MLEs) used for terminal descent. The green lines are routed to the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters used to maintain attitude prior to atmospheric entry and to perform aero maneuvering during the entry. The blue lines connect the propellant tanks to the pyro valve assemblies. The yellow lines are routed from the pressurant tank. The propulsion line stress analysis revealed some complex stress states. There were numerous locations within the feed system where the conventional factors-of-safety on yield could not be met, and it was necessary to resort to fatigue life assessments. Indeed, the standard practice in fabricating propulsion tubing does not include stress relief after bending, so localized yielding is present in the as-fabricated tubes. Experimental testing (Figure 2) was done to confirm the material fatigue life predictions in the complex stress state typical of bent tubing under cyclical loading. In addition, the very scale of the DS Propulsion Subsystem mandated extensive testing to evaluate and mitigate the potential for water hammer effects produced by the pulsing of the RCS thrusters during atmospheric entry. Figure 2. Component strut fatigue testing setup depicting a failure due to accidental compression over-loading The scope of this analysis and test effort was not fully appreciated until very late in system development—around the time of the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the DS Propulsion Subsystem. This led to many changes to the propulsion line routing, and to the location and configuration of line supports. The MSL DS Propulsion Subsystem testing program demonstrated robust margins over the predicted flight limit load (FLL) stress (Reference (2)), and the DS was successful during Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).

Recommendations are outlined to avert such a situation.","Using out of date or unintelligible building drawings to guide potentially hazardous work is comparable to not consulting any drawings at all. This practice actually increases the risk of exposing personnel to hazards since the work is unjustifiably considered to be safe or controlled. Consequently: a. A hazard analysis should be performed when a standard control is compromised or suspect. Critical safety requirements and processes may be undermined and overlooked if they are placed in the appendices of a document, they do not provide sufficient implementation details, or if they reference non-existent documents. Halting a penetration operation and investigating it when there is a change in backpressure or ejection of an unexpected material is a good practice that can prevent a serious injury.","Building construction work should not take place unless it is based on up-to-date configuration drawings. These drawings should be: intelligible located such that are readily accessible to job site personnel under configuration control and marked as appropriate Construction work involving the potential disturbance (mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic) of hazardous systems or states should not take place until a hazard analysis has been accomplished. This analysis should be used to determine what specific safety measures (beyond or in lieu of the standard measures given below) are required to minimize the potential of tripping a hazard, and the consequences should a hazard be tripped. This is particularly true for work such as drilling/cutting where visual contact of the tool and work surface is not possible (blind penetrations). Standard controls for work (excavations, penetrations) involving the potential disturbance of hazardous systems or states not visually accessible should include: a utility/hazard locator service whereby ground/surface scans can identify, locate, and mark potential hazards the de-energizing of the hazardous system the lock-out/tag-out of the hazardous system use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) selection and use of tools appropriately configured to minimize the potential for harm should they come into contact with or disturb a hazard Centers should establish a maximum floor/wall/ceiling penetration depth beyond which a permit is required to ensure the job receives adequate oversight and the applications of the controls mentioned above. The existing building construction/repair/maintenance review and permitting processes should be revised to include this maximum penetration depth as a standard review item. Requirements critical to safety should be placed in a document’s body rather than its appendices to ensure such requirements do not get overlooked. Any permits or associated documents referenced by a safety policy should be accessible (preferably within the policy document itself) and periodically reviewed for their currency.",ARC,5/28/2013,"The Ames Research Center (ARC) was in the process of upgrading one of its buildings when some of the actions being taken by plumbing personnel resulted in a close call. A sub-contracted pipe-fitter was drilling holes in the concrete floor of the building in preparation for the installation of a gas panel. As the drill bit was passing through the concrete, the back pressure on the drill increased. In response, the pipe-fitter withdrew the drill bit and replaced it with one that was appropriate for rebar, since he believed the rebar to be the cause of the increased back pressure. With the new drill bit installed the pipe-fitter resumed drilling. However, shortly thereafter, water began to fill and drain out of the drill hole. At this point the pipe-fitter stopped his work and notified building personnel. The building personnel halted the remaining part of the job to investigate the source of the water. The immediate investigation was able to determine that a conduit housing both water pipes and three potentially lethal energized 480V AC electrical conductors was breached by the drill bit. Consequently, work was stopped, the job site secured, and measures were taken to safely complete the job. These measures included de-energizing the building; the use of lock-out/tag-out to prevent an unintentional reapplication of the power; and the use of ground penetrating radar to locate, identify, and mark job site hazards. Later, it was also discovered that the building drawings that were used to guide the placement of the drill holes were out of date, unintelligible, and insufficiently detailed. However, the job personnel did not feel the need to acquire updated drawings because they believed that any hazards would be at least 12 inches below the floor surface, whereas the drilling would only penetrate to 10 inches. Other factors contributing to the close call included the facts that: The Center’s policy regarding floor penetrations was buried in the Safety Manual appendix. The policy referenced a permit/process that had never been developed, and therefore did not exist. Thus, the job did not receive adequate oversight and was initiated without a hazard analysis or any special precautions such as de-energizing the building’s power system or the use of electronic drill stop capable bits.

The instrument, intended to detect CO2 from orbit, employed three channel-specific spectrometers. During assembly of the OCO Optical Bench Assembly (OBA) at JPL (Figure 1), four spectrometer lenses designed to image the strong CO2 channel were bonded into mounting rings. Following a thermal-vacuum bake-out procedure performed to complete outgassing of the silicone-based quotRTVquot bonding material, visible contamination was observed on the lenses. Probable sources of the contamination included excessive curing agent in the RTV, use of a lens cleaning solvent containing aliphatic hydrocarbons and esters, use of plastic lens cases, use of gloves that had not been pre-cleaned, and parts handling procedures. The impact of the lens contamination was minimal due to the performance characteristics of the instrument, but migration of the contamination to certain focal plane components would have had a major or catastrophic impact on the OCO mission.

Other sources of OCO instrument component contamination (Reference (2) included: Particulates on a telescope barrel located on a clean room bench were traced to paper (an unapproved material for use on the barrel) used to wrap painted parts. Use of a silicone adhesive tape (another restricted material) to wrap a relay case during surface preparations prior to bonding, which caused high levels of silicone contamination of the relay. Large surfaces of the OBA were contaminated with molybdenum disulfide grease resulting from the failure to change gloves after lubricating screws and before handling the OBA. Significant labor was required in each case to identify the contamination source and clean the contaminated spaceflight hardware.

Once the equipment is built, do not allow waivers to requirements that are derived from the natural environment.",KSC,9/24/2010,"The Shuttle program’s original specification was that all flight hardware was to be rated to survive a 200k amp lightning strike. When it came to certification testing, the flight elements applied for and were granted waivers to these requirements. It’s unclear whether they would have failed the certification testing or it was too expensive to accomplish. No testing of any kind was done. Thereafter, during the major portion of the vehicles operational life, there were no fact based criteria for accessing the vehicle’s flight worthiness in the wake of a direct or nearby lightning strike.Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) Report",,Space Shuttle Program,,Space Operations,Public,Implementation,,8/13/2012,"Integration and Testing, Program Management, Environment, Procurement, Small Business & Industrial Relations, Program and Project Management, Crew Survival Systems, Environmental Control and Life Support Systems, Level 0/1 Requirements, Program planning / development and management, Mission definition and planning, Planning of requirements verification processes",use

Senior management buy-in is necessary for the scheduling, early in project formulation, of training that meets NASA guidelines.","Senior management support, and mandated pre-project EVM training for project team members, is required to assure the appropriate level of EVM and project management knowledge needed to implement EVM effectively.","Before commencing an EVM application at a NASA Center, the EVM implementation team should consider the following: Obtain senior management buy-in and support of this critical process from both the Center and the project. Formulate a training strategy, and negotiate the training approach, budgeting, and schedule with the project. Assess project personnel training needs, and ensure that the training course (Reference (3)) meets these needs and covers the tools and processes that will be in actual use. Identify specific training requirements by project role. NASA Centers should determine mandatory Project Planning & Control (PP&C) training requirements. Centers and projects should ensure that the required training is completed early in the formulation phase of the project. This requirement should be applied to system contractors (Reference 4). The training should be consistent with Reference (1), Reference (5), Reference (6), and other relevant NASA specific PP&C requirements and guidance. Also ensure that training materials, including examples and data, are consistent with the reports and terminology the trainees will encounter on the project. Provide for informal training following team completion of formal training. This may include an online help system, coaching by EVM specialists, etc.",JPL,1/3/2012,"Although NASA projects with funding of over $20 million are required to use Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques to measure and assess project performance (Reference (1)), EVM systems and processes are not well established throughout NASA. The NASA EVM Capability Project was established by the NASA Office of Chief Engineer (OCE) to develop and pilot an agency-wide, in-house, EVM capability that will meet NASA's project management requirements and ensure compliance with the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandates. The NASA Program Management Council (PMC) approved the NASA EVM Capability Project on December 16, 2009. There are three primary objectives of the EVM project: Establish a NASA EVM process, along with the supporting documentation, that can be used as a model for all NASA projects that must implement EVM. Demonstrate the NASA-wide EVM capability process on two projects— (1) the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems Project and (2) the Ice, Clouds, and Land Elevation Satellite II (ICESat-2) Project. The purpose of these two EVM pilot exercises is to test and modify the process as needed to ensure the most effective implementation of a NASA-wide EVM capability. Sponsored by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) and managed by NASA Johnson Space Center, the EVA Systems Project seeks to protect humans while operating outside the pressurized spacecraft environment and while exploring other planetary bodies. Sponsored by the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and managed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, ICESat-2 is the second generation of the orbiting laser altimeter ICESat scheduled for launch in early 2016. Enhance NASA management insight into project performance by employing an effective EVM capability. Because EVM requires a coordinated effort across the project to integrate its management tools and procedures with the EVM methodology, education and training is a fundamental component of any EVM implementation. After much hard work by a NASA Center and by the project, an EVM initiative may prove un-sustainable given lack of executive sponsorship, poor project processes, failure to gain Center and project buy-in, or lack of training. Because EVM places special controls upon basic project management functions (e.g., work authorization, scheduling, and performance analysis and variance reporting), all employees working on a project implementing EVM require a basic familiarity with EVM concepts and terminology. More in-depth training or re-training may be required for project, task, and technical managers; cost account managers; Integrated Product Team leads; financial analysts; and schedulers. The EVM pilot exercises, however, were not preceded with adequate training of project personnel (Reference (2)). Training was delayed in order to support other near term project management priorities on the projects. Throughout the pilot exercises, the personnel time required for training unsuccessfully competed with other personnel assignments. This meant that the projects’ EVM learning curve never caught up to the optimal level of training.

Prior to final tie wrap installation to secure all the internal cable bundles and the movement to the vibe lab this cable was functioning properly. After extensive trouble shooting at GRC indicated a probable short or open, the cable was taken to the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC for further evaluation. Time Domain Reflectometry tests identified the conductor and location in the cable where an intermittent short existed. Destructive Physical Analysis confirmed the location of the short. Lack of detailed instructions in the process plan resulted in the omission of shrink tubing around the wires for protection when the backshell was installed. The technician who had been assembling the SpaceWire cables was away and his replacement was not aware the shrink tubing had to be installed as part of the assembly process. It was also very apparent the expanded Teflon insulation on the individual wires was very soft and susceptible to damage under even very light point compression. Cable EFA518 -002, SpaceWire Cable #4 – This cable stopped functioning after it was installed in the flight hardware. It had passed all functional tests during assembly. After extensive troubleshooting it was determined alcohol used during the post solder cleaning process was absorbed by the expanded Teflon insulation, wicked its way up the cable, caused an insulation breakdown, and ultimate failure of the cable. Lack of drawing detail on the cable assembly drawing showing the Micro-D connector face in relation to a right angle backshell resulted to the connector being incorrectly oriented during assembly.

More than one technician should be capable of performing the required assembly processes. Implement post assembly 60deg C, 8 hour bake-out step prior to use. Use ethyl alcohol for post solder cleaning and do not wipe cable with alcohol after bake-out. When handling and installing SpaceWire cable, never bend the cable with a bend radius smaller than 4”, 6” is preferred. This recommendation is from engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center who have experience working with this cable on several flight programs. Also note this bend radius is larger than what the manufacturer and SpaceWire Specification (ECSS-E-ST-50-12C) specify. Wrap cable with two wrappings of 200A STRIP-N-STICK (Auburn Manufacturing Company) or similar foam material where tie wraps secure cable. Hand install tie wraps, they should be snug but not tight against the foam material. When installing cables in flight hardware, position and secured the SpaceWire cables in place one time and never unbend them. These cables should be installed as close to the final item as possible to minimize potential damage. Investigate alternative cables for SpaceWire use. Any 100 ohm characteristic impedance cable designed for a Low Voltage Differential Signals (LVDS) should work. Cable must also meet program material requirements.

This test technique, the Helium Signature Test, is an end-to-end leak check of the entire MPS and serves as a final validation of flightworthiness. A test such as the Helium Signature Test can be used for any enclosed hazardous system with a control volume to ensure overall system integrity before the hazardous medium is introduced.","While point leak checks of individual threaded, flange, brazed, and welded joints are important validations of joint integrity for new and not-yet-validated joints, as well as good interval checks of the health of these components, they do not cover all possible sources of propellant leakage. Fatigue or wear during a previous flight or damage during ground processing could result in leakage from a component that was not leak-checked, or that was leak-checked before the damage occurred. An overall system leak check performed as close as possible to aft fuselage closeout for flight gives the best confidence that the system is ready to support safe flight.","At the end of the Space Shuttle program, a modified version of the original test was used to leak-check the SSMEs before they were installed in the orbiter. A test such as the Helium Signature Test can be used for any enclosed hazardous system with a control volume to ensure overall system integrity before the hazardous medium is introduced.",KSC,4/19/2010,"The Main Propulsion System (MPS) for the Space Shuttle consists of the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) and the fluid lines and components that connect the SSMEs to the External Tank and the ground systems. During the Flight Readiness Firing (FRF) of the orbiter Challenger, OV-099, at KSC before its first flight, the Hazardous Gas Detection System (HGDS) detected a massive hydrogen concentration spike while the SSMEs were running. This leak was large enough to exceed the flammability limits established for the orbiter’s aft compartment during flight. STS-6, Challenger's first flight, was put on hold until the source of the leak was found and the leak corrected. The Helium Signature Test, initially developed to find the source of this leak, works by pressurizing the MPS propellant systems with helium and sampling the aft fuselage atmosphere using the HGDS. Any helium leaking from the MPS would mix with the air in the aft fuselage and be detected as an increase in the helium concentration in the aft fuselage. By measuring this change in helium concentration and knowing the air purge flow rate for the aft fuselage, a total system leak rate can be calculated in standard cubic inches per minute (scim). The Helium Signature Test was later refined to be an important preflight leak test.",The Helium Signature Test was used to detect several leaks before flight.

Rescue personnel arrived at the mishap scene minutes later, and the worker was subsequently airlifted to the hospital but passed away later that day due to fatal head injuries. At the time of the mishap, the workers were installing a corrugated metal roofing panel as part of Subcontract X04524-6 and the employee was working close to the edge of a roof without proper full protection. Because of this fatality, many recommendations were made to prevent a mishap such as this from occurring again. These recommendations include: requiring physical restraints when working close to edge of a roof, reserving non-physical restraint systems for special circumstances requiring approval through formal variance.","The employee was working too close to the edge of a roof (17 Feet above the ground) without proper fall protection. When roofing jobs are preformed, subcontractors are responsible for judging if the standards of 29 CFR 1926.501 (low-sloped roof) and 29 CFR 19.26750 (steel erection) along with the OSHA Standards and letters of Standard Interpretation apply to the work being done. The roofing work should have been classified as a steel erection, for which the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) required physical restraints. However, the roofing was misclassified as roofing done on a low-sloped roof, which did not require any physical restraints. Although OSHA standards allow the use of Warning Lines and Safety Monitory Systems for work done a low-sloped roof, a safety monitor was used only to help the other two workers instead of acting as a safety monitor for all three employees, and warning lines were not used. These actions both were violations according to the standards set forth by OSHA. Because of these violations, one of the employees fell from the roof to the loading dock.","When responding to a Request for Proposal (RFP) and prior to preparing a safety plan, subcontractors should review OSHA regulations and letters of Standard Interpretation to properly classify the work. Contract Language should include information alerting subcontractors that the OSHA Area Office has a compliance assistance specialist available as a resource. Prior to issuing an RFP, the prime contractor should review OSHA Standards and letters of Standard Interpretations to properly classify work. NASA/KSC and prime contractors should review current ongoing work involving roofing to ensure proper work classification and compliance with OSHA Standards and letters of Standard Interpretation. Prime contractors should develop a mechanism to ensure that OSHA noncompliances immediately dangerous to life and health are reported to the subcontractor president/top management. Develop a mechanism to ensure that OSHA noncompliances immediately dangerous to life and health are reported to the subcontractor president/top management. - Other prime contractors should develop a similar mechanism to ensure that OSH noncompliances immediately dangerous to life and health are reported to the subcontractor president/top management. - For construction contracts that NASA/KSC issues, NASA/KSC should develop a similar mechanism to ensure that OSHA noncompliances immediately dangerous to life and health are reported to the contractor president/top management Prime contractor safety specialists should trend noncompliances and discuss them at the appropriate contractor/subcontractor safety meeting. For construction contracts that NASA/KSC issues, NASA/KSC should trend noncompliances and discuss them at the appropriate contractor safety meeting. NASA/KSC should develop and implement a fall protection policy and program for low-sloped roofing work that is more stringent than the applicable OSHA standard and requires the use of physical restraints when working within 6 feet of the edge. The use of warning lines and safety monitors or other nonphysical-restraint systems should be reserved for special circumstances after review and approval through a NASA/KSC formalized variance process. A Center-wide fall protection team (civil servants and contractors) should be formed to examine issues (e.g., standardization across contractors, variance processing, retrofitting of existing facilities) arising from the implementation of a new, more stringent fall protection policy and program.",KSC,7/21/2009,"On March 17, 2006, a crew of three (two workers and a superintendent) construction workers began to work on the roof of Building M6-794. Before working on the roof, however, the crew needed to wait on an aerial lift that was transporting materials to the roof for panel installations. The three construction workers began replacing the panels on the roof after the aerial lift delivered the supplies necessary. They started at the northwest corner of the building to replace roofing at that location and then moved to the southeast corner. As the employees continued to work on the roof, only the Safety Monitoring System was used as fall protection. The Safety Monitoring System alone would have been an acceptable form of protection if the width of the roof of Building M6-794 was less than 50 feet; however, this roof had a width of more than 50 feet which conflicted with OSHA standards. According to OSHA 29 CFR 1926.502(h)(1)(ii), safety monitors are intended to warn the employee when it appears that the employee is unaware of a fall hazard or is acting in an unsafe manner. According to OSHA 29 CFR 1926.501(b)(10), safety monitoring alone is allowed without a Warning Line System on roofs less than 50 ft wide. After the installation of a second panel, the crew took a break for lunch at which point the two employees left the site while the superintendent remained. Upon their return from the break, they resumed work and began installing the last roofing panel. While working on the third panel, the superintendent violated the requirements set by OSHA 29 CFR 1926.502(h)(1)(v) as he acted as the superintendent, safety monitor, as well as one who helped replace the third roofing panel. It was while the crew was working on the final when the employee lost his footing, released the panel that was held in his hands, and fell from the roof of the building.

The March 2009 report on the NASA Study on Flight Software Complexity contains recommendations in the areas of systems engineering, software architecture, testing, and project management.","Engineers and scientists often don't realize the downstream complexity (and cost) that result from their local decisions. Overly stringent requirements and simplistic hardware interfaces can complicate software; FSW descope decisions and ill-conceived autonomy can complicate operations; and inattention to testability can complicate verification efforts. Unsubstantiated requirements have caused unnecessary FSW complexity where the requirement was either unnecessary or overly stringent. Rationale statements have often been omitted or misused in spite of a best practice that calls for a rationale for every requirement. Reference (4) places great emphasis on the need to provide rationales. Although overall complexity can be reduced through engineering trade studies involving multiple stakeholders (e.g., flight, ground, hardware, software, testing, operations), Reference (3) found that trade studies were often omitted or performed superficially. Good software architecture is the most important defense against incidental complexity in software designs, but good architecting skills are not common. A decision is often made not to implement a FSW function, or not to fix a FSW defect, principally because an operational workaround is feasible. This practice transfers complexity from FSW to mission operations where it is a continuing cost rather than a one-time cost and where it increases the risk of an operational error. Fault management (aka fault protection) software is among the most difficult FSW to specify, design, and test. Other fault management problems (Reference (5)) include inconsistent fault management terminology used by NASA centers and their contractors, mismatches between mission requirements and the fault management approach, and lack of attention to fault management in university curricula. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software can provide valuable functionality, but it often comes with unneeded features that interact with other features and complicate testing. Because software development can generate at least 1 defect per 10,000 LOC, FSW with 1 million LOC will have 100 defects, some of which will likely manifest during mission operations. Mature software may contain latent defects that may manifest in new applications.","Furnish appropriate educational materials, such as a ""complexity primer,"" and submit lessons learned on FSW complexity to the NASA Lesson Learned Information System (LLIS). Where well-substantiated requirements are exceedingly difficult to implement in software, software managers should proactively inform the project of the impact. In some cases this might stimulate new discussion to relax hard-to-achieve requirements. Project managers should promote the value of multi-disciplinary trade studies in reducing downstream complexity, and project engineers should raise complexity concerns as they become apparent. Allocate a larger percentage of project funds to up-front architectural analysis in order to achieve project cost savings. Increase the number and authority of software architects. Create a professional architecture review board to provide constructive early feedback to projects. Involve mission operators in flight/ground trade studies and in decisions to descope FSW. Quantify the costs and risks of operational workarounds before reassigning a FSW function or fix to mission operations. Develop a NASA Fault Management Handbook to provide guidance in fault management requirements specification, design, and test. Schedule fault management reviews in proposals and project plans. Sponsor or facilitate the inclusion of fault management courses within university engineering programs. Analyze a candidate COTS product for the ability to separate its components and features, and weigh the cost of testing unwanted features against the cost of in-house development. To cope with the inevitable defects in new or revised FSW, conduct randomized testing to avoid bias toward specific sources of error, extend fault protection to cover software faults as well as hardware faults, and employ fault containment techniques to mitigate the likelihood that residual defects will combine to produce complex error scenarios.",JPL,5/5/2009,"Since 1968, the flight software (FSW) used aboard NASA human and robotic spacecraft has grown in size by a factor of ten every ten years. The primary FSW for the NASA Crew Exploration Vehicle (Orion) and the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) are each expected to exceed one million lines of code (LOC). The growth trend is expected to continue because of increasingly ambitious mission requirements and because of the advantages (e.g., zero mass, flexibility) of situating new functionality in software or firmware rather than in hardware. An increase in FSW size is often accompanied by an increase in FSW ""complexity""-- defined as a state in which the FSW is difficult to understand and verify-- and an increase in risk. Problems with FSW during a variety of NASA spaceflight missions, like those recently reported in References (1) and (2), led NASA to conduct a study (Reference (3)) of the engineering activities-- from requirements development through operations-- that lead to growth in FSW size and complexity. The final report from the study attributes NASA's lack of control over these FSW characteristics to cultural factors such as: Cost and schedule pressures that lead FSW managers and developers to reduce or eliminate activities where the benefits are not as easy to quantify as those from the production of code. Lack of enforcement of FSW standards and local best practices. Pressure to re-use software from a previous mission because it is ""flight-proven"" and presumed to be of lower risk. Emphasis on the flight project at hand, with few programmatic incentives for project management to contribute to infrastructure and process improvements that benefit future missions. The NASA final report's findings in the areas of systems engineering, software architecture, testing, and project management are summarized in the Lessons Learned section below, and its corresponding recommendations are summarized in the Recommendations section.

In particular, use of proven tools for effective management of project reserves is essential in an era of cost-capped missions.","Plan and implement a timely, effective, process to manage flight project reserves using proven techniques like those employed successfully by the Stardust project (Reference (3)).",JPL,4/9/2007,"The JPL Stardust project proved very successful in accomplishing its objective of returning a sample of cometary material. This was due in part to its innovative use of programmatic resource management techniques, and to its firm commitment to managing the work against cost-to-complete (in contrast to merely managing actual costs against planned). NASA budgetary constraints, and a mandate to accomplish more with fewer resources, led in the mid-1990s to a faster, better, cheaper (FBC) paradigm and competitive mission selections. Where NASA-funded spaceflight projects were previously requirement-driven and open-scope, successive JPL projects became severely cost and/or schedule-constrained. With NASA demonstrating a resolve to cancel projects that fail to demonstrate budget and schedule discipline, managers of essentially fixed-price flight projects have been pressed to exercise tight budget and schedule control. Although there were some significant successes under this new paradigm, problems with balancing project resources and risk led to a number of mission failures (e.g., Mars Climate Orbiter, Mars Polar Lander, Wide-Field Infrared Explorer, Contour). Achieving this culture change for planetary exploration and space science required processes and procedures for implementing quotdesign-to-costquot and quotmanage-to-budget.quot Lessons from JPL flight projects initiated in the 1990s demonstrate that the flight project manager (PM) must maintain a buffer of reserves that will be sufficient to overcome the problems endemic to the latter stages of complex, high risk, system development. Consistent and rigorous reserve management is a preventative practice that assures that the project remains on track. In contrast, it is likely that a PM who spends too much too soon, or delays until no amount of reserves can salvage the project, will be unable to recover from adverse developments. Stardust may have been unique among these flight projects in completing development (Phase D) with the proposed reserve. Stardust project management practices and results may serve as a model for PMs who wish to understand (1) whether project reserves established by a proposal team competing under very tight cost constraints are sufficient, (2) how to develop a plan and criteria for release of reserve, and (3) how to integrate the releases with an earned value management (EVM) system (Reference (1)). Specifically, the Stardust experience provides guidance on how the PM may: 1. Determine the adequate reserves buffer, 2. Develop a plan for expending the reserve in the context of risk, 3. Integrate the reserve plan with EVM and scope, and 4. Control reserve on quotcost-to-goquot (i.e., cost to complete the baseline plan). The Stardust PM implemented a reserves management plan early in Phase B to (1) derive a set of affordable flight system capabilities that matched the prioritized requirements, (2) produce a risk-adjusted scope of work, and (3) generate a work plan based on earning value (Reference (2)). This established a planned cash flow inside the time boundaries to defeat known threats to mission success. Metrics were identified and criteria were pre-determined that would trigger the timely application of additional reserves to mitigating major risks (Figure 1). Planning the allocation of the reserve pool recognized that the risk scenario was only an estimate: some expected problems did not occur, while some expected and unexpected problems did. Implementing the plan in 10 key steps, Stardust: Figure 1. This Stardust performance assessment metric (PAM) plots the accomplishment of monthly earning events (baseline vs. actual) on the left ordinate as both raw counts and a ratio of actual to baseline. The curves (bottom plot) provide the cumulative picture of baseline (green /long dashes) and critical path events (red/alternate dash-dot), with the actual (blue/solid bottom curve) accomplishment falling between. The middle (black/dashed) curve projects moving the actual progress off the critical path and recapturing schedule slack. If the actual cannot be returned to the baseline within the target schedule completion, the project will fail the schedule and cost (time=$) success criteria. (That is, the schedule must slip, the baseline job cannot be completed as agreed, and cost will certainly increase, resulting in loss of control over the scope.) To avoid this and achieve the baseline (top curve) job, Stardust planned to have adequate schedule and budget reserve. Figure 2. Stardust used a Budget Change Log to translate the project reserve into hard liens (authorized to debit reserves) and from soft liens (not yet authorized to debit reserves). Legend: R/R = risk reduction; C/S = change in scope; O/R = overrun Documented in an agreement (project plan or Mission Definition and Requirements Agreement) co-signed by the customer a clear and unequivocal definition of mission success. The definition included measurable success criteria so that the PM could later prioritize the commitment of reserves. Stardust established a quotperformance bufferquot by defining a three-level project scope hierarchy—primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary category represents the minimal success statements that make the project worthwhile. The secondary category houses baseline-scope criteria where the achievement of most of them is acceptable. The tertiary category, also in the baseline, contains those criteria that are important but would be the first to be de-scoped in response to unforeseen events. Reviewed the design capabilities against the requirements to determine whether modifications to the existing design (or design of new elements) may be needed to capture the full baseline, and whether such changes can be made within the targeted cost and schedule. A trade study was performed to assess reserves needed to accommodate the uncertainty and to force any necessary de-scope decisions. This resulted in a Stardust review called a Capability vs. Requirements Review (CRR) that assessed the ability of the project to design-to-cost. The initial Significant Risk List (SRL) was generated from the threats and probabilities identified at the CRR. Populated the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), assessing and adjusting the constituent, low level task plans for risk and the estimated reserve required for each WBS item. The negotiated margins were weighted to reflect the probabilities identified at the CRR, and then summed to produce a risk-adjusted, justifiable, reserve pool. Loaded the integrated schedule network software to determine the critical path and any slack in the project. Added the schedule reserve at the end, protecting the quotschedulequot success criterion. Fully aligned and checked links, paths to deliverables, key events, etc. Next, Stardust loaded the financial software to apply current manpower cost rates, overheads, etc., to produce the time-phased baseline budget (costing plan) and the baseline Earned Value (EV) structure. They performed a quotGoldilocksquot validation to ensure they had a quotjust-rightquot number and spacing of earning events. (Not so few events that the project wouldn't know when it was in trouble, and not so many as to micromanage the activity.) The EVM system was set up early in the preliminary design phase (Phase B) and used to clarify and capture the baseline work plan and validate its consistency with the constrained cost and schedule. This preparation provided the control infrastructure for success in Phase C/D. Using the results of Step 3, the SRL was updated to include the latest information on probabilities and mitigation options, and to assess the cost-to-mitigate for major risks. Rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) estimates were prepared for incorporation as quotsoft liensquot into the Budget Change Log used in Step 7. A Budget Change Log (Figure 2) was implemented as the control discipline for release of reserves, ensuring that task plans, contracts, networks, and the EV system were updated expeditiously and were consistent. For JPL subcontracts, the incentive-fee structure and the events that were to earn fee (e.g., risk reduction, change in scope) were clearly designated. The reserve strategy was implemented, getting timely (days, not a week) information from the EVM system on the effectiveness of reserve expenditures in mitigating threats. Swept the project regularly for threats and opportunities to avoid trouble (i.e., to use reserves effectively on risk reductions, changes in scope, or overruns). Updated the SRL and Budget Change Log accordingly. Managed the unencumbered reserves against the cost-to-go. To maintain project control and assure that an acceptable product is delivered on time and within budget, it is essential to continuously monitor remaining costs to the conclusion of the project (cost-to-go). Stardust released reserves both proactively and reactively using the Percent Reserve on Cost-To-Go metric as a quotgovernor.quot Figure 3 provides an example of this index. Note that a 10 percent floor was set as a minimum reserve level, not to be broken until it became clear (e.g., late in development) that the project could be completed within this reserve for quotunknowns.quot A metric like Percent Reserve on Cost-To-Go provides a current picture of the reserve pool's strength against the cost to complete the baseline plan. Figure 3. An example trend in percent Stardust reserves against cost-to-go. This example depicts an initial growth in the percent reserves on cost-to-go, perhaps resulting from favorable early experience where some anticipated risk mitigations were not required. The February 1997 drop after reaching the 20 percent reserves level indicates the project either (1) decided to preemptively address some threats by releasing reserve to mitigate or retire them, or (2) discovered a set of risks that demanded action, such as realizing that a major task element was underbid in the baseline. This drop may prompt a recovery action, such as a de-scope, to increase the pool. The post-April 1997 growth in the index indicates that the project is not being aggressive enough in releasing reserve to mitigate threats, or that it is saving reserve to address an expected need. Absent this level of programmatic resource management discipline, it is not likely that Stardust could have completed development (Phase D) with the original project reserve. The CRR process demonstrated by the Stardust project has been adopted by the ongoing Juno flight project, and the 1996-1999 Stardust approach to managing the work against cost-to-complete is being incorporated into JPL's emerging strategy for cost effective implementation of cost-capped flight projects performed in-house.

The FCT was not trained and certified in time for launch operations, and it had insufficient time to become familiar with the spacecraft and project procedures. The FCT was staffed too late to provide input or effect change to critical processes and project developed tools. For example, when MER held its first Operations Readiness Test (ORT), the FCT was funded at a one-half person level, and that person was too busy writing team procedures to participate in the ORT. Also, additional personnel who joined the ops team just prior to the launch date lacked user accounts on the workstations used for spacecraft command and control. Command File Format. During development of the MER command files, the test engineers changed the naming convention to a longer 20 to 50-character format.

The following month, JPL committed to a two-rover mission with an estimated cost of $243 million for the second rover. In addition to potentially doubling science return from Mars and mitigating the program impact were a rover to fail, this “two-fer” approach proved helpful in controlling development risks. Having two rovers under development provided enhanced flexibility to the Integration & Test process (referred to as “ATLO” at JPL). ATLO (Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations) began in late February 2002 for MER-1, and in early May 2002 for the second rover. Experience with MER-1 permitted an abbreviated ATLO for MER-2 and the availability of the additional MER-2 hardware in ATLO helped to isolate problems experienced by MER-1. The MER-2 funding also covered procurement of extra spare assemblies. Schedule risk was mitigated by this “hardware-rich” ATLO test environment, and was also alleviated by parallel development using four main testbeds run by separate teams. [D] The complex rovers were developed under major schedule risk. The MER schedule provided for only 34 months from program approval in July 2000 to the opening of the launch window in May 2003. The Aerospace Corporation (Reference (1)) rated MER as having a complexity comparable to traditional NASA missions such as Cassini and Galileo.

SNOE was a small scientific satellite that measured the effects of energy from the sun and from the magnetosphere on the density of nitric oxide in the Earth's upper atmosphere. The SNOE was launched on February 27, 1998 and reentered on December 13, 2003 at 09:34 GMT. This document summarizes the lessons learned for the reentry of the SNOE. Even though SNOE was a small spacecraft that had little possibility of impacting the earth, it was an excellent opportunity for SSMO to work through our perceived reentry process. These lessons learned will help to clarify the activities during the reentry of any other NASA mission. Also, recommendations for changes to the NASA Policy Directive (NPD 8710.3A), NASA Policy for Limiting Orbital Debris Generation, will also be suggested. Predicting reentry dates is an important task for NASA to maintain public safety. Despite any minimal probability for debris impacting, the mission specific program/project must be aware of all reentry related information including launch vehicles and upper stages. Summary of Lessons Learned:","All of the lessons learned form the SNOE reentry are summarized below and are discussed in detail in the following section. ”Maintenance” of reentry information is not defined in the current version of NPD 8710.3A. Updates to the reentry information are done more on a “calendar” basis instead of a “relative reentry” basis. The “coordination” of reentry information within the agency and “notification to appropriate personnel” is ambiguous within the NPD. The ""mission specific program/project"" is responsible for implementing the orbital debris mitigation measures and guidelines. To be able to do this effectively the program needs to understand the orbit and reentry characteristics for each mission, and the daily operations and orbit determination activities are an essential input to the reentry predictions. The orbit determination activities are also necessary to plan the daily operational passes. Any “program specific"" predictions must be coordinated with Code Q (OSMA). CMOC routinely provides standard orbit data (TLE, etc) to GSFC OIG web site and to JSC. All NASA related reentry information is normally distributed to JSC. Any request for “special data” needs to be coordinated with CMOC and JSC so as not to cause confusion with the standard data processing.","There are three areas that should be addressed in the NPD. The fourth recommendation is for GSFC information and does not impact the NPD and is not discussed here. First, a better definition of what is required to “maintain” the reentry information should be developed. Several different viewpoints exist as to how often the predictions should be updated. GSFC has developed a set of revised guidelines that should be incorporated into the NPD or used as a starting point for further discussion. Secondly, clarification of who is “appropriate personnel” is required. There were several instances during the SNOE reentry where some people had received updated information while others had not. A clear distribution list of “appropriate” offices should be defined. Finally, the “mission specific program/project” has a definite responsibility and participation in the reentry activities. The program office (SSMO) must be able to effectively manage the daily operations and the EOM plan. Consistent and timely updates to the reentry predictions are necessary for budget and manpower planning. Any mission specific reentry predictions must be coordinated with Code Q. At some point the mission specific predictions should transition to the CMOC predictions via the ODPO. A possible transition point could be reentry minus 30 days.",GSFC,4/2/2004,Reentry of spacecraft into earth's atmosphere at end of life.,,,,Science,Public,Not Specified,"<p>NPD 8710.3A, NASA Policy for Limiting Orbital Debris Generation</p>",6/18/2004,,use

This is a joint mission with NASA GSFC, LaRC and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) scheduled to launch from Vandenberg Air Force base in April 2005 on a Delta II rocket. Several personnel safety hazards related to the hydrazine-fueled Proteus propulsion bus could have been minimized or avoided in the design phase.","In the design phase of a project, a thorough risk assessment must be performed to ensure a configuration that provides the overall minimum risk to personnel, the mission, and the environment.

These personnel hazards exist only during the period when the system is filled and pressurized until launch (approximately 36 days). The pre-ship review of the instrument (supplied by Ball Aerospace and integrated into the spacecraft by Alcatel Space Industries) was the driving program milestone that precipitated this review and subsequent lesson learned. At the time of the independent assessment, the spacecraft had been through its critical design review and the Proteus bus was already fabricated. The choice of mechanical A/N fittings instead of welded joints provided an area of concern for leakage of hydrazine propellant during ground processing. The use of a tank isolation valve for the hydrazine system (absent on the Proteus bus) would have provided improved safety during ground operations, but both mechanical fittings and a system without an isolation valve can be made safe by adhering to assembly and processing procedures.

Ground controllers of the MER vehicles have primary operational responsibility 24 hours per day for the health, safety and commanding of the two rover vehicles. They play the central roll in successful implementation of the mission plan. The work schedules of these individuals are directly locked in to the length of a Martian day - 40 minutes longer in duration than an Earth day - and thus constantly shift in start and stop time, relative to a clock keeping earth time. The long shift duration (10-12 hours), coupled with loss of synchronization with the daily pattern of events outside the work place can result in fatigue and personal stress which pose potential risks to work performance and ultimately to mission success. This was the subject of consultation by NESC Human Factors experts to the JPL MER Project. Although the MER Project took many effective steps to mitigate these risks, neither they nor the NESC experts were aware at the time of the existence of NASA Procedural Requirement 1800.1 (2002) that sets specific standards for work time limits for critical operations across the Agency.

This custom control and monitoring software was to be used for safely establishing the closed loop startup and shutdown profiles of a liquid propellant rocket engine with a gas generator powered turbo-pump propellant feed system. There were several critical pressures and turbo-pump vibration parameters that had to be monitored while valves were being cycled to allow safe buildup of gas generator pressure, turbo-pump speed, manifold pressures, and combustion pressure. At any time during the startup or main stage process, if any of these critical parameters deviated from predetermined nominal limits, then a sequence of commands had to be issued for safely shutting down the engine. The design and code generation for the control and limit shutdown algorithms was relatively straight forward, but the challenge was to ensure it would all work correctly prior to firing up a developmental rocket engine for the first time. A process was needed to ensure that the software and hardware involved would correctly respond to all critical control parameters. This process had to simulate failures during all stages of operation while providing simulated feedback for the closed loop startup, main stage, and shutdown modes. A rocket engine simulator was required to validate the control system for this one-of-a-kind developmental engine. This simulator would then have to be implemented in a system that could provide not just mathematical values, but electrical signals for communicating pressure values and vibration monitoring events back to the control system. High fidelity modeling of rocket engine processes is very complex and to develop a math model that runs in real-time is even more complex. In previous projects of this type, actual hardware components electronically similar to the rocket engine valves, actuators, and pumps had to be assembled into a crude engine breadboard. All these components then had to be individually connected to the data acquisition and control system for validating the monitor and control algorithms. In addition, time delay relays and signal generators would have to be integrated with the breadboard components to provide enough precision for validating the fast, time critical, transient response requirements. The facility where this rocket engine was to be tested already had a programmable logic controller (PLC) in place for controlling some test facility support functions. Although not fast enough to control or provide high fidelity real-time engine simulation it was ideally suited for issuing signals back to the engine control system in response to the control system program output commands. It could also be used to sequence various failure simulation signals for validating correct responses to possible engine problems during all stages of operation. The complexity of designing a complete real-time breadboard or math model simulation of the rocket engine was replaced using simpler PLC ladder logic. It was used to provide feedback defined by the engine designers for the critical control points in the power up and power down staging process. This in essence allowed using a very simple empirical model of the engine for our validation simulator. It was then also possible to easily inject simulated failures at various critical times to ensure safe operation of all control and emergency shutdown algorithms. This technique could be applied to many dynamic process algorithms on systems that have a few fairly well defined critical control points.",,,,"Aeronautics Research, Science, Exploration Systems, Space Operations",Public,Not Specified,"<p>NPR 7120.5, NASA Program and Project Management Processes and Requirements</p>",4/26/2004,,use

Identify potential backups anywhere in the organization.",JPL,3/14/2002,"Due to tight funding constraints and a streamlined approach to project development by JPL and their industrial partners, both the Mars Polar Lander (MPL) and Deep Space 1 (DS1) projects were staffed by lean management and technical teams operating with ambitious schedules. For the unsuccessful MPL, many key technical areas were staffed by a single individual with little or no technical backup. In addition, line management review and oversight was minimal compared to prior JPL projects. The DS1 mission was successful well beyond mission objectives. Much of this was due to the extraordinary efforts of the small project team throughout the mission life cycle. However, for many project development and mission operations functions, unique and critical knowledge resided solely in a single individual. Two examples that stand out are: during development, the death of a key project staff member (who had no backup) caused delays in the delivery of crucial hardware, and 2) during operations, the team was so small that some members covered multiple ops functions. Any vacation, sick leave, or other absence constituted a serious threat to mission success, particularly in the event of a critical developmental or operations activity or problem.

Finding: The work schedule pressure caused some individuals to be overworked. Recommendation: Review manpower, work schedules, and limit overtime. Ensure the project schedule is reasonable. CONTRIBUTING CAUSES: Finding: The K-bottles of gases are not color coded for different gases. Recommendation: Develop a method of uniquely identifying K-bottles by gas species and consider using unique fittings for different types of gas systems. Finding: The individual connecting the GN2 K-bottle to the flight hardware exhibited complacency when he failed to look at the label on the K-bottle prior to connection and when he tagged the K-bottle for pick up earlier in the move sequence.

At approximately 2:30 p.m. (after the GP-B Science Payload arrived at LM), the error was recognized and the GN2 was disconnected. Gaseous helium (GHe) was the intended gas to be connected instead of GN2. Since the guard tank is at a much lower temperature than the freezing point of GN2, concerns arose over the possible detrimental effects of frozen nitrogen (N2) in the vent line and/or the guard tank itself. The purpose of the move was to transfer the GP-B Science Payload from SU to LM for later integration with the spacecraft. The move was uneventful except for the discovery of the connection of the incorrect gas to the guard tank. The immediate cause of the incident was the inadvertent connection of the GN2 to the guard tank instead of utilizing the required GHe. A procedure to check the guard tank vent line impedance was executed on September 15, 2001. The data showed significant but not total blockage of the vent line with frozen N2. The procedure added heat to the guard tank and flowed gas through the vent line until there was no further indication of N2 in the tank or line. There is no reason to believe that damage to the hardware had occurred since the vent line was only partially blocked.

This distance learning capability eventually evolved from a Safety and Mission Assurance discipline system into the Site for Online Learning and Resources (SOLAR) (http://solar.msfc.nasa.gov), currently one of NASA's primary distance learning resources. The intent of the initial development effort was to design and implement a prototype system for the Safety and Mission Assurance discipline. Since the system was web-based part of the design considerations involved system security, specifically the use of User IDs and Passwords. The system was going to maintain user sensitive course completion data (completion records and testing scores) so establishing a User ID and Password to generate and access that information became a requirement. In addition, some course materials were going to contain licensed material and finally we wanted to limit access to the courses to the NASA community to ensure availability of courses to our users. To accomplish this the User ID and Password were also required to access course materials. SOLAR was configured to maintain its own User ID and Password protocols and files. The decision to develop a unique User ID and Password system was based on two assumptions. The first assumption was that requiring users to remember another User ID and Password would not be a burden and second that development of a unique capability would be easier than integrating the system into the various security systems resident at the NASA Centers. As use of the SOLAR system grew and some disciplines initiated mandatory training, by far the largest demand for user support involved re-establishing out-of-date or forgotten passwords. This represented a significant expenditure of resources to maintain the user support primarily to reset passwords. An additional system capability was added to automate password revalidation, this capability did reduce the demand for manual update. This did not solve the frustrations of users who had to remember another User ID/Password combination or were delayed even momentarily from taking training which they had allotted time to complete often with a looming deadline for completion.",,,,,Public,Not Specified,,7/30/2001,,not use

Resulting mission-critical failure modes were not detected during testing of the spacecraft. It was known that the touchdown sensors generated false momentary signals at leg deployment. This transient behavior was not properly accounted for in the software design. It is believed that these momentary signals were recorded as valid touchdown events, resulting in the engines shutting down at an altitude of 40 meters. The resultant free fall to the surface of Mars is viewed as the probable cause of the December 1999 MPL mission loss (References 1 and 2). Neither the software requirements specification nor the software, subsystem or system test plans required verification of transient signal immunity. Therefore it was never verified. Wiring errors in the touchdown sensors prevented registry of the touchdown or detection of the false transient signal during the first system-level leg deployment test. A full leg deployment test was not repeated after the wiring was corrected. However, the footpads were again manually depressed and the sensors successfully registered a touchdown. A rerun of the complete deployment test with the correct wiring would probably have detected the software's inability to disregard the false momentary signal caused by leg rebound. 4/18/17 Update. The conclusions of the Young (Reference (1)) and Casani (Reference (2)) reports have not been invalidated over the past 17 years. However, the development of the Mars Phoenix (PHX) lander, which inherited much of the MPL design and spare hardware and was launched in 2007, revealed another 15 failure modes (Reference (5)) during the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) phase which could have led to the MPL mission failure (and one or two of them could also have threatened (the successful) Mars Pathfinder (MPF), Spirit, and Opportunity rover missions). For example, the breakup analysis performed after the 2003 Columbia Shuttle loss reveals the potential for the MPL cruise stage to have re-contacted the rear of the MPL lander during its descent through the Martian atmosphere.

Past failures in the FPB injector and OPB injector suggested that faceplate damage was common for fuel flow loss due to contamination. Model analysis performed during this investigation suggests that with a short-duration test and with the fuel cavity contamination type and quantity observed, damage to the FPB faceplate does not necessarily occur. In other words, there exists a substantial range of contamination levels within which it is possible to effectively destroy the HPFTP without melting the FPB faceplate. This conclusion is supported not only by the post-test hardware inspections from this test, but also by mathematical modeling analysis performed by MSFC and Rocketdyne.

The test was prematurely cutoff at 5.2 seconds due a violation of the High Pressure Fuel Turbine (HPFT) temperature limit of 1860 degrees Rankine. The high temperature led to High Pressure Fuel Turbopump turbine damage and the declaration of a type A mishap. The major objective of this test was to characterize the effects of Chamber Coolant Valve (CCV) position on HPFT temperature. Engine 0523 was in the Block Ia configuration (small throat Main Combustion Chamber) with the exception of the Pratt & Whitney High Pressure Fuel Turbopump. It had previously been tested for 119 starts and 59,278 seconds. It was the fleet leader in both starts and seconds. Nominal operation was planned for the first 90 seconds of the test. The first indication of abnormal performance occurred 2.7 seconds into the start transient. High Pressure Fuel Turbine temperature measurements in two of the four locations began increasing beyond predictions. Other two measurements remained normal. All other engine performance parameters indicated normal engine operation at this time. The two high measurements reached the 1860 degree limit at 4.04 seconds. At approximately 4.97 seconds, the High Pressure Fuel TurboPump vibration levels increased sharply and engine performance dropped. The HPFT temperature limit was activated at 5.04 seconds and a failure identification (FID) was issued, accompanied by a major component failure (MCF). The control and data simulator (CADS) commanded shutdown. The turbine temperature measurements continued to increase after shutdown, reaching a high of 2165 degrees Rankine. Post test inspections revealed heat damage to the High Pressure Fuel Turbine. The Fuel Preburner fuel manifold was heavily contaminated with ""LOX"" tape. During the assembly of SSME 0523, tape was introduced into the fuel system during some ""hands on"" process (temporary closure, contamination barrier, unintentional introduction, etc.). The tape contamination went unnoticed and was left in the fuel system during the remainder of assembly and pre-test activities. On June 16, 2000, Stennis Space Center conducted test 902-772. SSME 0523 was to be tested for a scheduled duration of 210 seconds. At engine start the tape contamination was forced downstream in the fuel system, eventually coming to rest as debris in both the Fuel Preburner (FPB) injector and Oxidizer Preburner (OPB) injector. The amount of debris in the FPB was sufficient to block the fuel inlet holes to several FPB injector elements in a localized area. This blockage caused a localized high mixture ratio area in the preburner without affecting overall engine system performance. Data analysis indicates a localized temperature increase occurred in the vicinity of HPFT DS T CH A measurement and the HPFT DS T measurement at joint KG2dt beginning at approximately 2.7 seconds. At approximately 4.9 seconds, the localized temperature increase caused melting of the support struts and first stage vanes in the HPFTP/AT. The melting of the turbine stator caused local structural failure. The liberated material continued down the hot gas flow stream, impacting the first stage blades, causing the first stage blades to fail due to impact. This caused significant HPF turbopump imbalance. Data analysis indicates synchronous vibrational level increases of approximately 8 Grms on the pump end and 20 Grms on the turbine end. The levels continue to increase with the increase of imbalance of the turbopump; eventually reaching approximately 16 Grms on the pump end and 83 Grms on the turbine end. At 5.04 seconds, the HPFT DS T Launch Commit Criteria (LCC) was activated. At 5.08 seconds, 2 Failure Identifications (FID's) were issued indicating that HPFT DS T CH A2 and HPFT DS T CH A3 had exceeded the 1860 degree Rankine redline. These FID's were accompanied by a Major Component Failure (MCF) indication. The Facility Command and Data Simulator (CADS) was set to respond to an MCF indication before 6.6 seconds with a command to perform engine shutdown. The CADS unit issued a shutdown command and the engine entered shutdown phase at 5.18 seconds. The engine powered down nominally with the exception of the HPFTP. Its spindown was much faster than nominal. It stopped at approximately 4 seconds after shutdown (expected for a pump with severe imbalance).",,,,"Aeronautics Research, Exploration Systems",Public,Not Specified,,4/30/2001,,use

Benefit: Reliability block diagram (RBD) analyses enable design and product assurance engineers to (1) quantify the reliability of a system or function, (2) assess the level of failure tolerance achieved, (3) identify intersystem disconnects as well as areas of incomplete design definition, and (4) perform trade-off studies to optimize reliability and cost within a program. Commercially available software tools can be used to automate the RBD assessment process, especially for reliability sensitivity analyses, thus allowing analyses to be performed more effectively and timely. These assessment methods can also pinpoint areas of concern within a system that might not be obvious otherwise and can aid the design activity in improving overall system performance. Implementation Method: Analysis methods described below make use of RBD analyses and commercially available software tools to analyze NASA space system designs. They are equally useful for analyzing mechanical and electrical systems and identifying potential deficiencies in system redundancy and/or reliability performance based on RBD assessments derived from drawings, schematics, and system specifications and documentation. A detailed understanding of system architecture and functionality is necessary to assess system reliability using these types of quantitative analyses. The output of this analysis is valuable to the design and engineering functions on a program. It is more useful if a concurrent relationship exists between the product assurance team activity performing the analysis and the engineering design team, since design alterations and improvements can be made in near real time. These methods combine research, drawing review, reliability analyses, and the use of software automation. When this approach is taken, it is recommended that a team of individuals be involved to bring the necessary skills to the analysis, to share the workload, and to ensure that all technical areas of the analysis are covered. The RBD Technique: The RBD process involves developing block diagrams of a system or of a systemís function (tasks for which hardware/software systems were designed). JSC analysis personnel have developed both system and system function models. Experience shows that more benefits are realized from the system function models. When a function is represented as a block diagram, the models should include all operational components of the systems that are involved in the function and reflect component redundancy and subsystem-to-subsystem connectivity. The models are developed with a commercially available software tool and, with the proper inputs, are assessed for overall system reliability and design reliability concerns. Software analysis tools are an essential part of the JSC RBD analysis process. For these analyses, JSC personnel use commercially developed software for a personal computer. As with any analysis, it is critical that all involved parties understand (1) what items were used for input and what assumptions were made, (2) what calculations were performed, and (3) what interpretations can be made from the outputs. Inputs. To create an RBD, it is necessary to collect three types of information about the system being studied: functional systems architecture data, component reliability data, and mission times. Architecture defines the redundancy interrelationships between items within a system or function. These relationships are used by the RBD process in determining serial, parallel, and m of n relationships (out of n components, m are required for success). The architecture of the RBD is attained from a study of the schematics and other diagrams of the hardware, as well as the ground rules and survival assumptions that dictate which subset of that hardware is to be used. This information is entered into the block diagram editor of the software and is linked to the failure rate data base (into which data must also be hand entered). The second type of essential information includes failure rates of the equipment of interest to the lowest modeled level of detail (i.e., piece part, etc.). The third type of essential data is the mission time of each modeled component. The last two pieces of data are used to calculate the reliability for each item in the RBD over the mission time specified and is part of the overall function probability of success. Numeric Operations. The core of the RBD analysis is the calculation of the model reliability, usually done with a software tool. The functional relationships, failure data, and mission times are input to the tool and, using user-defined methods, the reliability of the model is calculated. Any number of probability distributions can be used for calculation, with the most common method being the constant failure rate assumption using the exponential distribution. Other distributions can be used, and currently JSC is working to understand early failure phenomena and how an early failure model can be used in the reliability calculations. The software calculates reliability (or unreliability) using the block relationships of the block diagram (interdependencies), the failure rates provided by the user, the mission time, and the user-defined calculation method. Probabilities are output in tabular form by a block, higher level function or nested block for the entire model, allowing the analyst to visualize where the reliability is being affected. There are other outputs as well, and they are described below. Outputs. Using the software tools for evaluating the RBD model, a point estimate or numerical calculation for the unreliability of the system or function being studied for the mission time specified will be provided in the form of the tables described above. The RBD analysis tools will also provide a cutset ""min-cut upper bound"" approximation, which is a list of the failure events ordered in descending probability of occurrence. A failure event is the minimum combination of failures that would result in loss of the modeled function. The most useful features of the cutsets are their ability to conspicuously display the most unreliable characteristics of the design (weak links), areas of incomplete design, and interfaces between two systems within the design which might exhibit low reliability. These concerns are easily identified within a cutset at the top of the listing. The cutset listings are helpful in assessing the failure tolerance of a system and can be used as an indicator of where further study is warranted. Typically, those components, which appear in the top cutsets, are investigated further by changing the failure rates of these components and observing the effects on the overall reliability number. This is known as a sensitivity analysis. If failure rate changes in one component have a significant effect on the overall result, then it is worthwhile to study the possibility of changing this component so that its actual failure rate becomes lower. Other sensitivity analyses are often performed as well, including changes in mission times and actual architectural variations. Utilization of Output: Interpretation and use of the output data are probably the most important parts of the analysis process. The data have been used for verifying quantitative reliability requirements when maintenance of a certain reliability level over a certain mission time is contractually required and this type of prediction is necessary for the verification. The results of RBD analyses can lead to further studies of functional availability, maintenance actions, maintenance times, fault tolerance, spares necessity, etc. The cutsets can be formatted for use by other software tools as input data to a much larger realm of functional simulation. Another type of analysis known as a trade-off study can easily be done with RBD analyses. Trade-off studies are performed by ""trading"" different system architectures for the architecture of the baseline design of the system and noting the results. This method allows the results of adding redundancy or removing hardware from the system to be quickly identified. To facilitate the analysis process, JSC Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance (SR&QA) developed several programs that interface with the software tools and enhance their performance. These programs provide the capability to do sensitivity studies through global modification of key parameters in the data base (e.g., mission duration), an area in which the commercial tool was somewhat lacking. Other such capabilities are needed when several runs of the model are being conducted in a batch fashion. A sensitivity study, for example, would require an incremental modification of the failure rate for the given component on every iteration of the model. To do this, one of the programs mentioned above will provide for access to the data base and modification of the component failure rates before every run in the batch file. As a sidenote, the commercial tool JSC uses provides a user interface that is somewhat difficult to use and, until improvements are made, some difficulties will exist in developing and manipulating RBD models and their corresponding data bases. Technical Rationale: The assessment techniques described above, which have been applied on several JSC programs, have provided valuable data on proposed designs. RBD models have been built and studied for the early design of the Space Station attitude control function (ACF), on both the Space Station baseline and all the proposed redesign options. The ACF is one of the most critical Space Station functions, because loss of attitude control in orbit could quickly result in the loss of the Space Station. RBD analysis was used to point out weak links in the baseline subsystem design and to assist in improving the design by pinpointing where reliability could be improved. Models were also built for the redesign options, comparing the reliability of the ACF of each and providing data that helped in the decision to choose the MSFC Option A. RBD models have also been developed for the latest Space Station configurations to assist the program in verifying quantitative reliability requirements set forth in SSP 41000, ""System Specification for the International Space Station (ISS)."" SSP 41000 states that the Space Station shall provide for 50 percent of the internal payload locations to perform at least 180 days of microgravity science per year in continuous time intervals of no less than 30 days at a reliability of 0.8 or better. To verify that the current Space Station design will meet that requirement, JSC personnel have developed an RBD model that includes all Space Station functionality required to provide for a microgravity environment. This model has been instrumental in showing that several design changes were necessary to provide for that reliability. Models have been built in the past and will be built in the near future to be used as inputs to functional simulations of Space Station operations. These simulations will provide input to designers in areas where more fault tolerance is necessary; e.g., critical spares list development, maintenance times and mean number of actions, and expected systems availability on a stage-by-stage basis. This type of analysis has been and will continue to be very useful to program management in defining and managing program risk factors. RBD analyses have also been performed on the Orbiter Project. The Orbiter autoland function was assessed to discern the reliability of the associated hardware/software configuration over a long-duration Orbiter (LDO) mission. The autoland function was to be a requirement for LDO because of ill effects on the Orbiter crew during extended stays in zerogravity. The analysis showed a high reliability during the 90-minute mission time window in which the autoland equipment was used. Over a 30-day LDO mission, however, reliability decreased substantially, possibly requiring future on-orbit maintenance of Orbiter systems. Other Orbiter Project analyses have proved the reliability assessments to be a valuable design and management decision-making tool. JSC's RBD analysis process has repeatedly identified weak design points that were not identified during qualitative reviews of the Space Station design. Results of computer-aided RBD analyses performed by JSC SR&QA were used by the Station Redesign Team (SRT) to make recommendations to the President about the merit of different redesign options. The SRT requested that JSC SR&QA investigate the reliability of the Lockheed Bus-1 attitude control system using computer-aided RBD analyses. The results of that effort weighed heavily in the early decision to use the Bus-1 on the ""Alpha"" Option in place of the ""Freedom"" baseline propulsion modules (Bus-1 is no longer in the design, since the Russian segment is providing that functionality). Such quantitative approaches as RBD analyses lend a heightened completeness, efficiency, and accuracy to any reliability design analysis.

Benefit: This practice provides enhanced reliability and availability as well as improved chances for mission success. Failure rates due to space radiation effects will be significantly lower, and thus system down time will be much lower, saving program cost and resources. Implementation Method: Space Radiation Environment, Essential Basics: Radiation in space is generated by particles emitted from a variety of sources both within and beyond our solar system. Radiation effects from these particles can not only cause degradation, but can also cause failure of the electronic and electrical systems in space vehicles or satellites. Even high altitude commercial airliners flying polar routes have shown documented cases of avionics malfunctions due to radiation events. Primary Cosmic rays interact with gaseous and other matter at high altitudes and produce secondary radiation. The combination of both contributes to the Space Radiation environment. The fusion process on the Sun's interior produces electrons and protons in great abundance along with helium and other heavier nuclei, which travel towards earth as the solar wind. This solar wind radiates out from the sun in all directions; but the flux of these particles varies with sunspot activity and solar flares. In addition to the particles originating from the sun are particles from other stars and heavy ion sources such as novas and supernovas in our galaxy and beyond. In interplanetary space these ionizing particles constitute the major radiation threat. These particles are influenced by planetary or earth's magnetic field to form radiation belts, which in earth's case are known as Van Allen Radiation belts, containing trapped electrons in the outer belt and protons in the inner belt. The composition and intensity of the radiation varies significantly with the trajectory of a space vehicle. Experience with many spacecraft since Explorer I shows that higher electron concentrations are observed between 45 degrees and 85 degrees latitude in both the northern and southern hemi-spheres, indicating that the belts descend to a lower altitude in these regions. For low inclination orbits, less than 30 degrees, the electron concentrations are relatively low. Due to the earth's asymmetric magnetic field, a region in the Atlantic near Argentina and Brazil, known as South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), has relatively high concentrations of electrons. The SAA is known to cause problems such as: single event upsets (SEU) in altimeter electronics gate arrays, and quothardquot SEU's in the Space Shuttle Orbiter's Star Tracker's Analog-to-Digital converter. The March 1991 solar storms significantly increased the charged particle distributions in the Van Allen belts, also creating a third belt. In addition to the trapped charged particles in Van Allen radiation belts (electrons and protons), the spacecraft experience radiation threats from high energy heavy ions in space called Galactic Cosmic rays, and secondary X-Rays or Bremstrahlung generated by particles penetrating the skin of the space-craft while they lose energy. This type of electromagnetic radiation is a significant percentage of the total component producing total dose effects. The usual (Centimeter Gram Second) unit used to specify radiation dose or deposited energy is the quotrad,quot which is defined as 100 ergs/gm of material. The material is always specified in parentheses, e.g., rad(Si). But the International system of units (SI) defines an essentially Meter Kilogram Second (MKS) units for absorbed dose called the quotgrayquot (GY). One GY is defined as the deposition of 1 joule per kilogram of radiation energy, i.e 1GY = 100 rads. Solar Flares also contribute varying quantities of electrons, protons, and lower energy heavy ions. Solar flares occur randomly at different times, and during times of high solar activity may contribute very high fluxes of particles over periods of hours or days. Heavy ions of various energies cause single event effects (SEE). A convenient way to express the transient charge generated by these heavy ions or charged particles is in charge per unit length, e.g. pC/micron. However a more frequently used term (but less intuitive) to express the same thing is called, quotLinear Energy Transfer or LETquot, which is expressed in MeV.cm2 /mg. In bit-storage devices the high energy heavy-ions cause bits to change, and are expressed in terms of bit error rates or SEU Error Probability. The SEU Error Probability is a number generated by computer from three data inputs: (a) the expected distribution of particles vs. LET, (b) the device cross-section for upset or latch up as function of LET, usually obtained from laboratory measurements, and (c) a calculation of expected error rate that combines the first two relationships with a calculation of the effect of the omni-directional particle flux on the charge produced in the device by the incident particles. Computer programs are available that perform this calculation. The net result is a fixed number for the upset or latch up probability. The following rules must be observed for estimating total dose environments: Criteria for Selection of Parts for Enhanced Reliability: For Space vehicles or satellites in low inclination (< 28 degrees) Low Earth Orbit ((LEO), < 500 km or 270 nmi) in both northern and southern hemispheres, typical dose rates due to trapped Van Allen electrons and protons are 100-1000 rad(Si)/year. For Space vehicles or satellites in higher inclinations (20 < I > 85 degrees) LEO in both northern and southern hemispheres, typical dose rates due to increased number of trapped electrons are 1000-10,000 rad(Si)/year. There are three categories of components having the following characteristics: Commercial: Process and Design limit the radiation hardness No lot radiation controls Hardness levels: Total Dose: 2 to 10 krad (typical) SEU Threshold LET: 5 Mev/mg/cm2 SEU Error Rate: 10-5 errors/bit-day (typical) Customer performs rad testing, and assumes all risk Customer evaluation and risk Rad Tolerant: Design assures rad hardness up to a certain level No lot radiation controls Hardness levels: Total Dose: 20 to 50 krad (typical) SEU Threshold LET: 20 MeV/mg/cm2 SEU Error Rate: 10-7 - 10-8 errors/bit-day Usually tested for functional fail only, risky Customer evaluation and risk Rad Hard: Designed and processed for particular hardness level Wafer lot radiation tested Hardness levels: Total Dose: > 200 krad to >1 Mrad SEU Threshold LET: 80-150 MeV/mg/cm2 SEU Error Rate: 10-10 - to 10-12 errors/bit-day Latch up: None present in Silicon-on-Insulator/Silicon on Sapphire (SOI/SOS) Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)- technologies Exhibit Low SEU sensitivity for SEE's NOTE: Although Class S does not guarantee that the parts are rad-hard, the design process does dictate whether a part is rad-tolerant or not. Using rad-soft components does not significantly reduce cost, but greatly increases risk. There are no components that are ideal for all parameters. IC design requires many tradeoffs in performance (cost included as performance parameter). Commercial components are useful only for commercial applications, where low cost, latest technology (even if it is immature), and high speed takes precedence over extreme temperatures and voltage ranges. Shielding these devices in Space Applications is a futile effort, especially for Single Event Effects such as SEU and Single Event Latch up (SEL). Total Dose Hardness Levels of Various Technologies: It should be noted that Bipolar device operation depends upon minority carrier current levels flowing through the substrate, while Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) technologies operate upon majority carrier current flows at the surface of the substrate. (Junction Field Effect Transistors depend upon majority carrier currents through the substrate). This is what makes their interaction with radiation different . Table 1 shows a comparison of Bipolar to MOS devices and radiation hardness. [D] Table 1: Radiation Hardness Comparison NOTE: Achieving total dose hardness in CMOS-SOS is more difficult than in bulk CMOS, but SOS does appear to offer advantages relative to dose rate, with respect to SEE. Silicon BIPOLAR technology is also heavily utilized in Linear devices, but analog devices require different transistor design characteristics from logic devices whose operation involves simple switching of logic states. Linear devices are affected by radiation in two ways. Low current transistor betas (current-gains) are degraded by surface effects similar to those which degrade MOS devices. Collector current (i.e. base current minus base-emitter leakage current times the beta of the transistor), is thus affected as a result of radiation exposure. When the leakage current (base-to-emitter) increases significantly as a result of radiation, the transistor will not function properly at low current levels, causing problems with input impedance, input offset and open loop gains. Bipolar devices (Integrated Circuits) often contain parasitic MOS devices, which present no problem in logic devices. Bipolar logic circuits typically operate at 5V with logic thresholds below 2V also helps. The parasitics typically have turn-on voltages in excess of 30V. Bipolar linear devices, however, typically operate at higher voltages (with positive- to-negative supply differentials of from 30V to 40V, making them more susceptible to even small radiation induced shifts in the turn-on voltages of parasitics). The problem is partially solved by design layout changes. Other processing characteristics such as the difference between silicon dioxide and silicon nitride (used for surface passivation) can also change the radiation tolerance characteristics of bipolar linear devices. With improvements in current technology, most such devices are rad-hard to one mega-Rad(si) level. One method to compensate for the transistor-to-transistor leakage current effects due to radiation is corrected by using dielectric isolation technique in bipolar devices. Total Ionizing Dose (TID) Effects in CMOS Devices: CMOS-Bulk Devices (IC's) experience quotlatch upquot due to a parasitic four-layer PNPN path, inherent in most unhardened devices. These parasitic four-layer devices act like a Silicon Control Rectifier (SCR), which once latched cannot be turned off without shutting off the power. Radiation hardening for total dose of such devices can be achieved by choice of technology and design changes to minimize the formation of such paths within an Integrated circuit. CMOS-SOS or CMOS-SOI devices do not have such paths and are inherently rad-hard up to one megaRad(Si), but are comparatively more expensive. CMOS-Bulk devices can be made rad-hard by introducing epitaxial layers to reduce the formation of PNPN paths, thus reducing the chances for latch up to one mega-Rad (Si). Single Event Effects (SEE): High energy protons or heavy ions lose their energy mainly through ionization, i.e create electron-hole pairs as they traverse through p-n junctions or the depth of penetration in the semiconductor material. Some of the deposited charge recombines, and some is collected at the junction contacts. The net effect is a very short duration pulse of current that induces transient at internal circuit nodes. The magnitude of the charge, which is generally much larger for ions with high atomic numbers, depends on the energy and ion type, as well as the path length over which the charge is collected. The effect of these random charges on the circuit depends on a number of factors, including the minimum charge required to switch a digital circuit state, called SEU's. Single bit upsets are easy to correct by Error Correction Codes but multiple bit corrections may lead to problems, and can be corrected by redundancy, etc. Also, memory devices are hardened by design to minimize single event upsets. CMOS Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cells can be hardened by adding capacitors, resistors, transistors or combination of these devices to the circuit, at the cost of circuit parameter degradation especially the speed. If the CMOS-bulk process creates parasitic SCR's or PNPN structures, the excessive charge may cause a Latch up, leading to a SEL, which can sometimes lead to the destruction of the device. It can be minimized by choice of rad-hard process or technologies. CMOS-SOS/CMOS-SOI, Bipolar and GaAs devices are not prone to latch up or SEL. Latch-up in rad-hard devices is minimized through design and process using (a) numerous, regularly spaced well and substrate contacts in design, (b) thin-epi/shallow well CMOS processes, and (c) butting of the source-to-substrate and source-to-well contacts. The only certain way to eliminate latch up is to use CMOS-SOS or CMOS-SOI process that eliminates one of the parasitic transistors, thereby removing the possibility of latch up. The problems resulting from SEL's are either immediate or latent damage which may reduce functional performance. Non rad-hard circuits or devices can incur damage from excessively high currents within a few microseconds. Once latch-up occurs, a device would remain in a high current, latched condition until power is turned off. Power cycling will be required each time latch up occurs, which will temporarily shutdown sections of the subsystem that share power supplies. Along with power cycling, circuits and subsystems affected by any component will have to be reinitialized. Another potentially catastrophic SEE phenomenon called quotSnapbackquot exhibits many of the characteristics of latch up and can occur in single MOS transistors structure. It can occur in SOS and SOI technologies that do not contain four-layer parasitic structures. A single high energy particle may trigger snapback if the field across the drain region is sufficiently high. Snapback is due to the prospect of a parasitic bipolar transistor existing between the drain and source region of a MOS transistor which amplifies avalanche current that results from the transversal of the heavy ion Cosmic ray particle. This results in a very high current between the drain and source region of the transistor, with subsequent localized heating. Technical Rationale: To ensure dependable and reliable electronic circuit designs, the radiation environment for Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Single Event Effects (SEE) encountered at a specific height and orbital orientation during the space-craft mission must be determined. Such data is available from NASA documentation such as SSP 30512, quotSpace Station Ionizing Radiation Design Environmentquot and SSP 30513, quotSpace Station Program Natural Environment Effects Test and Analysis Techniquesquot, applicable to the International Space Station Alpha. Goddard Space Flight Center documentation also provides this information. All electronic devices/components will experience two radiation-related effects in space. The first, the TID effect is time dependent, and the second, SEE, depends on many factors and is independent of time. The two effects must be addressed separately in design, and as such, this guideline will define basic ground rules for selection of rad-hard devices (radiation tolerant up to a certain specified dose) which can tolerate the effects produced by space radiation, within specified safe limits. If the power is not turned off when latch up occurs in a power Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET), the avalanche current within the parasitic SCR structure increases indefinitely to cause heating in the gate channel due to I2 R effect and leads to burn-out by a very high energy cosmic ray particle going through the transistor. Another phenomenon associated with the power-MOSFET's is the gate-oxide damage called single-event-Gate-rupture due to the presence of an extremely large electric field, which causes a force on a trapped charge given by [D] where q is the presence of a charge trapped within oxide, v is the potential or voltage across the gate, and d is the thickness of the gate oxide. Both of the mechanisms are fatal to the power transistors. References: David.

Reliability of the scientific objectives are increased by limiting the contamination allowed to the optical systems during each operation, which ensures that contamination during orbital operations is within specification. Implementation Method: 1. Introduction Contamination budgeting allocations for optical systems should be developed by the chief scientist, systems engineer, and the contamination control engineer using information generated from requirements documents, interface control documents, science working groups, contamination control working groups, contamination control review panels, contamination effects analyses, contamination testing programs, and direct customer involvement. The experience gained from other programs to budget and control contamination is also an input to the determination of a contamination budget. Another factor that should be considered is the cost of controlling contamination versus the scientific payback. The effective control of contamination may require: (1) investments in clean room facilities, (2) training of personnel in clean room operations, (3) monitoring of clean room activities and air quality, (4) acceptance of inefficiencies in working conditions caused by special clothing, restricted space and contamination avoidance provisions, and (5) potential performance tradeoff (i.e., use of cleanable or conductive coatings, modified thermal controls, and use of windows). 2. Budgeting for Contamination The two principal types of contamination sources for optical systems are particulate contamination and molecular contamination. Particulate contamination can consist of airborne particles, insulation shreds, clothing fibers, other human induced substances, and trapped particles in interstitial spaces, such as joints and crevices. When these particles settle on the optical surfaces, they cause degradation by obscuration and light scattering. To avoid jeopardizing the scientific objectives of the HST, the maximum percentage area coverage due to particulate contamination for the primary and secondary mirror was set at 5 percent. [D] Figure 1. HST Particle Contamination Budget Allocation Molecular contamination results from depositing outgassed products on optical surfaces, which may cause performance degradation at most wavelengths by absorbing the wave energy and/or modify polarization characteristics. Examples of molecular contaminants are lubricants, exposed organics, and volatile condensible materials. The allowed (per scientific objectives of HST) degradation due to molecular contamination dictates that the reflectance at 1216 Angstroms shall not decrease by more than 10 percent between the time of coating and five years in orbit. The operations that have the greatest potential for contamination have been allocated the larger budgets. 3. Reallocation The requirement that limits the primary and secondary mirror area coverage total contamination budget cannot be changed. However, changes may occur in the schedule where the operational budget may have to be re-allocated. For example, in the particulate contamination budget for the HST, the original allocation of 1.35 percent assigned to pre-acoustic fallout and the chimney effect and the 1.35 percent assigned to the acoustic testing were changed to 1.30 percent. The 0.6 percent assigned to the fallout and chimney effect after acoustic testing was changed to 0.5 percent. The total of 0.2 percent obtained from these operations was assigned to the unplanned rework and storage operation. [D] Figure 2. HST Molecular Contamination Budget Allocation Technical Rationale: For an optical system to achieve its desired goal of returning adequate scientific results, contamination of the optical system must be kept to a minimum. Establishing a contamination budget and controlling the contaminates within this budget ensures that the optical system will produce satisfactory scientific results.

Fault protection design maximizes the probability of spacecraft mission success by avoiding possible single failure points through the use of autonomous, short-term compensation for failed hardware. Implementation Method: Except during critical event periods, the primary purpose of an autonomous fault protection system is to place the spacecraft in a safe, commandable state which can be maintained for a reasonable period (typically two weeks) following a fault. During critical periods, the primary purpose of the fault protection system is to ensure the completion of the critical event. A simplified block diagram representing the following three general types of fault protection is illustrated in Figure 1: Subsystems alone. Subsystem to system, and System to ground control. [D] Fault Protection Allocations. All on-board, post lift-off, autonomous fault protection is designated as either quotsubsystem internalquot or quotsystemquot fault protection. Fault protection engineering elements which have been allocated fault protection responsibility must provide the requirements and design for the associated detections, monitors, responses, and diagnostic data in compliance with project functional requirements. Where science instruments include fault protection in their design, designers must still ensure compliance with spacecraft project fault protection requirements if one of the following conditions apply: The fault protection internal to the instrument is dependent on non-standard services from another subsystem (or another instrument), or Internal failures have an impact external to the instrument (viz, a change in power state, momentum, support to other instruments). Spacecraft Safing. Spacecraft quotsafingquot is a general purpose safe-state response which is initiated by both system and subsystem internal fault protection. The purpose of this response is to provide the following: A safe state for the hardware An uplink, and A downlink (with some exceptions for specific failure conditions). To achieve these goals, the normal stored sequence is terminated and non-essential spacecraft loads are powered off. Undervoltage Response. Most spacecraft designs include an undervoltage response, which is designed to protect the spacecraft in the event of a short or a bus overload. The hardware senses when the power drops below an established value for a specified time. If the criteria are met, the power system sheds all non-essential loads from the bus and indicates the undervoltage condition to the Command Subsystem, which will initiate the undervoltage recovery response. Critical spacecraft memories are maintained throughout the undervoltage. Functional Implementation Requirements. Fault protection is typically allocated to the on-board elements of the system in accordance with the following principles: Spacecraft versus ground control. Autonomous fault protection is included on board the spacecraft only if a response by Mission Operations is not feasible nor practical, or if action is required within two weeks of detecting the failure. Otherwise, ground control is responsible for fault recovery. In both cases, ground control is responsible for failure diagnosis and, if necessary, the configuration of the spacecraft to nominal operations after the fault. Protection against sabotage and operator errors. To simplify the development of fault protection, autonomous fault protection is not required to protect against sabotage or operator errors, although such protection is not prohibited. There is limited spacecraft protection against these failures (viz, information system data integrity checks and some software checks). Protection against spacecraft hardware and software design errors. To simplify the development of fault protection, autonomous fault protection is usually not required to protect against spacecraft design errors, although it is not prohibited if practical. The practice of fault protection typically provides some limited spacecraft protection against design errors (e.g., thermal fault responses). The autonomous fault protection function is responsible for all on-board fault detections and corrections except those routinely required to ensure spacecraft data integrity (viz, EDAC, Reed Solomon encoder, checksums, etc.). Data error detections and corrections may be used, however, for fault protection purposes. The spacecraft information system typically has the primary responsibility for ensuring data integrity. Fault Protection Design Requirements. Management and coordination of fault detection, monitoring, and response, for both system and subsystem internal fault protection, is performed in accordance with the following general rules: Enables/disables for responses. Where applicable, fault responses should have two enable/disable mechanisms (or the functional equivalent): an enable/disable by stored sequence, and an enable/disable by ground control or by fault protection algorithms. Enables/disables for monitor activation of any response. If a response can be initiated by more than one monitor, those monitors should include an enable/disable mechanism or the functional equivalent. Enable/disable state specification. Each enable/disable is specified by a single parameter unique to each fault protection algorithm. Enable/disable strategy - general. As a goal, fault protection monitors and responses should be designed to be enabled for the entire mission. This reduces the risk of incorrect fault protection states. Enable/disable strategy - critical events. For critical events, enable/disable strategies may be used to minimize or prevent the effects of an erroneous fault indication. Response initiation. Fault responses are initiated if and only if spacecraft performance is unacceptable, or there is a significant risk to the mission or to subsystem safety. Parameter modifications. All fault protection parameters which may reasonably be expected to change as a function of mission mode, type of activity, fault history, or operational experience should be alterable by ground control without requiring flight software modification. Software modifications. To the extent possible, monitor and response algorithms should be stored in programmable RAM. Configuration compatibility. On-board fault protection should be designed to respond to a fault while in any possible spacecraft configuration (e.g., fault protection should be able to accommodate all possible combinations). Independence from instruments. Engineering fault protection should not depend on science instruments or their data. Multiple faults. At a minimum, fault protection should be designed with the assumption that only one fault occurs at a time, and that a subsequent fault will occur no earlier than the response completion time for the first fault. As a goal, fault protection should be capable of recovering from multiple successive or coincident faults provided that the faults and associated fault algorithms are independent. Propagation of failures. Autonomous fault protection assumes that spacecraft hardware design ensures that a single failure in a subsystem (including instruments) cannot propagate to its redundant unit or to another subsystem, or prevent switching to its redundant unit. This can be verified by performing a failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) or fault tree analysis (FTA). Typical Fault Detection Design Requirements. Hardware and software detection sources have two criteria: Direct detection. Detection mechanisms should be as direct as possible (i.e., a direct measurement is preferred over a calculated or derived measurement). Detection coverage. Detection mechanisms should only be required to detect a failure to the level at which that failure can be isolated or corrected. Design Requirements for Fault Monitors. Software monitors used by system and subsystem internal fault protection have the following features: Monitor thresholds. Where possible, thresholds should use reasonableness checks, detection filtering (to exclude certain faults from a previously established fault database), or redundant detections. Threshold modifications. Monitor threshold values should be alterable by ground or sequence command, or by fault protection responses as appropriate. As a goal, monitors are best designed to detect and disregard failed sensors. Redundant detection. For detections where an inadvertent trip would result in a severe response (viz, downlink loss, irreversible hardware swaps, large use of expendables, critical sequence cancellation), and where a sensor anomaly could cause an inadvertent trip, independent physically or functionally redundant detections are employed such that simultaneous detections are necessary for response initiation. Fault response tolerance. Monitors are designed to be tolerant of off-nominal conditions following a reconfiguration resulting from a fault protection response (e.g., thresholds might be relaxed as part of a response). Design Requirements for Fault Responses. System and subsystem internal fault response concerns include: Fault response primary responsibility. Following an anomaly, fault responses should ensure spacecraft commandability and the maintenance of a safe state for at least two weeks. This requirement is superseded only by a requirement to complete a critical event. Fault protection priorities. Fault responses are designed with the following priorities: Protect critical spacecraft functionality, Protect spacecraft performance and consumables, Minimize disruptions to normal sequence operations, and Simplify ground recovery response, including providing for downlink telemetry. Multiple levels of response. Where possible, response design includes multiple levels of response, with the response actions executed in order of increasing severity. Real-time ground responses. Autonomous fault protection is designed so as to not require real-time ground responses for recovery from known faults. False alarm tolerance. Unintended entry into a fault protection response in the absence of a fault must not present a hazard to the spacecraft or mission. For critical event periods, however, this requirement is relaxed and is considered a goal. Use of redundant (and spare) units. Redundant or spare units may be used by autonomous fault protection responses if a satisfactory alternative design is not available. Unpowered redundant units. The transition of a unit from quotoffquot to quotprimequot must not require ground commands in order to support spacecraft fault protection and mission critical functions. Component warm-up times. Fault responses should take into account component warm-up times and similar delay requirements. Data Handling Requirements. The following data handling tasks are performed: Recording engineering data. The combination of sequences and fault responses should ensure the recording of engineering data prior to, during, and after the execution of any fault response. Some exceptions are made for recorder and command subsystems failures. Storage and preservation of diagnostic data. Fault protection is designed to include the storage of diagnostic data (see Telemetry and Diagnostic Data on page 7), and ensure that data are not overwritten as the result of a response action. This requirement only applies if the writing of diagnostic data is not affected by the original fault. Protection of critical science and engineering data. Fault responses must not destroy quotcritical dataquot stored on-board the spacecraft. quotCritical science and engineering dataquot must be defined by project policy. Requirements Interactions with Stored Sequences. The following interactions with on-board sequences may be necessary: Response design for critical events. Fault response is designed to ensure the completion of the critical event as and when required, with spacecraft safety having lower priority, until the critical events are completed. Orbit insertion is an example of a critical event. Response design for non-critical events. Unless required to execute a critical event, fault responses should stop any on-board sequence(s) only if the sequence(s) compromises the integrity of the fault response, or if the fault response compromises the integrity of the sequence. Reactivation of stored sequences. After completion of a response which terminates a non-critical stored sequence, fault responses should not autonomously resume the terminated sequence. Safing Requirements. quotSafingquot is defined as a general purpose fault response which results in the cancellation of non-critical sequences, the possible suspension of critical sequences, and a general reconfiguration of spacecraft components. Safing responses typically include the following general features: Uplink communications. The safing response provides for a spacecraft state and attitude that ensures uplink commandability in the long term. Downlink communications. The safing response provides for a spacecraft state and attitude that ensures continuous engineering telemetry with positive link margin. Environmental constraints. The safing response meets boresight and radiator environmental constraints. Safing priorities. When uplink, downlink, and hardware safing requirements are in conflict, the following priorities apply: Provide a safe state for the hardware, Provide an uplink, and Provide a downlink. Ultimately, uplink must be provided for in the long term. Benign spacecraft configuration. As a goal, safing responses should place the spacecraft in an operationally benign state. This includes but is not limited to the following: (1) powering off of all non-essential equipment including instruments, and (2) stopping of all non-essential spacecraft processes. Telemetry and Diagnostic Data Requirements. The spacecraft design should ensure that following an anomaly, spacecraft telemetry will be sufficient to perform the preliminary failure identification and analysis required for ground control to perform near-term corrective actions. At a minimum, the real-time telemetry stream includes the following: Measurements to unambiguously identify the current engineering subsystem configuration and operating status, Enable/disable states of fault protection software, and enable/disable states of fault protection dedicated hardware, Active/inactive states for fault protection software responses, Identification that a fault response has been activated, Monitor detection logic output (regardless of whether the monitor is enabled or disabled), and As appropriate, cumulative counters of faults detected. Telemetry design should ensure reasonable and timely sampling frequencies for these items. As a goal, the real-time telemetry stream should include monitor high water marks. A quothigh water markquot is defined as a measurement which identifies how close a monitor is to indicating a failure. Following an anomaly involving a fault protection activity, the spacecraft design should ensure that sufficient information is available to reconstruct the audit trail-- the sequence of fault protection events following the anomaly. Diagnostic data is also needed to analyze the anomaly and to identify the sequential effects of the anomaly on spacecraft performance. The data should be available in non-volatile telemetry or stored on-board for later retrieval by the ground system. At a minimum, diagnostic data should include unique identification and time-tagging of monitors and responses which have been active. It is also desirable that diagnostic data include the value of the measurement which initiated a response. Technical Rationale: JPL has incurred numerous instances of presumably redundant systems which failed to successfully transfer to the back-up path when the primary path did not function. A rigorous, systematic search, crosstrap FMECA, or sneak paths analysis could have foretold the failure, and redesign could have averted the problem. Prevention of propagating failures has its greatest value when supplemented by an on-board fault protection system. The practice of failure propagation prevention is of most value in a repairable system. Non-propagation minimizes the number of units requiring repair. In a non-fault protected spacecraft, this capability is limited to the preflight phases of either subsystem or system testing. In a fault protected spacecraft, it can be extended to the flight phase as well. The key to this investigation is a complete diagram of the involved interface circuits which penetrates each unit to a circuit depth sufficient to prove that no possible failures in one unit can propagate to become irreversible hardware failures in a second unit. Another input is a complete list of part or assembly failure modes for hypothesis. Successful transfer (or equivalently independence of the primary and back-up functions) is a necessity for either repairable or non-repairable systems and requires the same complete interface diagram and complete list of failure modes. Such a list must include items such as: Part failure modes (opens, shorts, stiction, etc.), Single event effects (latch-up, transfer, etc.), and EMI (latch-up, transfer, overvoltage). These last two items are critical since they can affect both sides of a redundant pair.

Proper design of solid rocket motor case-to-case field joints reduces joint rotation and potential leakage during ignition and operation. With detailed dynamic loads analyses, thermal analyses, careful insulation design, and suitable quotoquot-ring sealing, the leakage of hot combustion gasses through field joints is eliminated. This prevents potentially catastrophic burning or melting of the solid rocket motor and adjacent metal components. Similar benefits are obtained by using improved design practices for case-to-nozzle joints and factory joints between case segments. Implementation Method: 1. Background The Challenger accident (Space Shuttle Flight #51L) which was caused by the escape of hot gasses from case-to-case field joints in the SRM, triggered an in-depth, detailed review of analytical, design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing methods for solid rocket motor field and factory assembly joints. The case-to-case field joint was the primary target of the investigations and subsequent redesign efforts. However, other joints in the motor such as the case-to-nozzle joint and the factory joint between motor segments were thoroughly investigated and redesigned when the investigation allowed for optimization of the noted configurations. Reliable joint performance was achieved by a detailed review of the design drives and by comprehensive analysis, test, and redesign processes. 2. Case-to-Case Field Joint Improvements Space Shuttle Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRMs) are made up of four segments in which propellant is cast in monolithic form. The four segments are connected by the field joint shown in cross-section on Figure 1. The case portion of each segment consists of two cylinders connected in the center by a factory joint. A dynamic launch and flight load analysis confirmed that the field joint design, which has been the main focus of attention, needed to be modified after the Challenger accident to incorporate several improvements. The most significant of these improvements was the addition of a quotcapturequot feature, which is essentially an added circumferential band that is incorporated as an integral part of the quottangquot on the male side of the three case-to-case field joints. This capture feature creates an interference fit with the inner clevis surface and restricts the movement of the tang away from the two quotoquot-rings on the internal leg of the field joints during initial motor pressurization. The capture feature also incorporates a third quotoquot-ring which potentially serves as a heat barrier to the combustion process, in event of anomalous insulation performance. In addition to the change in the metal parts, the configuration of the internal insulation interface between adjacent segments was changed to permit an interference fit between adjoining insulation elements. This insulation joint is bonded with a pressure sensitive adhesive around its full circumference, and aided in its contact during motor operation with a circumferential quotJquot shaped pressurizing slot in the tang insulation. With the addition of the capture feature and its quotoquot-ring, a second leak check port, which also serves as a vent during assembly and a means of positioning of the primary quotoquot-ring, was added in the redesigned joint. This ensured that a redundant seal existed in the new design. A quotV-2quot fluorocarbon filler material was placed at the clevis tip between the primary and tang quotoquot-rings to reduce the free volume of the joint and limit the quantity of hot gas that would enter the joint in the event of leakage of the quotJquot seal and capture feature quotoquot-ring. In the new design, the inner clevis leg surface is machined to provide a sealing surface for the capture feature quotoquot-ring. The compression of both the primary and secondary quotoquot-rings was increased by increasing the quotoquot-ring diameter by 0.010 inch from the pre-Challenger configuration, and the quotoquot-ring grooves were widened by 0.005 inch to prevent four wall contact by the quotoquot-ring. All sealing surfaces were smoothed to an average roughness of 63 micro inches (63 millionths of an inch). A chamfered clevis leg was provided to aid in the assembly process. Each field joint in the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor is connected by pins (a cross sectional drawing of one of these pins appears on Figure 1). A key reliability enhancement feature is an increased-length pin with a circumferential pin retainer band. Each pin includes a hole which assists in assembly, and an opening with a dovetail cross-section to assist in pin extraction for refurbishment after flight. The increased pin length causes the dovetail to lie outboard at the outer clevis leg outside diameter. A stress analysis confirmed that this would reduce unit area shear stress on the pin because the dovetail is outside of the high shear area. This modification eliminated the potential for pin deformation. Custom shims were inserted between the inside surface of the outer clevis leg and the outside surface of the tang to maintain a constant gap between the two surfaces and to limit the growth of the metal-to-metal gap at the primary and secondary quotoquot-rings during pressurization. [D] 3. Case-to-Nozzle Joint Improvements Concurrent with the improvements in the case-to-case field joints, case-to-nozzle joints were also improved to obtain higher reliability and to achieve a more robust design. Changes to the insulation configuration, joint adhesive material, quotoquot-ring and quotoquot-ring groove configurations, and the nozzle attachment fasteners provide positive assurance of sealing. As in the instance of the insulation surrounding the case-to-case field joints, a pressurizing slot in the case insulation, coupled with a layer of sealant between the case and nozzle insulation, provides protection against combustion gasses reaching the nozzle or case metal parts. A circumferential slot is located in the case insulation near the interface between the case and nozzle insulation. A circumferential flow baffle is installed in this slot to prevent erosion of the insulation, and a stress-relieving radius former is included at the base of this slot to prevent cracking. To provide an additional margin for reliability, polysulfide adhesive material is used to bond the carbon phenolic nozzle insulation material to the asbestos/silica-filled, nitrile butadiene rubber insulation in the rocket motor case. A wiper quotoquot-ring in the glass phenolic layer of the nozzle insulation and wiper vent slot in the rubber case insulation were incorporated to prevent entrapment of air in the case-to-nozzle joint during assembly, and to prevent the polysulfide adhesive from contaminating the primary quotoquot-ring. The wiper quotoquot-ring also provided the second of two barriers (the first is the polysulfide material in the insulation joint) to inhibit gas flow to the primary seal. Stress analysis studies and strength testing proved that radial bolts, as well as longitudinal bolts, were required to ensure an impenetrable seal between the nozzle and case metal parts under all environmental and motor performance conditions. Radial bolts ensure that sufficient compression of the primary quotoquot-ring is maintained to provide effective sealing. Increasing the diameter of the quotoquot-ring and redimensioning the quotoquot-ring groove to provide optimum quotoquot-ring squeeze while preventing quotoquot-ring entrapment were required reliability enhancement measures in the RSRM case-to-nozzle joint. 4. Factory Case-to-Case Joints Custom shims, widened quotoquot-ring grooves, slightly larger quotoquot-rings, increased pin length, and revised pin retainer bands were improvements made in the factory case-to-case joints. Because of the continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints, special joint provisions were not required in the insulation. Clevis legs were chamfered and undercut at the leg tips for consistent final configurations after assembly. Technical Rationale: Based on detailed analyses of key design and manufacturing/assembly drivers, the SRM case-to-case field joints have exhibited satisfactory performance in close to 100 solid rocket motors since the Challenger accident without evidence of hot propellant gas leakage through the insulation to the joint sealing system. The critical parameters associated with the case-to-case field joint, case-to-case factory joint, case-to-nozzle joint, and ignition system mounting joints continue to be closely monitored on a flight-to-flight basis to prevent the occurrence of undesirable hot gas transmission through any of the multiple seals provided.

In the past, preventive maintenance was performed without any guidance or regard for safety or cost concerns, as long as systems performed their functions. The primary reason for the development of RCM was to implement a preventive maintenance strategy that could adequately address system availability and safety at the lowest possible cost. The RCM process answers and directs preventive maintenance decisions as to the what, where, and when types of questions. Introduction In the past, product development and manufacturing engineering dominated the technical disciplines in the U.S. industrial community with operations and maintenance (O&M) taking a lower priority to corporate success strategies. This priority has dramatically shifted to the point that O&M is now on a par with the development and manufacturing disciplines. Concerns about maintenance and logistics costs caused this shift in priority. A valid question is how to get maximum use of resources committed to the preventive maintenance program. This technique discusses preventive maintenance and defines RCM as part of an effective preventive maintenance program. Some cost-benefit considerations realized through the use of RCM are also illustrated. Introduction to Preventive Maintenance The majority of systems have long been operating in the corrective maintenance mode. Corrective maintenance is the performance of and almost total commitment of resources to unplanned or unexpected maintenance tasks. Preventive maintenance, however, is the pre-planning of inspection and/or servicing tasks. Corrective approaches restore the functional capabilities of failed or malfunctioning equipment or systems. However, corrective maintenance is more costly than preventive maintenance because of the unplanned interruptions of operations, idle time waiting for spare parts, and haphazard troubleshooting for failure causes. Preventive Maintenance Program In general, when creating a new or upgrading an existing preventive maintenance program, two items of essential information are required: (1) identification of what preventive maintenance tasks are to be performed and (2) when each task should be performed (see Figure 1). [D] Whatever method is used to determine what or if a task is to be performed results in a time-directed, condition-directed, or failure-finding task selection or a run-to-failure decision (as defined above). The next step is to incorporate the preventive maintenance program into the existing operations infrastructure and to ensure that it is implemented in everyday operations. Moreover, a series of questions must be answered before any program can be implemented. Typically, such questions might include the following: Are new procedures or modifications to existing procedures required? Are all the standard materials (tools, filters, etc.) available? Is any special tooling or instrumentation required? Are an appropriate number of people available to conduct the program? Are any capital investments required? Will the new/upgraded program affect the quantity of on-hand spares required? How long will it take to incorporate the new/upgraded program into the maintenance management information system (MMIS)? Is the existing MMIS capable of accepting the entire new/upgraded program (e.g., tracking time sequenced data in condition-directed tasks)? If full shutdown must be periodically planned, do the tasks and task intervals lend themselves to such a schedule? Do new tasks require a cycle that is a common denominator with other existing task intervals? Preventive Maintenance Program Elements Figure 1 is a simplified illustration of a preventive maintenance program development. Many supporting management and technical disciplines are involved in the development of the ideal preventive maintenance program and task packaging, and they are important in supporting the RCM concept that is discussed later in this technique. The important supporting technologies used in the development process are described below. A product malfunction or failure can present a significant learning opportunity in that much technical knowledge can be gained from comprehensive failure reporting, root cause analysis, and corrective action feedback programs. Without such programs, it is virtually impossible to establish proper corrective action or to intelligently decide if any preventive maintenance action is possible. A good failure reporting system is vital to the quotretain or increase mean-time between failuresquot portion of an availability improvement program. To prudently employ condition-directed tasks requires an entire diagnostic technology that is still evolving with new techniques and applications. The technology is dedicated to following, understanding, and contributing to the area generally referred to as quotpredictive maintenance technology.quot Some of the tools that comprise predictive maintenance technology are as follows: Vibration, pulse, and spike energy measurement. Acoustic leak detection. Thermal imaging. Fiber optic inspection. Trace element sensing. Debris analysis. Lubricant analysis. Stress/strain/torque measurement. Nonintrusive flow measurement. Microprocessors with expert system software. Preventive Maintenance Task Packaging This task consists of three major elements: Task Specification. The task specification provides complete technical definition and direction of specific requirements to the implementing maintenance organization. This document, which is the key transition from the ideal to the real world, either (1) details the data measurement and evaluation requirements for a condition-directed task along with the limiting acceptance criteria or (2) specifies critical requirements that must be met in a time-directed overhaul task. Procedure. The procedure is a basic document that guides the execution of a preventive maintenance task. The document may be a one page instruction for a simple task or complex details on precisely how the preventive maintenance task is to be achieved. Logistics. The logistics entail a variety of administrative and production support activities. Typical logistic considerations include tooling, spare parts, vendor support, training, documents and drawings, make/buy decisions, test equipment, scheduling, etc. Clearly, these considerations closely interplay with both the task specification and procedure and constitute a major portion of maintenance planning. In summary, a preventive maintenance program can be created or upgraded by implementing the ideas given above. With the support of key technologies, it will produce the quotwhat taskquot and quotwhen donequot information. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) As conveyed above, the objective of most of the current preventive maintenance practices is to preserve equipment operation. Until recently, this has resulted in little, if any, consideration as to why certain preventive maintenance actions and are taken and what priority should be assigned to the expenditure of preventive maintenance resources. Almost without fail, maintenance planning starts with the equipment and seeks to specify as quickly as possible those components necessary to keep it running. RCM is not just another approach to this repetitive process. The basic RCM concept is really quite simple and might be characterized as organized engineering common sense. The features that define and characterize RCM and set it apart from any other preventive maintenance planning processes in use today are described below. Preserves System Function. Unlike the ingrained notion that preventive maintenance is performed to preserve equipment operation, the primary objective of RCM is to preserve system function. Although equipment preservation leads ultimately to system preservation, it is not the initial step in the RCM process. In RCM, the expected output is known, and preserving that output or function is the primary task. This feature enables systematic decisions in later stages of the process as to just what equipment relates to that function and does not assume a priori that quotevery item of equipment is equally important,quot a tendency that seems to pervade the current preventive maintenance approach. Identifies Failure Modes That Can Produce Unwanted Functional Failures. After preserving system function, avoiding loss of function or functional failure is the next item of RCM consideration. Functional failures take many forms and may occur in various stages, all of which must be considered. The loss of fluid boundary integrity is a functional failure that illustrates this point. A system loss of fluid can be caused by (1) a minor leak that may be qualitatively defined as a drip; (2) a leak defined as a design basis leak (any loss beyond a certain gallon per minute value will produce a negative effect on system function); or (3) a total loss of boundary integrity, which can be defined as a catastrophic loss of fluid and loss of function. In this example, a single function could lead to three distinct functional failures. The key to the failure identification feature is to identify the specific failure modes in specific components that can potentially produce those unwanted functional failures. Enables Prioritization of Failure Modes. In preserving system function, RCM provides a systematic approach to deciding what priority must be assigned to budget and resource allocations. Since functional failures and their related failure modes are as diverse as the functions and components they affect, the prioritization of failure modes is essential. Allows Preventive Maintenance Tasks To Be Judged As To Applicability and Effectiveness. The features described above help in developing a very specific roadmap to the where and why, of the maintenance task and the priority that should be assigned to it. Each potential task must then be judged as to (1) its applicability (i.e., will it prevent or mitigate a failure, detect the onset of a failure, or discover a hidden failure) and (2) its effectiveness (i.e., does it justify the spending of resources to do it). Generally, if more than one candidate task is judged to be applicable and effective, the least expensive task will be selected. If a task fails either the applicability or effectiveness test, a run-to failure decision must be made. Cost-Benefit Considerations. The primary force behind the invention of RCM was the need to develop a preventive maintenance strategy that could adequately address system availability and safety without creating a totally impractical cost requirement. Figure 2 illustrates the success of keeping commercial aircraft maintenance cost per flight hour constant from the late 1960's to the early 1980's. [D] Table 1 presents another way to view the impact of RCM on the commercial aircraft world. [D] Two significant points can be observed from these data: (1) the dramatic shift in the reduction of costly component overhauls during the pre-1964 and post-1960/1987 periods; and (2) the constancy of the condition-directed task structure. The reduction in expensive component overhauls, brought about by run-to-failure decisions, was made possible by a design philosophy that included double and triple structural design redundancy in the flight-critical functions. RCM was used to take advantage of these structural design features when preventive maintenance was critical and the run-to-failure decision was appropriate. The constancy of the condition-directed task structure is attributed to the fact that the commercial aircraft industry was one of the early users of performance and diagnostic monitoring as a preventive maintenance tool. It has continued to successfully apply this practice throughout the generation of the newer jet aircraft. The results indicated in figure 2 and table 1 have led to a growing interest in other such areas as nuclear power generation and electric utility plants. The obvious reasons for this growing interest are (1) control and reduction of O&M costs and (2) increase in plant availability. All of this indicates that the cost-reduction benefits of RCM that dramatically impacted commercial aviation offer similar potential dramatic payoffs in other areas in which complex plants and systems are routinely operated. Conclusion RCM is a logical approach to preventive maintenance which does not rely on any heuristic processes. RCM helps in making direct and deliberate preventive maintenance decisions that were not previously possible. It can also be used as the methodology for defining preventive maintenance for a such new systems as the Space Station. Virtually every organization that has conducted an RCM program has recognized the value of the system analysis process as a training ground for system engineers. In addition, the failure scenarios developed in RCM analyses may be used beneficially as simulator inputs to plant transient or upset conditions in order to anticipate such occurrences in the future.

Benefit: Using prudent and carefully planned methods for specifying tolerances and for designing, manufacturing and mating major elements of aerospace hardware, will result in a cost-effective program with minimal rejects and waivers, and will avoid costly schedule delays due to potential mismatching or misfitting of major components and assemblies. Implementation Method: Introduction: Elements of large aerospace hardware, such as those encountered in the Space Shuttle program, are often (1) manufactured in diverse locations; (2) manufactured and assembled by different centers, prime contractors, and subcontractors; and (3) manufactured and assembled in varying climates and environments. Several additional factors must be considered in establishing design tolerances and in providing jigs and fixtures to assure that the major elements can be mated successfully prior to launch. Specifically, the size and weight of these major components and assemblies (such as the ET and SRB) are so great that special consideration must be given to hardware deflection and deformation due to vehicle mass; wind loads; and environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric contamination. A variety of methods of calculating and allowing for tolerance buildup and for ensuring matching components at the assembly site have been developed to meet the specific needs of these large hardware elements of the Space Shuttle program. No one method suits all needs. In some instances (in the ET project, for example), the overall tolerance between major critical dimensions is the sum of all of the quotworst-casequot tolerances of the subassemblies. In the SRB project, for example, the root sum square of the tolerances of segments is used to arrive at the tolerance on major critical dimensions. In addition, adjustable supports are used at critical attach points to permit minor variations in matching and assembling these two major Space Shuttle hardware elements. This practice provides selected methods that have proven successful in ensuring that major elements of aerospace hardware will be successfully and accurately assembled both in the factory and in the field; and it provides methods and definitions of dimension and tolerance buildup practices that have proven successful in designing, building, and flying large aerospace vehicles. Master Tooling/Jigs And Fixtures: Master tooling should be used when machining a number of interchangeable parts to ensure that each part will fit and function properly. Another method of assuring interchangeability of parts during manufacturing is through the use of jigs or fixtures. This method is used primarily when an operation such as welding, drilling, or reaming is performed by hand on interchangeable parts. Example: Thiokol, Inc. is under contract to NASA MSFC to fabricate the motor segments of the SRB. These segments must fit together precisely when they are assembled at KSC; therefore, each segment must be indexed when it is manufactured by drilling the indexing holes in the tang and clevis joints of the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) segment using a master tool. All of the master tools are made from transfer gauges, and the transfer gauges are made from a master gauge, resulting in the same indexing regardless of where the segments are manufactured (see Figure 1). [D] [D]Master Gauge: The master gauge is a stable, heavy cast iron fixture into which the master interface hole pattern has been precision bored. The bored holes are lined with pressed-in, hardened bushings (see Figure 2). The exact location of each hole is determined by independent inspection and is entered on the master gauge drawing as a basic no-tolerance dimension. This drawing, and the master gauge it depicts, describe and establish the mastered hole pattern. The master gauge is used as a template when bushings are potted into the transfer gauge. Transfer Gauge: Transfer gauges are stable, rigid fixtures into which hardened bushings are potted with an epoxy compound. During potting, the bushings for the transfer gauge are held in the correct position by potting pins located in the master gauge. (As shown in Figure 2), transfer gauge is fitted over the master gauge before potting, and the transfer gauge bushings are located precisely before potting using the potting pins. After the potting material has cured, check pins are inserted first through the master tool and then through the new bushing location. Master Tool/Drill Jig: [D] Master tools are fixtures into which hardened bushings are potted with an epoxy compound. The transfer gauge is used as a template when bushing are potted in the master tool (see Figure 3). The bushings are held in position by the transfer gauge and potting pins. After the potting material has cured, check pins are inserted through the transfer gauge into the master tool to verify the location of the potted bushings. Master tools are used as drill jigs to assure that the assembly holes and pins and the indexing holes and pins in the tangs and clevis joints of the SRM segments are precisely the same (see Figure 4). Master tools are made from the same material as the SRB segment casings. Therefore, the coefficient of expansion is the same for both. It is critical that the master tools and the SRB segments be subjected to the same environment until they stabilize with the area temperature before attempting to mate them or initiate drilling. Inspection pins are used to verify hole locations in the SRM segment relative to the master tool. Mobile Launch Platform (MLP) Preparation for SRB Stack: [D] The support post #2 under the MLP is adjusted to a certain height in reference to a benchmark in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). There is a corresponding support post #2 and benchmark at the launch pad. Once support post #2 has been adjusted to the correct height, a triangular reference plane is established using two other points under the MLP. This reference plane is then transferred to the top of the MLP. The eight support posts (four per SRB) are then adjusted by the following means: Shims are added between each support post and the haunch which is permanently attached to the MLP to raise the support post to a reasonable height. Shims may be added under each spherical bearing for height adjustment up to a maximum of 0.5quot (see Figure 5). Eccentric bushings and the eccentric spherical bearings are rotated to bring them into alignment with a bias to give the SRBs a very slight inward pitch (towards ET). The bearings are then locked so they cannot move when the SRB aft skirt is installed. SRB Stacking: [D] The SRBs are stacked on the spherical bearings on the MLP in five separate sections, one section at a time. The aft skirt, kick ring, and aft motor segment are preassembled in another area and stacked on the MLP as the aft booster assembly. The aft center segment is then stacked on top of the aft booster assembly. The forward center segment is stacked on top of the aft center segment. The forward motor segment is stacked on top of the forward center segment. The forward skirt, separation ring, frustum and nose cap are also preassembled and stacked on top of the forward motor segment as one unit. All of these sections make up one SRB. The fit of one section with the next is ensured because their mating parts (tangs and clevis joints) were all drilled using a master tool. There is no alignment adjustment between the sections and the deviation from vertical in the quotyquot plane is +0.8299quot per stack. Tolerance Buildup Practices: External Tank: In the External Tank project, manufacturing drawings have tighter tolerances than the interface control documents (ICD) to eliminate the need for waivers if tolerances are exceeded slightly. The ICD tolerance for the overall length of the external tank (ET) is +0.74quot, while the manufacture drawing tolerance is +0.62quot. The ET assembly drawing overall length tolerance represents the worst-case stack-up of the major ET assemblies, and the lower level assembly drawings use the same philosophy. For instance, the aft dome roundness is +0.50quot, the barrel attach points are +0.02quot, the machined and fabricated (formed) parts are +0.03quot, and thin sections are +0.10quot. ET design engineers strive for tolerances of fabrication tools up to 10 times better than the flight hardware tolerances. For example, if the target tolerance on a part is +0.1quot, engineers strive to make the tool tolerance +0.01quot. If the worst-case tolerance on a part is +0.1quot, they strive to make the tool worst case tolerance +0.05quot, or no greater than one-half of the part tolerances. ET design engineers use the ANSI Standard for Dimensioning and Tolerancing for block tolerances; i.e., x.x=+0.10quot, x.xx=+0.03quot, x.xxx=+0.010quot, and x.xxxx=+0.000xquot. In some instances, match drilling is used during ET fabrication to ensure a perfect fit rather than using machine-to-drawing holes which would require a very tight tolerance on the machining process. Methods of Calculating Tolerance Buildup: In aerospace hardware, two methods are normally used to calculate tolerance buildup. They are the root sum square (RSS) method and the root mean square (RMS) method. Each seems to serve best for particular applications. The RSS method is generally used for calculating the tolerance buildup of large pieces of hardware like the SRBs when they are assembled at KSC. This method of tolerance buildup assumes a random ordering of the various combinations of the interface theoretical tolerances and resulting misalignments. The following formula is used for RSS calculations: [D] Where: A, B, C, and D are the tolerances of mating segments of an assembly. The RMS method is generally used in calculating the tolerances of piece parts for small assemblies such as pumps and valves. The RMS method is also used in connection with surface roughness. The roughness value is assumed to be approximately equal to the square root of the mean value of the squares of the heights and depths of the surface roughness irregularities measured from the nominal surface in micro-inches. This value is considered to be representative of the surface condition because it is assumed to give appropriate emphasis to the peaks and valleys comprising the surface. The following formula is used for RMS calculations: [D] Where: A, B, C, and D are the tolerances of mating segments of an assembly, and N is the number of tolerances. Environmental and Physical Factors: When designing a part and establishing tolerances, it is important to consider both the environment where the part is initially manufactured and assembled, and the environment where the part may have to be replaced or reassembled. Factors to be considered include assumptions as to whether the part has to be disassembled and reassembled at a later time and/or different location from the initial assembly. Tolerances of the part will be determined by expected variations in temperature, material, coefficient of expansion, humidity, wind load, or cleanliness. Example: Several precision components such as the LO2 and LH2 pumps and valves in the Space Shuttle Main Engine may be assembled initially in a clean environment of 68 degrees and low humidity. If it is anticipated that one of these parts may have to be replaced on the launch pad at KSC, the fit of its parts could be affected if the temperature was 98 degrees and the humidity 95 percent, if the wind was blowing at 45 mph, or if sand and dirt were present in the local atmosphere. Potential Cost/Schedule Impact Avoidance: Cost and schedule are two of the most important factors to consider when establishing tolerances. Designers should never specify a tighter tolerance on any part or component than is absolutely necessary for that part to fit and function properly. Tighter tolerances require more precise machining, and result in potential scrappage of parts or components at inspection. Excessively tight tolerances also require more time for machine setup and machining as well as extra time for inspection. The loss of material, the extra time for machining and inspection, and the potential overtime required to meet a schedule can result in higher overall costs. Example: The critical mating surfaces for interface mounting flanges designed for a pump or valve are required to be flat within .002quot. If the designer were to unnecessarily require the same tight tolerance on the size and location of the mounting holes, flanges could be unnecessarily rejected if the holes did not meet the specifications. This could increase the cost of the flanges because of the wasted material and machining time. Technical Rationale: The rationale for tolerancing is to assure that the majority of small and large parts will fit and function as they were designed to when they finally come together as an overall assembly. It is also essential that these parts can be disassembled and reassembled if necessary under less than ideal conditions with the minimum amount of effort in the least amount of time. The selected tolerance buildup and hardware integration approaches described in this practice have evolved over the past four decades of developing launch vehicles and their related propulsion systems and structures. Minor deviations have been made from standard ANSI practices in instances where the prior U. S. standards were not applicable to large aerospace hardware components, subassemblies, and assemblies. Specific design requirements, specifications, and procedures are described in detail in the references and in documents identified in the references.

Benefits: Conscientious adherence to proven concurrent engineering principles and careful design and material selection guidelines in the design, manufacture, and testing of aerospace composites will result in low rejection rates and high product integrity. Successful composite designs can provide design flexibility, lightweight parts, ease of fabrication and installation (generally fewer parts), corrosion resistance, impact resistance, high fatigue strength (compared to metal structures with the same dimensions), and product simplicity when compared to conventional fabricated metal structures. Implementation Method: Introduction: Composites are combinations of two or more distinct materials present as separate phases and combined to form desired structures. They take advantage of the desirable properties of each component. The manufacturing technique used to fabricate a composite structure is dependent upon material performance requirements, structure configuration, and production rates. The composite design and manufacturing methods discussed in this guideline are primarily for structural and mechanical applications and are composed of a resin (matrix) and a fiber reinforcement. Typical reinforcements are shown on Figure 1. [D] Performance of composite materials in aerospace applications is superior to conventional structural materials such as steel and aluminum. Composite materials and their manufacturing processes can be tailored specifically to given design constraints. The superior physical properties of composites allow for design with minimum concern for dimensional stability, corrosion, and crack formation. While it is possible to tailor the properties of a composite structure to minimize problems in these areas, it is imperative that this be taken into consideration during the design process. Composite materials are significantly superior to conventional materials in strength-to-weight ratio, one of the most important requirements of aerospace structures. Design: Concurrent engineering principles (i.e., the team approach to design using designers, thermal and structural analysts, manufacturing engineers, materials process engineers, tool designers, machinists, quality engineers, quality control specialists, and reliability engineers) contribute noticeably to the success of a composite materials program. Designs of composite components which are fault tolerant to known manufacturing conditions and variables should be selected. The success of a composite program is dependent upon establishing material properties early in the program. Establishing an accurate and reliable material property data base is one of the most important steps toward achieving a functional design. Experience indicates that the basic material allowables of a specific composite product should be determined utilizing the manufacturing facilities where production will take place prior to finalizing design. The preferred process should approximate the following: (1) define environmental and performance requirements; (2) review available materials against requirements to determine the family of material to be used; (3) determine materials; (4) determine materials allowables using material processed at the intended manufacturer; (5) proceed with design based on known material allowables; (6) test geometric configurations (i.e., special joints, specific contours, special ply layups, etc.); (7) along with nondestructive evaluation (NDE), use destructive evaluation to determine voids, ply dropoff, resin rich areas, etc., during initial manufacturing process development; (8) begin manufacturing production.

(3) Stress riser or discontinuity Recommended Design and Analysis Guidelines for Composites: During the concept definition phase of the composite part design cycle, all of the critical design parameters are established. Geometric constraints and material considerations are outlined in order to establish the amount of design flexibility allowable. Maximum loads, both mechanical and thermal, are estimated. Weight, cost, and producibility concerns should be considered at this juncture. These factors should then be weighted and balanced to produce an initial design concept. For example, thermal material limitations should be balanced against cost and producibility concerns to select the appropriate composite material. Likewise, the layup of the laminate should be chosen considering not only the desired load capability, but also the thermal environment. High heat transfer areas could be cooled by using additional plies to act as a heat sink. These two factors in turn are offset by weight considerations. Several preliminary analysis and sizing tools can be used at this stage. PANDA, an elastic-plastic composite shell optimization program, is used in the analysis of stiffened panels. For flat composite panels, PASCO is sometimes used for preliminary sizing. The use of a Computer Aided Design (CAD) package is highly desirable in drawing the initial configuration. The configuration is then subjected to stress analysis. Depending on complexity, the part may be subdivided into subcomponents for separate analysis. If required, a structural computer model may be generated. For most parts, a finite element model is generated using PDA/PATRAN and the surface definitions from the CAD drawing. PATRAN is used as preprocessor and post-processor for MSC/NASTRAN, which has the capability of analyzing composite plate elements. Aerodynamic, vibroacoustic and thermal loads are obtained from the appropriate discipline areas for input into the stress analysis. The vibroacoustic analysis is performed by dynamics loads engineers using MSC/NASTRAN as a processor and IDEAS as a preprocessor and post-processor. A temperature profile for the part is provided by thermal engineers using MIDAS, a finite difference thermal analyzer, and thermal material properties supplied by the composites materials engineers. For shells of revolution under axisymmetric loading, BOSOR, a finite difference structural analysis program, may be employed. A simple general shell element finite element program, STAGS, is sometimes used to obtain input loads for BOSOR models. For more detailed analysis at a particular point, SQ5, a point stress laminate analysis program, is used. Edge loads for a critical element from a finite element or finite difference model are input into this program to obtain more detailed results. Thermal effects may be approximated using this program. However, if temperature gradients become excessive, in-house developed software may be required. Although buckling coefficients may be obtained from NASTRAN, NASA-supplied buckling knockdown factors for plates with complex curvature are used to compensate for inaccuracies inherent in the finite element program. Specialized computer programs are used to analyze joints and fasteners and their interface with the composite parts. Bolt programs determine the capability of bolted joints under combined bending, tension and shear applied loads, as well as tension due to preload and differential thermal expansion. Clip analysis programs analyze metal clips using empirical data. Composite joint programs are also employed; for example, BJSFM is used for bearing loads, and JOINT is used for elastoplastic multiple bolt joints. Below is a list of representative commercial computer programs that are available for analyzing stresses and strains in composite materials under various conditions. The ones most often used by MSFC are indicated as: [MSFC]. These computer programs are available from the company or source shown in parentheses. ABAQUS (Hibbitt, Carlson & Solenson, Inc.)

There are sensitive manufacturing variables that must be closely controlled during composite fabrication. Therefore, using certified and highly skilled technicians is required. Typical manufacturing variables are heat input, cooling input, roller pressure, machine speed, tape tension, curing temperatures and curing pressures. Technicians must understand what to do when one of these variables changes. Properly controlled manufacturing processes will result in proper tensile strength, density, thermal conductivity, and interlaminar shear strength. Tooling: Major factors to be considered in the design and fabrication of tooling for structural and mechanical components are: (1) dimensional tolerance control and configuration stability, (2) location of parts in a structurally reliable assembly to give the lowest possible cost, (3) contour and size of the part, and (4) control of fiber orientation. Other significant factors which control final tool concept selection are cost, tool service life, heat up rate, total energy requirements, production rates and related facility costs. The tooling required to fabricate most composite parts can be subdivided into several major categories including ply layup tools, skin or mold forms, curing aids, handling tools, drilling and trimming tools, assembly tools, molds and mandrels. Additional tooling and equipment are shown in Table 6. Testing: Component, subcomponent, and generic structural tests are performed to verify analysis. Particular component tests may include elements of aerodynamics, vibroacoustic and thermal loading conditions, as well as significant externally applied mechanical loads. Subcomponent tests may be performed for critical areas of the component. Generic tests include flange and stiffened panel tensile tests, damage tolerance tests, and standard temperature effect tensile and compressive coupon tests. Inspection: Quality assurance for composite parts centers on techniques for validating the physical and mechanical properties of a cured composite. However, quality assurance begins long before the end item is tested. A logical approach to quality control follows the fundamentals of composite reaction control: (1) raw material validation reaction control; (2) material characteristics; (3) in-process fabrication/handling/tooling effects; (4) cure process control and documentation; (5) post cure machining. Visual inspection is used to inspect bond lines that are visible in the various bond stages and to detect any visible surface discontinuities and/or delaminations. Mechanical inspection is used to verify design dimensions, acoustics, input resistance, static loads and dynamic loads. Non-destructive evaluation is perhaps the most important inspection technique for determining defects in composites, particularly the defects specified in Table 7. Table 7.

Computer programs are available to assist in the composite design process. The mechanical properties and impact damage properties that have been derived from tests of various composite materials can be used by designers to select the proper material and configuration for the job. Research is continuing to expand the available storehouse of design guidelines, leading to the production of reliable aerospace composite components.

PD-EC-1101 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Preferred Reliability Practices for Design and Test. Benefits: Each of the identified environmental factors requires consideration in the design process. This assures that adequate environmental strength is incorporated into the design to ensure reliability. Implementation Method: To ensure a reliability-oriented design, determine the needed environmental resistance of the equipment. The initial requirement is to define the operating environment for the equipment. A Life-Cycle Environment Profile, containing this information, should be developed. A Life-Cycle Environment Profile is a forecast of events and associated environmental conditions that an item experiences from manufacturing to retirement. The life cycle includes the phases that an item will encounter such as: handling, shipping, or storage prior to use; disposition between missions (storage, standby, or transfer to/from repair sites); geographical locations of expected deployment; and platform environments. The environment or combination of environments the equipment will encounter at each phase should be determined. All deployment scenarios should be described as a baseline to identify the environments most likely to be associated with each life cycle phase. The following factors should also be taken into account: Hardware configuration. Environment(s) that will be encountered. Platform/hardware interfaces. Interfaces with other equipment. Absolute and relative duration of exposure phase. Probability that environmental condition(s) will occur. Geographical locations. Any other information that will help identify environmental conditions that may impact the item. The steps in developing a Life-Cycle Environment Profile are as follows: Describe anticipated events for an item of equipment, from final factory acceptance through terminal expenditure or removal from inventory. Identify significant natural and induced environments or combination of environments for each anticipated shipping, storage, and logistic event (such as transportation, dormant storage, stand-by, bench handling, and ready modes, etc.). Describe environmental and stress conditions (in narrative and statistical form) to which equipment will be subjected during the life cycle. Data may be derived by calculation, laboratory tests, or operational measurements. Estimated data should be replaced with actual values as determined. The profile should show the number of measurements used to obtain the average value of these stresses and design achievements as well as their variability (expressed as standard deviation). This analysis can be used to: develop environmental design criteria consistent with anticipated operating conditions, evaluate possible effects of change in environmental conditions, and provide traceability for the rationale applied in criteria selection for future use on the same program or other programs. A listing of typical environmental factors is included in Table 1.

Cooling Turbulence Vapor Trails Vibration, Mechanical, Microphonics Vibration, Acoustic Technical Rationale: Given the dependence of equipment reliability on the operating conditions encountered during the life cycle, it is important that such conditions be identified accurately at the beginning of the design process. Environmental factors that strongly influence equipment reliability are included in Table 1, which provides a checklist for environmental coverage (typical). Concurrent (combined) environments may be more detrimental to reliability than the effects of a single environment. In characterizing the design process, design/test criteria must consider both single and/or combined environments in anticipation of providing the hardware capability to withstand the hazards identified in the system profile. The effects of typical combined environments are illustrated in a matrix relationship in Figure 1, which shows combinations where the total effect is more damaging than the cumulative effect of each environment acting independently. For example, an item may be exposed to a combination such as temperature, humidity, altitude, shock, and vibration while it is being transported. The acceptance to end-of-life history of an item must be examined for these effects. Table 2 provides reliability considerations for pairs of environmental factors. Each environmental factor that is present requires a determination of its impact on the operational and reliability characteristics of the materials and parts comprising the equipment being designed. Packaging techniques should be identified that afford the necessary protection against the degrading factors. In the environmental stress identification process that precedes selection of environmental strength techniques, it is essential to consider stresses associated with all life intervals of the equipment. This includes operational and maintenance environments as well as the pre-operational environments, when stresses imposed on the parts during manufacturing assembly, inspection, testing, shipping, and installation may have significant impact on equipment reliability. Stresses imposed during the pre-operational phase often are overlooked; however, they may represent a particularly harsh environment that the equipment must withstand. Often, the environments to which systems are exposed during shipping and installation are more severe than those encountered during normal operating conditions. It is probable that some of the environmental strength features that are contained in a system design pertain to conditions that will be encountered in the pre-operational phase rather than during actual operation. Figure 1: Effects of Combined Environments [D] (Click image for a larger view) Table 2: Various Environmental Pairs High Temperature and Humidity High Temperature and Low Pressure High Temperature and Salt Spray High temperature tends to increase the rate of moisture penetration. The general deterioration effects of humidity are increased by high temperatures. Each of these environments depends on the other. For example, as pressure decreases, outgassing of constituents of materials increases; as temperature increases, outgassing increases. Hence, each tends to intensify the effects of the other. High temperature tends to increase the rate of corrosion caused by salt spray. High Temperature and Solar Radiation High Temperature and Fungus High Temperature and Sand and Dust This is a man-independent combination that causes increasing effects on organic materials. A certain degree of high temperature is necessary to permit fungus and microorganisms to grow. However, fungus and microorganisms cannot develop above 160°F (71°C). The erosion rate of sand may be accelerated by high temperature. However, high temperature reduces sand and dust penetration. High Temperature and Shock and Vibration High Temperature and Acceleration High Temperature and Explosive Atmosphere Since both environments affect common material properties, they will intensify each other's effects. The degree to which the effect are intensified depends on the magnitude of each environment in combination. Plastics and polymers are more susceptible to this combination than metals, unless extremely high temperatures are involved. This combination produces the same effect as high temperature and shock and vibration. Temperature has minimal effect on the ignition of an explosive atmosphere but does affect the air-vapor ratio, which is an imporant consideration. Low Temperature and Humidity High Temperature and Ozone Relative humidity increases as temperature decreases, and lower temperature may induce moisture condensation. If the temperature is low enough, frost or ice may result. Starting at about 300°F (150°C) temperature starts to reduce ozone. Above about 520°F (270°C), ozone cannot exist at pressures normally encountered. Low Temperature and Solar Radiation Low Temperature and Low Pressure Low Temperature and Salt Spray Low temperature tends to reduce the effects of solar radiation and vice versa. This combination can accelerate leakage through seals, etc. Low temperature reduces the corrosion rate of salt spray. Low Temperature and Sand and Dust Low Temperature and Fungus Low temperature increases dust penetration. Low temperature reduces fungus growth. At sub-zero temperatures, fungi remain in suspended animation. Low Temperature and Shock and Vibration Low Temperature and Acceleration Low Temperature and Explosive Atmosphere Low temperature tends to intensify the effects of shock and vibration. However, it is a consideration only at very low temperatures. This combination produces the same effect as low temperature and shock and vibration. Temperature has minimal effect on the ignition of an explosive atmosphere but does affect the air-vapor ratio, which is an important consideration. Low Temperature and Ozone Humidity and Low Pressure Humidity and Salt Spray Ozone effects are reduced at lower temperatures but ozone concentration increases with lower temperatures. Humidity increases the effects of low pressure, particularly in relation to electronic or electrical equipment. However, the actual effectiveness of this combination is determined primarily by the temperature. High humidity may dilute the salt concentration and could affect the corrosive action of the salt by increasing the coverage, thereby increasing the conductivity. Humidity and Fungus Humidity and Sand and Dust Humidity and Solar Radiation Humidity helps the growth of fungus and microorganisms but adds nothing to their effects. Sand and dust have a natural affinity for water and this combination increases deterioration. Humidity intensifies the deteriorating effects of solar radiation on organic materials. Humidity and Vibration Humidity and Shock and Acceleration Humidity and Explosive Atmosphere This combination tends to increase the rate of breakdown of electrical material. The periods of shock and acceleration are considered too short for these environments to be affected by humidity. Humidity has no effect on the ignition of an explosive atmosphere but a high humidity will reduce the pressure of an explosion. Humidity and Ozone Low Pressure and Salt Spray Low Pressure and Solar Radiation Ozone meets with moisture to form hydrogen peroxide, which has a greater deteriorating effect on plastics and elastomers than the additive effects of moisture and ozone. This combination is not expected to occur. This combination does not add to the overall effects. Low Pressure and Fungus This combination does not add to the overall effects. Low Pressure and Sand and Dust Low Pressure and Vibration Low Pressure and Shock or Acceleration This combination only occurs in extreme storms during which small dust particles are carried to high altitudes. This combination intensifies effects in all equipment categories but mostly with electronic and electrical equipment. These combinations only become important at the hyperenvironment levels, in combination with high temperature. Low Pressure and Explosive Atmosphere Salt Spray and Fungus Salt Spray and Dust At low pressures, an electrical discharge is easier to develop but the explosive atmosphere is harder to ignite. This is considered an incompatible combination. This will have the same effect as humidity and sand and dust. Salt Spray and Vibration Salt Spray and Shock or Acceleration Salt Spray and Explosive Atmosphere This will have the same combined effect as humidity and vibration. This combinations produce no added effects. This is considered an incompatible combination. Salt Spray and Ozone Solar Radiation and Fungus Solar Radiation and Sand and Dust This combination is similar to but more corrosive than humidity and ozone. Because of the resulting heat from solar radiation, this combination probably produces the same combined effect as high temperature and fungus. Further, the ultraviolet in unfiltered radiation is an effective fungicide. It is suspected that this combination will produce high temperatures. Solar Radiation and Ozone Fungus and Ozone Solar Radiation and Shock or Acceleration This combination increases the rate of oxidation of materials. Fungus is destroyed by ozone. These combinations produce no added effects. Solar Radiation and Vibration Sand and Dust and Vibration Under vibration conditions, solar radiation deteriorates plastics, elastomers, oils, etc., at a higher rate. Vibration might possibly increase the wearing effects of sand and dust. Shock and Vibration Vibration and Acceleration This combination produces no added effects. This combination produces increased effects when encountered with high temperatures and low pressure in the hyperenvironmental ranges. Solar Radiation and Explosive Atmosphere This combination produces no added effects. Environmental stresses affect parts in different ways. Table 3 illustrates the principal effects of typical environments on system parts and materials. High temperatures impose a severe stress on most electronic items, since it can cause catastrophic failure (such as melting of solder joints and burnout of solid-state devices). High temperature also causes progressive deterioration of reliability due primarily to chemical degradation effects. It is often stated that excessive temperature is the primary cause of poor reliability in electronic equipment. In electronic systems design, great emphasis is placed on small size and high part densities. This generally requires a cooling system to provide a path of low thermal resistance from heat-producing elements to an ultimate heat sink of reasonably low temperature. Solid-state parts are rated in terms of maximum junction temperatures. The thermal resistance is usually specified from this point to either case or to free air. Specification of the maximum ambient temperature for which a part is suitable generally is not a sufficient method for part selection, since the surface temperature of a particular part can be greatly influenced by heat radiation or heat conduction effects from nearby parts. These effects can lead to overheating, even though an ambient temperature rating appears not to be exceeded. It is preferable to specify thermal environment ratings such as equipment surface temperatures, thermal resistance paths associated with conduction, convection, and radiation effects, and cooling provisions such as air temperature, pressure, and velocity. In this manner, the true thermal state of the internal components of temperature-sensitive components can be determined. Reliability improvement techniques for high temperature stress include the use of heat dissipation devices, cooling systems, thermal insulation, and heat-withstanding materials. Low temperatures experienced by electronic equipment can cause reliability problems. These problems usually are associated with mechanical system elements. They include mechanical stresses produced by differences in the coefficients of expansion (contraction) of metallic and nonmetallic materials, embrittlement of nonmetallic components, mechanical forces caused by freezing of entrapped moisture, stiffening of liquid constituents, etc. Typical examples include cracking of seams, binding of mechanical linkages, and excessive viscosity of lubricants. Reliability improvement techniques for low temperature stress include the use of heating devices, thermal insulation, and cold-withstanding materials.

System design planning and processes must address hardware performance during assembly and test as well as during flight (the DS2 electronic switch design was almost impossible to assemble without an anomaly). Where the use of safing devices is required, the system design and assembly/test procedures must accommodate their use throughout assembly and test operations.",See lesson(s) learned.,JPL,6/20/1999,"During final assembly of the Deep Space 2 (DS2) Mars Microprobes, each of the two flight probes was inadvertently powered. [D] When Mars 98 lander reaches Mars and the DS2 probes are released from the lander cruise ring, a MOSFET electronic switch will apply battery power to each probe. This switch, whose design heritage is unclear, is to be operated only once during the mission. Two mechanical switches are used to provide hold-off bias voltage to prevent the electronic switch from turning on until the probes are released. Both mechanical switches must be activated to power the probes, which then remain powered unless all system power is lost. Although a safing plug keeps the electronic switch biased to the off condition during early phases of assembly, the design required its removal well before the completion of electrical assembly. The overall system implementation included the following deficiencies and vulnerabilities that were not well understood and were not adequately accounted for in the system design, the Failure Modes and Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA), and assembly planning: The electronic switch design permitted the probes to be powered if any of the wires connected to the mechanical switches were even partially connected to ground. An estimated resistance to ground of 1.5 megohm or less is sufficient to turn on the switch. The anomaly investigation determined that even the body resistance of the assemblers connecting the wires was sufficient to cause this very sensitive electronic switch to turn on. The design of the mechanical switches allowed an unintentional ground path to the probe aeroshell. This would inadvertently power the probes during assembly, causing loss of the DS2 mission due to an undetected battery depletion prior to launch. The design did not permit the safing plug to remain installed throughout electrical assembly. The electronic switch circuit design required external power while the batteries were being connected. Following completion of the anomaly investigation, design changes were made to electrically isolate the mechanical switches and retain the safing plug in place during electrical installation of these switches. Procedures were changed to require extreme care to avoid stray resistances due to handling following removal of the safing plug.

During ground operations, cool air is injected into the probe to prevent internal heat build-up and damage to probe hardware. Prior to movement to the launch pad, cooling was provided without incident by a JPL cart. At the launch pad, cooling air was provided by the facility and routed to the probe through a diverter box provided by JPL, as shown in Figure 1. After mating Cassini to the launch vehicle, cooling air was supplied to the probe at approximately 0.26 kg/s (35 lbs/min). This air was routed to the descent module via the European Space Agency (ESA)-furnished ducting whose configuration and effects were not fully communicated. This produced a high-velocity airflow in the vicinity of internal probe insulation. It was later determined that the desired flow in that configuration was 0.04 kg/sec, and the air flow was adjusted accordingly. [D] Figure 1. Worst Case On-Pad Configuration To assess potential damage from the high airflow, a borescope was used to inspect the area inside the Descent Module (DM) in the vicinity of the air inlet. A tear approximately 5 cm long was seen on a Kapton blanket, along with evidence of foam insulation particles. The spacecraft was removed from the launch pad and returned to the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (PHSF) for removal and more detailed inspection of the probe. The probe was cleaned, repaired, re-verified, reinstalled on the spacecraft, and transported back to the launch pad. These unplanned activities resulted in a delay of seven days in the scheduled launch of the Cassini-Huygens mission. A failure review board concluded that, although ESA originally had responsibility for providing cooling air to the probe, the responsibility for supplying cooling to the probe on the launch pad was informally transferred from ESA to JPL without adequately defining and documenting nor implementing the resulting new interface requirement. Thus, no unambiguous assignment of responsibility for interface control existed. In addition, the internal probe cooling configuration at the launch pad, prior to backshell close-out, was changed without adequate review and coordination. These two factors resulted in excessive cooling air velocity within the DM, which caused the damage.

The lesson suggests methods for (1) determining flight propellant loads and consumption and (2) determining the onset of oxidizer depletion and triggering burn termination.,"Premature depletion of one propellant can occur in bipropellant systems if engine and component acceptance test data are not properly considered when determining the flight propellant loads. The level of dissolved gases in the oxidizer should also be considered. For nitrogen tetroxide/hydrazine engines similar to those intended for use in future planetary missions, oxidizer depletion may be difficult to detect from accelerometer readings because of (a) the residual thrust of the hydrazine operating in monopropellant mode and (b) random slugs of oxidizer which may continue to be ingested by the engine for tens of seconds after the first bubbles are ingested.","For bipropellant propulsion systems, ensure that supplier data on engine and engine component acceptance tests are used properly in determining the flight propellant loads and that consumption data are available to mission planners for use in accurately predicting the onset of oxidizer depletion. Be sure to verify the level of helium or nitrogen pressurant gas saturation in the propellants.

Subsequent analysis of contractor test data on engine flows, previously unavailable to the customer, indicated an actual engine mixture ratio slightly higher than the ratio used to determine the propellant loading. This resulted in the depletion of the oxidizer about one minute prior to the end of the final burn required to place the spacecraft on station. The extremely large monopropellant burns required to compensate for the absence of oxidizer may reduce the mission life. The spacecraft was provided with two methods to detect oxidizer depletion: (1) a single accelerometer reading indicating acceleration below a manually set threshold and (2) multiple readings of acceleration values which are time-averaged at 60 percent below the last steady-state value. With the latter method active during the final burn, the depletion was not detected by the onboard software because the average acceleration did not drop below the 60 percent threshold. Severe line pressure oscillations, indicative of intermittent ingestion of oxidizer bubbles, indicated the main engines were still firing.

The test should be performed by JPL or a qualified contractor if the component manufacturer lacks experience with propellants. Heritage systems should be requalified to verify their functionality in mission environments for which they were not originally intended.,JPL,1/16/1997,"Incompatible materials in propulsion systems have posed a major risk to recent missions: Tungsten Carbide Ball Material: During JPL qualification test of the original candidate Cassini pressure regulator, the tungsten carbide/nickel regulator ball was tested for compatibility with nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and monomethyl hydrazine (MMH). Exposure to the NTO oxidizer for 28 days caused substantial corrosion of the ball, and a surface roughness corresponding to a 42% increase in surface area. Another regulator design was therefore installed on Cassini; use of the original design would have caused serious pressurant leakage and possible system contamination problems. Flow Restrictor Braze Material: The pressure sensing ports in the pressure regulators contain flow restrictors which allow the regulator to sense and respond to downstream pressure changes. During the Cassini and MGS regulator heritage reviews, it was discovered that the MO restrictors contained a copper-bearing (AMS-4774) braze and a wax lubricant, neither of which are compatible with NTO propellant vapor. Neither of these materials were listed on the materials list for the regulator. Long term exposure to this vapor could potentially produce enough corrosion products to plug the restrictor orifice, which would likely lead to an inability to sense the downstream pressure and failure to regulate tank pressure. Such extensive exposure of the same regulator to propellant vapors would not normally occur on an Earth-orbital mission where pressurization is only required for a short period immediately following launch. These materials were eliminated in the MGS and Cassini regulator design. One of the credible hypotheses which had earlier been posed for the loss of the MO spacecraft was the plugging of identical flow restrictors due to long term reactions of propellant vapors with an unspecified incompatible material. Teflon Swelling: When the Galileo spacecraft executed 3 large delta V maneuvers with the main 400 Newton engine, restricted helium flow through the check valves caused significant pressure drops in the propellant tanks. The pressurization system is designed to hold the tank pressures constant during propellant flow. Pressure regulator performance was found to be nominal, but the flight propellant tank pressure data indicated significant degradation of both the fuel and oxidizer check valves. Ground tests have shown that swelling of the TFE Teflon valve bushing and PFA Teflon seal due to months of oxidizer exposure duplicates the flight behavior of the oxidizer check valve.

The heat exchanger is attached externally to an aircraft and is used to cool a laser system within the fuselage. In the limited space available, with a conventional staggered tube array, estimates showed insufficient cooling capacity. Thus, a non-conventional design was developed with larger tube and fin area exposed to the ram air to increase the heat transfer performance. The basic design consists of 28 circular finned aluminum tubes arranged in two parallel banks. Wind tunnel tests were performed to simulate air and liquid flight conditions for both the non-conventional parallel bank arrangement as well as the conventional staggered tube arrangement. Test results are used in a computer model of the heat exchanger to predict the operating performance for the entire flight profile. These analyses predict significantly improved performance over the conventional design and show adequate thermal control margins.

The oscillation occurred early in the S-II stage burn and reached large acceleration amplitudes (thrust frame cross beam) of 33 g'S at 16 HZ, and the resulting large pressure oscillations shut the engine down at 160 seconds of S-II burn. POGO was not apparent for the S-II stage (probably because of poor instrumentation) until AS-503. AS-503 had a self-limiting, local POGO-type oscillation near the 480 second flight time. Concern was raised in the POGO working group over this oscillation and potential vehicle problems. After much discussion and analysis, it was generally agreed that the next vehicle could be made POGO safe by increasing the ullage pressure, which would raise the lox line frequency and decrease the gain and thus the instability. AS-504 did not follow predictions; in fact, it did the opposite. Again, the oscillation was self-limiting. A more detailed look at the pump and engine test data revealed that the increase in ullage pressure would bring into play nonlinearities, which would increase the gain and thus the instability. It was becoming clear that many things were missing; more data must be acquired which required improved flight vehicle instrumentation. The ability to model the bulkhead hydroelastic characteristics was very poor and limited to the first mode. Elimination of this shortcoming required updated analysis and a comprehensive hydrostatic test program for data and verification. Additional line and engine tests were required to better define these characteristics, particularly since no analytical approach was available. In order to maintain launch schedules, it was decided to shut down the S-II center engine 60 seconds early and avoid the POGO problem. This appeared to be the answer, since no real performance loss was incurred. AS-505 and AS-506 appeared to confirm this since no POGO was observed; however, the improved instrumentation was not on these flights but was planned for AS-507. The improved instrumentation detected several ""football"" bursts of oscillation during the flight of AS-507 indicating the POGO loop was marginally stable whereas nonlinear analysis was showing stable limit cycles. Further analysis on AS-508 indicated marginal to unstable conditions. The as-508 flight experienced severe POGO: oscillations started at 16 Hz producing an amplitude of 32 g'S or greater. The poor prediction was due to inadequate nonlinear characterization of the system. After the fact, modal analyses were conducted using three flights and test-determined nonlinearities, nonlinear pump gain, nonlinear damping, and pump inlet compliance. Using these nonlinearities, a reasonable analytical duplication of S-II POGO on all flights could be obtained without adjustments other than known vehicle flight-to-flight differences.

Look for potential sneak paths through interfaces between powered and unpowered portions of a subsystem. Address these interfaces at CDR and in the ECR approval process.,Sneak paths between subsystems or between powered and unpowered portions of a subsystem can result in excessive current draw.,The cognizant engineer must pay particularly careful attention to interfaces between powered and unpowered portions of his subsystem or between his subsystem and other subsystems to allow early detection and correction of potential sneak paths. These interfaces should be singled out for special attention during the design and development of all subsystems. Interfaces between powered and unpowered portions of subsystem circuitry should be specifically addressed at Critical Design Reviews (CDR) and in the Engineering Change Request (ECR) approval process.,JPL,2/24/1995,"Memory Keep Alive (MKA) current draw in excess of the maximum specification was observed in the Galileo Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) on the spacecraft in the Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) prior to the scheduled 1986 launch. This occurred again during subsystem test of modifications made to the AACS in preparation for the Galileo VEEGA Mission. Excessive MKA current draw had the potential of endangering the integrity of both AACS memories by pulling the MKA voltage below the minimum required for memory retention. It also had the potential for causing loss of contents of both AACS memories by blowing the MKA supply fuses in the power subsystem. Investigation led to the discovery of forty-one (41) sneak paths between the 10 volt MKA supply and the memory's unpowered 5 volt TTL interface supply. These sneak paths resulted in the 5 volt supply voltage being raised sufficiently to partially turn on many of the forty-one 78L12 interface drivers such that they were in an intermediate logic state, allowing each to draw as much as 30 milliamps of current. This provided the potential to draw as much as three times the maximum specified AACS MKA current.

Recommendations included simulations and other methods for thoroughly characterizing the electrical performance of cables.,"Design to JPL or project standards is not always sufficient to ensure adequate performance of subsystem cabling. In this era of rapid technological change, design standards, used successfully in the past, may not be sufficient to preclude problems in the present. Simulators of subsystem interfaces with other subsystems may not always provide adequate performance assessment for the spacecraft environment. Limited fidelity of simulators used during subsystem testing can prevent diagnosis of subsystem problems prior to spacecraft integration.","The cognizant engineer must fully consider the electrical performance of the cable in his specific subsystem application. The subsystem impact of simulator limitations should be thoroughly understood and documented. Additionally, testing with integrated breadboards instead of simulators should be encouraged. Subsystem equipment must be adequately tested on the spacecraft in all redundant configurations to ensure that equipment configuration dependent problems are found. Noise on intra-subsystem cabling must be thoroughly investigated as to cause and effects as early as possible in subsystem testing.",JPL,2/15/1995,"During system level testing, repeated Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) checksum errors occurred without the presence of actual memory content errors (miscompares). These checksum errors occurred only when in one of the four possible CPU-memory configurations and only when the Command and Data Subsystem (CDS) was accessing the off-line memory. Extensive troubleshooting on the spacecraft showed that the anomalous checksum errors were being caused by both AACS memories placing data on the data bus at the same time (bus contention). After further subsystem testing and analysis, subsystem engineers determined that the bus contentions were caused by electromagnetic coupling within the AACS intra-subsystem harness while simultaneously accessing both AACS memories. Specifically, data being placed on the data bus by the on-line memory induced noise on the address lines which caused the off-line memory to turn on its data line drivers during an off-line CDS Direct Memory Access (DMA) cycle. The noise coupling between the Address and Data lines occurred in spite of AACS bay harness design which was in compliance with JPL and Galileo design standards.

3,16-0441,"We were dispatched to the xxx fire in an ASM configuration. After speaking to the IC and IC{T} to determine and sync objectives, strategies, and tactics we discussed the needed tools to achieve the objectives of perimeter control {Full Suppression} with the IC and IC {T}. The fire was burning during peak burn period, in a high elevation mixed conifer fuel type with a moderate to heavy dead and down component, low to moderate rate of spread {3-5 Ch/Hr}, moderate surface fire flame lengths {2-4 ft}, isolated to group torching {occurring every 4-5 minutes}, Primary residences in the vicinity {within 1 mile}, a State Highway within 1/2 mile, a small community within 2-3 miles, and a high resistance to control due to access and fuel type {bug kill in the area}. The dew point at KXXX was -2c indicating a dry air mass in the area. The following aircraft were recommended to the IC and IC {T} based on conditions, fire activity, time to complete the retardant line, etc: 2 additional SEATS {Total of 4}, 2 Large Air Tankers, and a VLAT. We determined that based on load and return times, anticipated lag time in getting aerial assets on scene, it would take 2 SEAT loads across the heel, 8 loads per flank {16 SEAT loads total}, and an undetermined number across the head depending on timing of aircraft. To reduce cumulative transference of risk to the flight crews, increase efficiency, increase probability of success , and allow for all aircraft to be made available in a short time period we made the decision to order the VLAT with the concurrence of the IC and IC {T}. We were fully anticipating needing to double the loads needed by the time the aircraft arrived on scene. The order was placed thru the appropriate dispatch center for all aircraft and we began to work the fire to achieve objectives. We had a very candid discussion with the IC and IC{T} that if we do not get the aircraft needed we need to revisit ``the plan`` as without the needed tools we would not be able to successfully meet the objectives and there for not expose the flight crews to a loosing proposition. Approximately 1 hour after beginning retardant operations we were informed that per the Duty Officer {DO}the VLAT has been canceled. We discussed the issue with the IC and IC{T} and informed them of the fire activity, shifting winds, doubling of fire size, load and return times, cost of retardant delivered by the VLAT, and attempted to give them the information they would need to discuss with their Duty Officer. They made a few phone calls and informed us that the DO wanted some time to think about it. We informed the IC that the retardant operation would be halted until a decision could be made and offered our assistance to the ground fire fighters. During these discussions the fire activity picked up and the fire again doubled in size and began to spot short range {3-4 ch}. Due to the unnecessary delay and limitation of tools we were being allowed to utilize we began to suspended air operations and returned to KXXX for fuel. Also, during this time the winds on the fire switched 180 degrees, exhibited signs of high atmospheric instability {Rotors and whirls from the column} and the fire began to out flank our retardant line and move toward H2 which was staffed with unburned fuel between them and the main fire. Based on the lack of support and winds we halted operations to reduce exposure to ourselves and the other flight crews and recommended that the crews on H2 reassess their LCES and consider hiking off the hill. Once on the ground we made contact with the IC and they were quite frustrated and apologetic, I told them that I understand it was not their issue and we would help them in anyway we could, both the IC and IC {T} were very appreciative. While on the ground at KXXX the fire activity again picked up and a moderate to well developed column developed on the left shoulder, visible from KXXX, we were contacted by dispatch that the IC needed us over the fire ASAP. We launched within 6 minutes and were on scene. As an aircrew, it is neither appropriate or acceptable to limit what tools an IHC crew can use to construct line, we provide them with task, purpose, and an end state and allow the professionals to make the determination on how to achieve it. The reverse should be true from the ground to the air. Cost shall not be the sole determining factor when deciding what ``tool`` to use to meet the stated objectives. As a result of the above listed factors we halted aviation operations due to an unacceptable level of attempted risk transference and changing conditions.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

45,03-1365,"Aerial Ignition (Helitorch) After Action ReviewCrazy Horse Fire – MT-FNF-0092 - September 03, 2003 On August 30 & 31, Chrisman’s IMT prepared a tactical assessment of Hemlock Creek drainage and confinement options for the Crazy Horse Fire.  The selected alternative set trigger points to implement an aerial ignition (helitorch) burn-out operation west of Hemlock Lake and at the head of Red Butte Creek (perhaps as soon as September 01).  This tactic was selected as a low risk, low cost means to secure the fire from burning across the ridge into the Crazy Horse or Elk Creek drainages by spotting or surface fire. Helitorch ignition was selected to ignite relatively sparse, heavy fuels when ignited.  The pre-determined trigger point necessitating a burn-out was reached August 31, when the fire passed west of Hemlock Lake. The following discusses the operational and safety components of the action, and captures the critical elements of the After Action Review held on September 2, 2003.PlanningCritical elements of the Aerial Ignition Plan included:·	Preposition resources to implement the aerial ignition plan (Complex Prescribed Fire Burn Boss (RXB1), helitorch, Type III helicopter and module).·	Preposition air resources to use water drops to control flare-ups or spots across the ridge (Type I and II helicopters).·	Discrete communications channel would be assigned to facilitate ‘Air to Ground’ (helitorch platform to helitorch base; Burn-boss air platform, helitorch base, and Division); and helitorch ‘Deck’. ·	The Plan was focused on establishing a fire perimeter in Hemlock drainage that could be held with subsequent helicopter water drops.  Firing was also planned in Red Butte drainage to strengthen the hand ignition done there on August 29 and 30.Implementation – Monday, September 1, 20030700 – Daily operations briefing at ICP, which included notification that the helitorch operation would be conducted this operational period.0715 - Daily operations briefing at helibase, which included notification that the helitorch operation would be conducted this operational period.0830 – Helitorch Manager and Prescribed Fire Burn Boss briefing at helibase to all aerial ignition personnel; assigned discrete radio frequency confirmed/cloned/operational.1015 – Helitorch Manager briefing with helitorch staff, helitorch pilot, IC, OSCs, and Safety Officer at Helitorch Base (DP 8).1145 – Helitorch Manager and Parking Tender brief helitorch pilot.1210 – Operations and Prescribed Fire Burn Boss flies with 16K pilot for orientation and recon of the ignition patterns and sequence of firing. 1225 – Commence burning operation in Hemlock Creek, Operations Colla and Burn Boss Orton in Helicopter NXXXX, Flathead National Forest Lama which is the observation platform.  Helicopter NXXXXX, a Bell 206-L3, is the helitorch platform.Outcomes1)	An Aerial Ignition Plan was prepared and approved by the Forest Aviation Officer. 2)	Operational and safety briefings were conducted by Prescribed Fire Burn Boss and the helibase manager and by Div Z supervisor at H5.3)	During the recon flight, the proposed burn areas in Division’s A and Z  weresurveyed for personnel that could be threatened by the operation. Line personnel were not a factor in Div A since it was unstaffed that day. The ignition sequence and pattern was determined jointly by the Prescribed Fire Burn Boss and OSC, and identified to the ignition pilot during the recon flight. 4)	Div Z was staffed on that day with instructions on the IAP of:  “7. Control Operations. Continue to secure and mop up ridgeline to DIV Y break.  Portions of the division may be ignited per the Aerial Ignition Plan.” And“8. Special Instructions.  “…Operations will coordinate burn out with FBAN and Safety. . . . Notify adjacent Divisions prior to initiating the burn out.”Fireline personnel that were observed from the air appeared to be clear of the ignition area.5)	Personnel assigned to the helitorch operation were verified by AOBD and a Safety Officer as certified for their role. The helicopter pilot and all operational personnel met agency certifications and approvals for their respective positions.6)	During helicopter operations, the pilot, helicopter manager and Prescribed Fire Burn Boss are responsible for following all operational and safety rules. Operational, alternate and emergency helispots were also identified prior to operation implementation.7)	Burn-out and operational objectives were accomplished successfully.  These actions will potentially secure the fire in both the Red Butte and Hemlock drainages that will facilitate containing the west flank of the fire.  Issuesa)	Daily helibase debriefing at 1930 on September 1 and the September 2 After Action Review revealed:·	An unexpected short-burst ignition or residual hanging gel from the helitorch occurred within  a reported 50 to 60 feet of some of the helitack crew in Division Zulu.  This was within their assigned work area.  ·	Conflicting crewmember statements indicate that others of the crew may have been outside their designated area at the time helitorch ignitions were preparing to commence.  L&C Hotshot Superintendent reported some helitack crewmembers well downslope of their designated area. Instructions in the IAP were: “7. Control Operations. Continue to secure and mop up ridgeline to DIV Y break.”  Personnel had been specifically told by DIV Z to mop up one chain (66 feet) from the ridgeline. ·	Ground Spot weather observations recorded winds at 30 mph for approximately 1 minute when helitorch operations were underway (30 mph winds pushes limits for a Type 3 helicopter such as the L3 Jet Ranger).  Further conversation later between the AOBD and the helitorch pilot indicated the pilot was comfortable with the helitorch weight and the occasional wind effects on the flight characteristics of this helicopter.  He stated: “I would not have hesitated in the least to shut down the operation if I had felt at any time that I was outside either my comfort level or the capabilities of the helicopter.”·	Communications from Operations in the Lama observation platform (NXXXX) to Division Zulu were initially garbled due to wind in the cockpit (the Lama was flying with its doors off).  Helitack crew stated they did not receive clear communications from Division Z that the firing operation was to commence in DIVS Zulu. The Lewis and Clark IHC crew who were assigned to Zulu stated they were well-advised.·	There was significant traffic on the discrete air to ground channel (9) such that the Helitack Crew Boss quit scanning air to ground to pick up the tactical and command traffic.   In the AAR, it was determined that the assigned Air-to-Air frequency 120.675 was not used between the OSC/Burn Boss in NXXXX and the helitorch pilot in NXXXXX.  They instead used the discrete Air/Ground frequency of 165.825, contributing to the congestion on the discrete air-ground frequency.b)	At least one over-flight of personnel on the fireline with helitorch (unlit) during ignition period occurred. This may have been due to the pilot dealing with the wind along and just below the ridge while setting up to make a run into the canyon below.c)	Additional personnel working in the Division (five person Helitack Crew) were not identified or accounted for in the Incident Action Plan.  This crew was briefed at the Helibase, but did not attend the general briefing where it was clearly stated that burning would be implemented in both Hemlock and Red Butte drainages if conditions allowed.  These resources were known to and requested by the Division Supervisor and briefed with the other Crew at the Divisional briefing.  At this briefing they were informed of the probable burn out of Division Zulu.d)	Division informed personnel that the helitorch was incoming, but there were conflicting statements about when this notification occurred. All Division personnel were instructed by Division to be within one chain of the ridge at the Division briefing in the morning. Division believed all personnel were operating per instructions but did not specifically confirm that all personnel were clear of the ignition operation.e)	Prior to ignition in the second operational area, a dry run was conducted by the Burn Boss and OSC in the Lama and helitorch pilot and witnessed by Division personnel, although there are conflicting statements about whether all ground personnel (e.g., the 5-person helitack crew) witnessed the dry run before ignition.f)	Concerns for wind effects on helicopter flight were neither noted nor addressed during mid-ignition helitorch operations. (Further conversation between AOBD and the helitorch pilot indicated the pilot was comfortable with the capability of the Bell 206 LR3 to carry the helitorch weight and with the occasional wind effects on the flight characteristics of this helicopter.  g)	The pilot also indicated he had checked the helitorch over the hard black and that it worked “pretty darn good.”  The pilot further stated that he had checked the torch for residual gel prior to transiting from Div A to Div Z and that it was clean. He also stated that he did not knowingly test fire or otherwise activate the helitorch on his first approach into the head of Red Butte Creek near the helitack crew.  h)	Neither the  Helitack Crewmembers nor their supervisor in proximity to the short burst reported the incident to their crew boss until later in the afternoon, and the incident did not surface outside the crew until 1930 at the helibase debriefing.

68,08-0382,"At approximately 2030 hrs on 6/23/08,during initial attack of the Piedra fire {CO-SUA}, one of the six smokejumpers being delivered to the fire was severely injured. Initial reports were a fractured femur with possible tissue/artery damage. Smokejumpers on scene were rendering medical aid and requested a medevac. At this same time, NPS exclusive use helicopter and module {NXXX} were departing this same fire for base and responded to the jump spot. Local EMS helicopter ordered at same time. Once over the jump spot, it was determined by the pilot and helicopter manager that the site was a no-go for the inbound EMS helicopter {Agusta A119}. This was due to the small size and slope of the potential helispot. After weighing the options, NXXX and crew landed and configured aircraft with litter kit. Helicopter then returned to jump spot with HMGB and HECM {both EMTB} to attempt a landing and patient retrieval. Once over the site, the pilot and manager evaluated the situation and due to the significant risk to the patients life, time of day and no ground options for evacuation, it was decided to attempt a landing in this marginal site. The pilot was able to maneuver the aircraft onto the one possible landing site, however the slope exceeded the limit for the NXXX. The pilot brought the aircraft onto the spot, but needed to maintain full power with the back half of the skids off of the ground during the loading of the injured firefighter. Once on the ground, the HMGB and HECM exited, briefed the 5 other jumpers on scene about the loading process and the patient was loaded on aircraft. Helitack crew boarded and the aircraft departed the spot at approximately 2050 hrs. Patient flown directly to Mercy Medical Center in Durango, arrival 2100 hrs. Patient and helitack crew offloaded and NXXX departed for airport, arriving at approximately 2110. As the Helicopter Manager, I feel that the pilot did an exceptional job during this emergency situation. He was able to skillfully pilot the aircraft into a very difficult spot, during low light conditions and successfully retrieve the injured before dark. This injured smokejumper was delivered to the hospital less than one hour after his injury. There were several deviations from policy and SOPs during this operation due to the emergency situation. These were all discussed between pilot and Helicopter Mgr. prior to completing the medevac.

100,11-0767,"on august 3, 2011 a state of montana mt205 was dispatched to initial attack a fire 12 miles northeast of bonner, mt. upon arrival at the fire {rainbow bend 961001} the helitack crew attached the bambi bucket to the aircraft and began to fight the fire. the pilot proceeded to the blackfoot river, about ¼ mile north of the fire and commenced bucket operations. following the fourth bucket drop, the aircraft was returning to the river and was in a left turn when the pilot experienced the following: 1. grinding noises coming from the engine/transmission area. 2. excessive vibration. 3. a droop or reduction in rotor rpm. 4. surges in engine rpm. the pilot elected to perform a precautionary landing based on the aircraft behavior. landing options were extremely limited in the area. the pilot initially considered landing on highway 200 but the traffic was too heavy. adjacent to the highway was a small parking area used to access the river. several vehicles were parked in this area with people present. the pilot opted to split the difference between the parking area and the highway and landed on the turn-off area leading into the parking area. this turn-off area resulted in the aircraft landing with 9 degrees of lateral slope from right to left and 4 degrees nose up. the pilot did not jettison the bambi bucket on approach to the landing area, which resulted in his making a near vertical descent to the landing. the bucket was located to the left rear of the left skid, down slope from the aircraft. the bucket cables and bucket position indicated the bucket was placed and not dragged during landing. during the landing the aircraft moved forward about 18 inches from the initial touchdown point of the right rear skid tube. as the pilot placed the aircraft on the slope the aircraft slid about 16 inches down slope as the aircraft came to rest. there was a curved guard rail immediately aft of the aircraft. the final position of the aircraft resulted in a 20 inch separation of the tail skid and the guard rail. evidence suggests that the tail skid and tail rotor were over the guard rail during the landing event. no contact between the aircraft and guard rail occurred. the pilot attempted to perform an emergency engine shut-down following the landing, but failed to move the throttle past the idle cut-off position. the main fuel, and battery switches were placed in the off position. the pilot safely exited the aircraft, retrieved the fire extinguisher. the aircraft produced smoke from the engine/transmission for about 20 minutes after landing.

132,03-0848,"Statement by the Helicopter Manager and Pilot:Helicopter 5738Y was assigned to fly the Isabel fire 20 minutes SW of the Needle Fire. I asked the pilot if he needed the communication information and he said that the Situation Unit Leader made the arrangements to go to the Isabel fire. Prior to departure, the pilot stopped by the Foster Helibase communication trailer to inform them he had been ordered to IR map the fire, Isabel. He was asked if he had the frequencies for the Isabel. He said he had received them from the Needle Air Attack the day before (on 9/14).5738Y departed the Foster Helibase at 1330. In route to the Isabel fire until 1405. 8 miles out, 38Y attempted to contact Salmon Helibase on the given frequency with no result. The pilot tried again a second time again with no avail. 38Y pilot then tried a secondary frequency (not utilized the day before) given to the pilot by the Needle Air Attack. On that frequency he communicated with the Salmon Air Attack and discovered that he had flown into an active air operation.Note: On 9/14 the previous day, 38Y was dispatched to the same fire and the Foster Helibase communications said there were no air operations taking place on the Isabel. Arriving on the fire, there was one type 2 on the ground at the Salmon Helibase.Corrective Actions:Situations needs to go through the proper ordering channel by using the Air Operations Branch Director to place the order. By doing this both Teams will know what aircraft are being used on that incident and can give permission for the flight.Statement by ATGS on 9/15:On 9/15/03 received a request at approx. 10 am for ATGS mission on Isabel fire #637. Aircraft Dispatcher, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, was told at time of request about a new air-to-ground and new victor frequency that he mentioned to me he was unaware of . The requests had not gone thru proper resource order request channels. He spoke with requesting resource about this.During ATGS mission over Isabel at approx. 1400 I spotted a jet ranger in the fire airspace over a ridge where Lead 69 and air tankers were working. I immediately notified Lead 69 and inquired at Salmon helibase if they knew about this helicopter. They did not. Soon after that 38Y identified himself saying his mission was mapping. I told him that would not be possible at this time as we had T-62 about 2 minutes out and another tanker soon after. I moved him east of the fire camp area or said he could set down at Salmon helibase. I told him to stay below 7,000’. Lead 69 then requested he move north and east of the fire camp as directly east would be “the down and out” for the tankers how he was setting that up. 38Y stated he had tried to contact the fire using yesterdays frequencies and when no one answered, assumed on one was over the fire so came on into airspace. I gave him the correct (new) frequencies and both Lead 69 and myself discussed the situation that had occurred with him over the radio as we were departing fire, mission complete.Statement by Aircraft Dispatcher:At 0946 received a radio call from Air Ops requesting our Air Attack 634CT to come to Isabel Fire to access need for Air Tankers on incident. At that time he gave me new victor Freq. and new Air Ground Freq. I asked him where they got the new Freqs, since I had no request from ICP for new Freqs for the incident., he told me he got Freqs from the  communication unit leader. I then called the Communication Unit Leader and asked him where he got the Freqs and he told me he called NIC and got them from them. I then told him since I had the Aircraft Orders for the Incident and that the orders needed to come through me at CWICC so I could track them in Ross and coordinate those freqs with our responding  aircraft.  I knew nothing about the Isabel Fire contacting the Needle Fire and requesting the use of a helicopter, which the order should have came through me at CWICC since I have all aircraft for both  Incidents and they need to be tracked in Ross for proper payment and tracking of aircraft use. If the proper procedures would of been followed the Freqs would have been passed on to N38Y before he was dispatched to the Isabel Fire.  I knew nothing about the near miss over incident until later when XXXXXXXX -Helibase Manager for the Needle Fire called me and told me about what happened.Statement by XXXXXXXXX, ASGS Isabel:Helicopter 38Y departed the Needles fire to map the Isabel fire without the proper radio frequencies. 38Y failed to establish contact at 12NM from the Isabel fire and did not hold at 7NM when contact was not established with Air Attack or the Helibase.The first contact with 38Y was with Air Attack as 38Y flew into the fire area.

They were originally headed to the 123 fire, but due to the lack of a Lead plane, ended up needing to jettison a load of retardant. Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}1 relayed the lat/long for the South Ridge Promontory Point jettison site to the pilot via radio on the National Flight Follow NFF frequency. The lat/long given was 40 16.9833 x 112 28.4000, which was obtained via a paper sign that hangs behind the aircraft desk. Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}1 went off shift, and briefed Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}2. At 2052, as the T-XYZ appeared over the Great Salt Lake in AFF, he came up on NFF and said that he had passed the jettison point, mentioned Tooele Army Depot, and Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}2 confirmed the coordinates we had with him. He confirmed the coordinates, said that it was behind him and he needed to do a 180 to get there and asked if that is what we’d like him to do. We looked at AFF, and grabbed a GPS point from the program, which was at 41 17.1546 x 112 33.304, was ½ mile directly west of Promontory Point. As he was flying at 357 knots, and the position data was at least 2 minutes old, were unsure of his actual position but knew it would be north of there. We instructed him to turn around and fly back to the confirmed coordinates to jettison the load. He agreed. At around 2110, Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}2 – told me that she thought the two jettison sites signs were mixed up, and that T-XYZ was actually headed to a jettison site called Rock Creek. She showed me AFF which put T-XYZ near the Tooele Army Depot, and showed me a map in CAD of the plotted coordinates of what was at 40 16.9833 x 112 28.4000. It was a chunk of BLM land east of the toe of the slope of the Onaqui Mountains, south of Highway 199, and West of the Tooele Army Depot. After looking at the spot, I was fairly certain that was not a jettison spot as I thought all three of ours were on Promontory Point, however I did not think we had enough time to get the pilot back up to the correct area to jettison before pumpkin time which was in about 12 or 13 minutes. I figured it was safer to have him jettison in the light in an inappropriate area, so that he could still see and avoid things that needed to be avoided, than to have him jettison in the dark and potentially endanger the lives of all pilots on board the aircraft, and possibly people on the ground. After he had moved away from the coordinates, the pilot confirmed that he had dropped his retardant at the given coordinates.

We then called Hermit Helibase to ask someone to stand out in the open as we flew overhead, in order to ascertain that the doors were actually stuck in a partially open position.  The person confirmed that the doors were part way open.     The pilot determined it was not an emergency and would not affect the aircraft's aerodynamics.  He reduced the airspeed and we completed the mission.  On landing at Jeffco Airport, further inspection by the pilot revealed a gear door hook was partially broken.  After talking to a company maintenance person, it was determined that the problem would not cause an unsafe flying condition and that the part would be replaced when the aircraft returns to it's maintenance base on July 28, 2002.

This immediately grabbed our attention and we continued with the drop as we had power out, were lined up, and needed to shed the weight anyway if we have a legitimate engine oil system failure. We made our run-out downhill and loaded the engine to see if an increased power requirement would bring the pressure back up to the normal range.

We completed rappel sequence and cargo let down operations and had an AAR on the events that unfolded. We talked about the intermittent “caution panel” caution light that is accompanied by the Master Caution light on the front dash. This light cannot be extinguished while illuminated because it means that the Caution Panel is INOP. The helicopter mechanic believes the light comes on due to a faulty relay. This led to a discussion that the Intermittent Caution Panel could cause a concern while in rappel operations.

254,19-0277,"During bucket operations on the XXX fire the long line became wrapped over the rear right skid of the helicopter. Hotshots Perspective: Hotshots were working helo in division alpha doing bucket drops. Helo returned from dip to hotshots and made a drop. After the drop hotshots returned to work and did not see anything wrong during the drop. They noted that the pilot had been doing good work, but the winds were a little squirrely with an upslope component. The also stated that Helo was droping 50 to 100 feet above canopy. After drop helo returned to alpha dip. Div-A perspective: Div-A was at a cabin adjacent to alpha dip with an engine. Helo was going back and forth between alpha dip and dropping water in XXX canyon. There was a middle ridge in between the dip and where the drops were taking place. Distance from dip to middle ridge was described as around mile. Div-A noted that he saw the helo near the middle ridge and the bucket appeared to be flying erratically but was pretty far away and he was looking through some canopy when he made the observation. The Helo then arrived at the dip and the bucket started to come down through canopy. As the bucket came down an Engine crewmember alerted division that the long line was over the skid. Div-A contacted helo and alerted pilot as bucket was entering water. Pilot asked if it was over the front or back and was told back. Pilot then lifted and appeared to be releasing water as he lifted. Pilot then returned to Helitack to get fixed. Engine Perspective: Engine was at alpha dip with Div- A, Engine noticed Helo flying to dip making S-turns on the approach. As helo came to the dip and started to lower bucket towards water they saw the long line was over the skid and notified division. Pilot Comment - I was supporting XXX Hot Shots with a 240gal bambi bucket on the XXX Fire 06/26/2019 at approximately 1200 local time. At drop {{{#}}}11 my ground contact asked for a trail drop about 400 feet higher on the ridge above the previous drops. I made the drop and climbed over the ridge and started my descent to the dip site. The dip site was relatively close and at a lower altitude. I flew some S-turns to slow my forward progress to allow more time to descend. I filled the bambi bucket at the dip site and as I picked the bucket up the helicopter gently rolled a little to the right. I lowered the bucket back into the pond and slowly picked it up again and the same gentle roll repeated. I released the water because I suspected the long line was hung up somewhere on the helicopter’s landing gear. The dip site manager confirmed my suspicion. I released the water and flew back to Heli-Spot 3. Upon landing it was discovered the long line was over the portion of the skid tube behind the aft cross tube. My helitack crew fixed the problem and I returned to supporting the hot shots. The thunderstorms that air attack briefed us on were starting to form and winds were moderate but manageable. During my S-Turn descent my air speed was between 30-40kts to minimize forward progress to allow more time to descend to the dip site. My turns where never more then 20 degrees each direction and control movements during the drops where never excessive. Manager comments – Helicopter launched from helibase at 10:40am for bucket work. Helicopter was configured for bucket operations at H-3. Longline and bucket configuration was correctly completed and all checks were made without incident. Helitack personnel were at H-3 when Div informed Helicopter XXX of longline issue. As soon as Div reported the issue the pilot released the water and flew to the helispot. The helicopter was landing at the helispot when we took some photos of the longline over the skid. The manager spoke with the pilot while HECM’s fixed the longline as well as inspected it for any damage. No damage was identified on the longline, bucket or aircraft. The pilot and manager discussed any concerns with the weather, dip site and bucket operations overall. Pilot stated everything was going well but the winds were “squirrely” do to outflow winds from a system building nearby. He and I felt comfortable returning back to bucket operations to finish the 20 minutes left on the fuel cycle, which was completed without incident. When we returned to helibase we called an AMI about any concerns he may have. AMI had no concerns. We re-inspected the longline and bucket, everything looked as it should and was in good working order. XXX had completed 11 drops without incident prior to longline over skid incident. Air Attack had reported feeling outflow winds shortly before the incident with the longline. The distance between the dipsite and dropping area was approximately 1 mile with a ridge line between the two. ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Four fires effectively merged into one which became a complex fire. 7/18/2014 In the morning, Air Attack noticed that a private company had taken independent action outside the TFRs on the fires southern perimeter with ground forces {crew, dozer,etc}. They had two helicopters supporting the private independent action outside the TFR. The helicopters did not have communications with fire team ATGS. The ATGS contacted Air Attack and it was decided that the ATGS would attempt contact with the private helicopters while Air Attack continued duties elsewhere on the now very large incident. The ATGS contacted them at the local airport and made arrangement for the forces to continue, as not being a factor to government supervised aircraft, as long as they were in communication on ATGS assigned Air to Air and Air to Ground Frequencies. Later that day at 1830, another TFR was put into place that covered the current fire and expected growth. The new TFR extended over the area the private crews were working. The private ships continued operation while the ATGS’s kept other incident aircraft separated from them. 7/19/2014 Private fire forces continued to take action as the day before, but now the TFR was in place that covered their operations where two private helicopters were working. Fire forces engaged the fire, specifically trying to protect a structure. The complex fire forces on the ground tried contacting the helicopters. The ATGS tried also. Neither helicopter communicated with the ATGS to ask permission to enter the TFR, nor did they communicate when asked to do so. All complex fire aviation forces were withdrawn from the area. Ground forces did not feel safe without agency air support so they also disengaged. The manager of the private company was contacted later in the day by the complex IC who explained the gravity of TFR violation and the effect of their forces on the planned action of the complex forces. The manager said his forces would comply with the communications, but would continue to take independent action with all his forces. 7/20/2014 Private forces continued action. The private company requested a change in the TFR so they could dry cherry orchards with predicted rain on 7/22 and fight fire. Private aircraft did comply with radio communications. Complex aviation assets were separated from their forces. 7/21/2014 Private forces continued action. Private aircraft did comply with radio communications.

268,02-1149,"Crew was alerted for a MAFFS mission to the Million Fire from Colorado Springs at 1500 local(mdt), after sitting on standby for the previous 3 days without flying.  This was the first fire mission for this crew, this season.  It was discovered in the pits, prior to launch, that the MAFFS unit dispensing tubes would not relock in the exended position once brought into the aircraft.  So the pilot decided to leave the tubes out and locked and fly to the fire unpressurized.  On the previous flight (deployment from Charlotte, NC to Co. Springs)an equipment malfunction code affecting the radar was discovered by the crew, which resolved itself well prior to reaching Co. Springs and showed no further indication of degradation.  Just prior to take off on the incident flight, the crew again had the equipment malfunctions code, and took off expecting to code to clear.  After takeoff the pilot climbed to 10,000 msg and visually cleared terrain crossing the first ridge southwest of Co. Springs and on across the valley that provided terrain clearance.  During this time the navigator was having increasing difficulty using the radar for terrain clearance.  The visibility was deteriorating but still well above VFR.  As the crew worked to clear the radar problem and plot position using GPS, the pilot was skirting high terrain on the left with lower terrain on the right.  The pilot attempted to cut across the end of a ridge extending from the terrain on the left to the valley on the right.  As the aircraft passed the extension of the ridge on the right he realized that he may be able to cross the saddle and went to maximum power and flaps 50%.  The flight engineer closed the engine bleed valves for maximum power.  After a few seconds the crew realized for sure they would not clear the saddle on the right and the pilot turned left up the canyon towards the last remaining option, a shallow saddle between two peeks.  The pilot directed emergency drop of the retardant load and flaps to 60%.  The copilot and loadmasters accomplished the drop and the copilot positioned the flaps to 60%.

270,03-1155,"At about 1730 hours, July 14, 2003, Coronado Initial Attack Dispatch called me to see if I was available to fly to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation to work on an initial attack fire, the Popcorn Incident.  I replied that I was, and acquired all the necessary information, including resource order numbers, frequencies, air and ground contacts, etc.  My pilot and I departed Tucson International Airport (TIA) at 1816, under partly cloudy, but threatening skies.  Airport weather indicated moderate to severe thunderstorms to the northeast and southeast of the airport. As we cleared the terrain to the north of Tucson, we began to receive radio traffic from the SCA aerial observer, P3, who was flying over the fire, and I called San Carlos Dispatch to let them know I was inbound to the Popcorn Fire, and approximate ete to the fire.  San Carlos Dispatch told me that P3 was over the fire and that he seemed to be having trouble transmitting over the assigned VHF frequency, 127.975. Between 1824 and 1857 hours, as we approached the fire area, P3 was attempting to talk to heavy air tanker, T55, SEATS 411 and 459, both flying out of the SEAT Base at Whiteriver, and me, on VHF 127.975.  As I got closer, it became apparent that the pilot who was flying P3 was in communication with T55, who was on scene, and that from the target description being given to T55, the P3 pilot intended to drop T55`s retardant load on the fire.  At 1850, T55 did drop his load on the fire.  When I got to within 12 nautical miles to the south of the fire, I called P3 on the victor frequency to seek permission to proceed to the fire.  As he had his hands full, he told me to stay where I was until he told me otherwise.  We went into an orbit around the east side of San Carlos Reservoir, and I noted that the air was extremely filled with smoke at that point.  We were orbiting at 9,500' and as we listened to the radio traffic, the overload on the observer was apparent.  At about that time, first he mentioned that two unidentified helicopters had gone through his airspace from the direction of Whiteriver, and a little later, he said that a news media helicopter had entered the airspace unannounced and without permission.By then, the two SEATS who had been working the fire were back in the airspace, and it didn't seem that either the pilot or observer of P3 had a firm grasp on the situation.  At this point, my pilot, whom I was flying with for the first time on 07/14/03, told me he felt very uncomfortable entering or proceeding into the airspace under the present escalating circumstances, so I called P3 and then San Carlos Dispatch and told them I thought they had an unsafe situation on their hands and that we were returning to Tucson.

279,04-0311,"Helibase Mgmt Comments: While working on the incident it was determined that multiple helibases would work better, one for each type of helicopter. There were new areas designated for the two new helibases. I was sent to help develop Blue helibase with several folks. We left the main helibase, Milan, with the impression that we were to get the helibase operational and then we would call back and have the ships sent over. The people running Milan Helibase were under the impression that they would send the ships out to do bucket work and after there fuel cycle would land at Blue Helibase. Before Blue helibase was operational helicopters started coming over to land. This came as a bit of a surprise to us working to get Blue Helibase ready since we did not know they were coming. The pad makers were laid out, but not all of the brush had been taken out of the safety circles. This was one of several things that were not ready when the helicopters started coming. Helicopter xxxx was one of the ships coming into land. The pilot was told to land on pad one and that a marsheller was heading out there. The marsheller got out there about the same time that xxxx was trying to set down his bucket. The marsheller moved out of the way and did not marshel the helicopter down. After the marsheller got out of the way and turned around he notice that the tail of xxxx was close to a bush near the edge of the safety circle. The pilot at this point was looking down as he was landing the ship. So the marsheller was not able to notify the pilot with hand signals. This was when the helicopter was almost down. After the pilot had shut down and got out he notice his tail was just above a juniper bush. At this point the bush was cut out. The helicopter''s mechanic looked at the tail rotor and told the Helicopter Manager that no damage had been done. At about 1330 after flying .8 of an hour it was realized, between the Mechanic and Helicopter Manager, that there had been a green smudge on the tail rotor. At this point the Helibase called Air Attack and had xxxx return to base and shut down. There are several lesson that have been learned. 1. The importance of positive communications 2. Clean all obstructions out of safety circles 3. If Parking Tenders are not giving hand signals they need to be able to communicate via radio with the pilots. Pilot Comments: After helibase radioed that they were ready for me to land, I made my approach into the wind to pad #1. Marshaller was in place. I set water bucket down between the marshaller and the pad marker.I decended down to a 10 ft. hover and looked ahead at the marshaller, he was not marshalling,only standing and watching. He gave no indication of any hazard. I looked down and continued to land. After shutdown, I exited the helicopter and saw a juniper bush under the tail roter. In addition to other contributing factors, such as the helibase not ready to recieve landing helicopters, and the marshaller not giving any hand signals. The landing saftey circle was clearly not adequate for this helicopter. At a minimum the approach and departure path should have been cleared of brush in accordance to the IHOG chapter 8. The 90ft saftey circle is not large enough.If the pad marker is in the middle of the saftey circle and a helicopter lands with the nose on the pad, the tail roter will be outside the saftey circle. I recommend that the IHOG be changed to provide an adequate safey circle. Also, after discussion with helibase manager, I was informed that they were told by the regional helicopter operations specialist, in region 3, that a marshaller was not required, and a parking tender was to be used.

I followed the helicopter on National Flight Following and when the helicopter got close to our forest boundary I advised the Air Attack of the presence of the helicopter.

During this time I was also on the phone with the other dispatch trying to get them to contact the helicopter.  Again, I was told that the aircraft dispatcher had contact with the helicopter.

319,02-0703,"At 1405 8 August, 2002, T-60 was dispatched to the in Sour Bisquitin fire. Our load was 2550 gallons of retardant and a full load of gas weighing 12,000 pounds. We departed Klamath Falls airort wihich was VFR, but the smoke was heavy in all quadrants. The temperature was in the mid 90's with an attendant high density altitude. Climb peformance was going to be poor as with all heavy piston powered aircraft. Translated, this means the climb rate was going to be marginal at times and fluctuating between zero and three hundred feet per minute for significant stretches of time. The tops of today's smoke layer varied between eitht and ten thousand feet. Obviously, quite a lengthy time is spent flying through this smoke in IFR conditions. When there's no way anyone can tell exactly what the visability is in the smoke, calling the visability acceptable, is a foolish game. Not only that, flying IFR without filing a flight plan, (totally unreasonable) is illegal. When I arrived over the coordinates given me in the dispatch, I was looking into a heavy layer of smoke below me. If the coordinates were a little off, that wasn't the problem. There was a heavy layer of smoke between me and the ground. The drop altitude was below 4000 feet. That was going to require me to descend 4000 feet through the smoke and hope there were no hills or other aircraft in my way. The odds are it could be done, and for that matter, has been done countless times. Where is the plane in front of me coming off his drop?. If I drop, where is the tanker coming in behind me? Sound sily? Think about it. Had I dropped my retardant load, the climb back to altitude would have been faster, but still in IFR conditions. What heading do I take to assure myself of missing the tallest peaks? Can I see them? Maybe. My decision was to stay at altitude(I actually climbed another 1000 feet to have somewhat better visability) and return to Klamath Falls loaded. Any tanker taking the same direct route between Klamath Falls and the fire would have to cope with the same visability problems. As it was, another tanker popped into view so close as to make the passing not much more than luck. The closing speed of two tankers doing 200 knots each is obviously abut 400 knots. Roughly figuring, that's about 700 feet per second closing rate. In the smoke, evasive actin would be moot. My decision was to abort the mission. We are constantly being told not to push a situation or take chances. The reluctance of pilots to follow this advice is evidenced all the time. The reason has as much to do with making money as with the inmachoin can do mentallity. The inSour Bisquitin fire is over 300,000 acres and drops I made days ago are now burried well inside the burn. We are called to drop upon lines where there is no visable ground support nor high priority ground to protect. We pilots are not blind, nor is this something new to behold. We are not building a fireproof wall with the retardant we drop. These few drops made before smoke shuts down the tanker opperation are not critical to the control of a monster fire. I'll gladly argue this point with anyone. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The ATS on board the aircraft was scheduled to return to his home duty station the next day and his vehicle was at the Fresno Airtanker Base. After conferring with dispatch, it was decided that we would recover to Fresno to facilitate getting the ATS to his vehicle for the return trip to Redding. After receiving the order to land at Fresno, I obtained the current weather for FAT. Due to drift smoke from fires in the bay area, the visibilities were varying at FAT and at the time of our arrival, they were were just below VFR minimums. I contacted approach control and requested an IFR clearance into Fresno. I received a clearance and approach began vectoring us for an ILS approach to runway 29R. I proceeded to set up the avionics and loaded the approach into the GPS````s. During this phase of the flight we had excellent ground contact/visibility and what appeared to be much greater than a few miles of forward visibility. After getting established on the inbound course I recognized that I did not have a glideslope indication. We were approaching the point at which we should begin to intercept the glideslope and begin the decent phase. While I was trying to figure out why the glidesope indication was missing I allowed my altitude to vary and began a decent. I still had good visual contact with the ground and was beginning to pick up the airport environment. The approach controller alerted me to my altitude being lower than it should have been for my location and i began to correct back to the proper altitude. While climbing back to the required altitude I realized I had bumped a required selector pad {on the gps touchscreen} one too many times which was the cause for the glideslope missing. I corrected the selection to VLOC and all indications were proper. We followed the approach with no further issue and landed on the selected runway. Shortly after we parked at the tanker base we were dispatched to a fire just southeast of the airport and the visibility had risen back to VFR and we departed under VFR conditions. After operating at the fire, the airport had dropped back just below VFR minimums and we requested another IFR approach clearance and completed that approach with no issues and it was end of the duty day when we parked at the base. I was remiss in not filing a safecom in a more timely manner and should have made formal notification to share my experience with the appropriate individuals.

352,08-0569,"A near miss occurred between a SEAT and a helicopter with a bucket on a 100 foot longline. The near miss occurred during the exit phase of the SEAT after dropping retardant along the left flank of the Gun Club Fire. Air Attack {Nxxxx}had just transitioned with the initial ATGS {Nxxxx}, the helicopters were supporting ground operations on the west and east ends of the left flank (north side). The fire was aligned west to east with a prevailing west to SW wind. Retardant operations were happening in the middle zone of the left flank. The each helicopter had their own water dip site, one was a ½ mile north of the left flank on the west end, and the orher was one mile south of the east end of the fire. During the air attack transition 2 SEAT drops were made, but the relief air attack did not see the south side helicopter make actual water drops in its’ area of work. Soon after the ATGS transition a third SEAT {T-xxx} arrived and was cleared into the FTA. The air attack intended to instruct both helicopters {Nxxxx & Nxxxx}to hold but evidently called twice to the north side helicopter {Nxxxx}. The south side helicopter {Nxxxx} pilot heard the calls and did not think the hold was for him because he thought the tanker ops would be on the west side of the fire. The air attack did not catch the mistaken hold call to the south side helicopter when the north side helicopter pilot replied to the second hold call that he had already said he was holding and had not recieved a hold confimation from the south side helicopter. The SEAT pilot had seen both helicopters during his arrival on scene depart the fire for the dip sites. When he heard the call for the helicopters to hold at the dip, he thought the line was clear. The air attack thought the line was clear and proceeded with the drop. There were no ground personnel in the drop area to clear. The SEAT {T-xxx} made the drop, flew through some smoke on the exit and encountered the helicopter {Nxxxx}.

354,10-0205,"We recently purchased two Red Dragon aerial ignition machines and had some issues when we used them for the first time. First, we installed the exit chute incorrectly so that the spheres could not drop out. We had placed one of the securing nuts on the inside instead of both being on the outside which caused the chute to be misaligned. Unfortunately we bench tested without the chute so were not aware of our mistake until the PSD operator experienced a jam. He attempted to clear it manually and noticed smoke coming from the machine. He immediately activated the emergency water system which extinguished the fire, and the helicopter returned to the helispot, where we discovered our mistake. After correcting our error the machine worked fine for a fuel cycle. During the next fuel cycle, however, the PSD operator experienced 3 jams in one chute. The first time, he was not able to clear the jam and the aircraft returned to the helibase where we were not able to duplicate or solve the jam. We were aware of the jamming issue caused by removing the hopper and then not removing the two spheres that block the chutes when this occurs: this was not what had occurred in this case. The aircraft returned to the unit where firing continued until he experienced two more jams in succession. He was able to manually clear both jams and complete ignition. Upon examining a random sample of Dragon Eggs, we discovered several spheres had a sharp, jagged piece of plastic protruding from the seam area. We had noticed a large number of shavings in the hopper and wondered if some of these protrusions broke off while the spheres were agitated in the hopper. We suspected that these hard plastic protrusions might be causing the eggs to jam in the chute.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thunderstorms began to encroach on the fire and the pilot informed air attack he needed to retrieve the crew and return to the helibase. After returning to the helibase, the pilot discovered the mgt gauge indicated that a mgt exceedance had occurred, 6 degrees for 37 seconds. The Diamond j mgt gauge does not confirm an exceedance has occurred until the aircraft is shut-down. After the crew had completed an AAR of the initial attack, the pilot notified the Manager/COR of the exceedance and that the aircraft was out of service until an inspection of the “hot section” of the engine could be performed. Notification of the exceedance occurred an hour after the aircraft had returned to the helibase. Pilot’s account of the incident: during the flight, I did notice that the mgt gauge flashed and then stop flashing. This can happen if the temperature reaches a warning point. Typically, the flash would be accompanied by an aural warning, however, the aircraft is not wired for the aural warning. If there is no exceedance, the gauge will then stop flashing once corrective action is taken. The gauge will also flash if an actual exceedance occurs, but then stops after a minute. Without the gauge flashing and without having seen the actual moment of exceedance, the next time the pilot has an indication is when the shuts down at the end of the flight the gauge starts to flash again. I’m assuming the exceedance occurred while drafting water or during climb out, and that I saw the last couple of flashes on the gauge. Weather started to get worse and I chose to stop water dropping ops and pick up the crew to return to helibase.  Once on the ground, I did confirm that an exceedance had occurred.

376,00-1048,On 5/13/00 Helicopter 210 was on a scheduled recon of the Outlet fire departing from the Grand Canyon NP South Rim helibase.  Upon launch Helo 210attempted to contact Outlet Air Attack on Victor 119.50 and 123.95 to no avail.  Helo 210 then landed @ North Rim Helibase until air attack could becontacted.  Air Attack then requested 210 remain on the ground @ North Rim HBuntil all airtankers over the fire were clear.  Helo 210 remained on the ground for 10-15 minutes.  At approximately 13:00 Air Attack cleared Helo 210 to launch for the fire recon.  Helicopter 210 requested to start a recon up the North Flank and clockwise around the fire perimeter returning to North Rim @ the end of the recon.  Air Attack approved the pattern and advised a Lama and a Lead 53were over the fire and there were no airtankers due for 10 minutes.Helicopter 210 proceeded up the North Flank at 500' AGL (8800 MSL).Helicopter 210 had a visual on the Lama who was making location calls in the blind while doing bucket work.  Helicopter 210 also sighted Lead 53 4-5 milesahead just as he flew into the smoke drift.  At that time the Lead 53 was traveling in the same direction (Northeast) as Helicopter 210.  Helo 210 proceeded up the North flank staying wide of the perimeter and the smoke. At approximately 13:10 Helicopter 210 pilot and manager sighted Lead 53 as it appeared out of the smoke approximately 1/4 mile to starboard at the same altitude as Helicopter 210 on a recipricol heading (Southwest).  Lead 53 banked left as he sighted Helicopter 210 and reported to Air attack that an unknown helicopter was in orbit over the fire.  Helicopter 210 identified itself as being the ship involved. Separation was estimated to be 1000' to 1/4 mile.Lead 53 pulled into an orbit out of the area as Helicopter 210 verified itsorbit altitude with Air Attack.  Air attack requested the helo remain at 500'AGL.  Helicopter 210 then requested to move to 1000' and was cleared to do so by Air Attack.  Helicopter 210 finished the recon and returned to North Rim Helibase at 1320.  At the time of the incident there were no airtankers in orbit over the fire.  Helicopter 210 was not notified that the Lead plane would be making low passesor dry runs on the North Flank.  From subsequent radio conversation on Victorit was apparent that the Lead plane was not aware of Helicopter 210's presenceor position on the fire.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
377,15-0472,"Air patrol departed the airport at 1326 in a Cessna 182 under contract with the US Forest Service. The aircraft contained agency carded pilot and an aerial observer. They were approximately 1.5 hours into the patrol flight when they heard a “pop” in the forward engine compartment. The engine began running roughly. The pilot adjusted engine controls and trim and then proceeded to diagnose the problem. Engine oil began to cover the front windscreen of the aircraft. The pilot issued a mayday call over the radio. The pilot and observer began to assess and discuss potential landing areas for emergency landing. They selected a pasture in river drainage as their best option and began a gliding descent. Engine oil continued to completely cover the windscreen while descending. They had sufficient altitude and airspeed for a single pass by the pasture to scan for hazards. They set up for a 180 degree approach turn to a landing heading and began to lose some airspeed and altitude A large tree in the center of the field was identified as an obstacle they would have to avoid. Winds were gusty and variable generally from the west.  The crew was not able to identify wind direction. They turned for final approach to the East,  and the wind was at their tail. The pilot added some remaining power to clear the tree and noticed a power line he needed to descend under to avoid it.  They cleared the tree and descended under the power line touching the ground just past the power line. They bounced upon impact. The front landing gear was torn off upon the second touchdown. They began to slide on the rear landing gear and nose of the airplane,  the right wing impacting the ground.

406,03-1274,"						August 2, 2003To Whom It May Concern:	This letter is written to document an event involving ground resources and an airtanker.	Recently, the Pagosa Ranger District endured a lightning bust, which caused multiple ignitions over a 3-4 day period.  Precipitation on the zone contributed to a low spread potential in the fine fuels, although there was, and still is, a high probability of ignition and spread component in the heavy fuels.   	As district personnel coordinated initial attack on multiple ignitions in the Ant Hill area, with the assistance of county and local fire district resources, air attack arrived on scene.  Air attack was dispatched by Durango Interagency Dispatch Center.  Radio traffic between Durango Dispatch, air attack, and ground personnel staffing fires made radio communication difficult.  At the time, District personnel, with the assistance of county and city resources, were initial attacking three fires, one of which was East Ant Hill, located on Forest Service land.  Neither district personnel nor ground resources ordered air attack, and district personnel only realized air attack was on scene after air attack arrived and indicated the fire location.	Initial attack personnel began working on the East Ant Hill fire and determined that a tree on fire had to be felled.  Coordination had been made with the local fire department, which was taking action on a nearby fire on private land.         As all of these events were occurring, and in addition to the district answering calls from the public and dispatching resources to other fires, we overheard air attack request a heavy air tanker.  No district or ground personnel, as we discovered later, had been contacted about the retardant drop.  The IC on the ground tried to call air attack on forest net and air-to-ground, with no success.  Fire staff in the office also tried to contact air attack on forest net, with no success.  We were trying to determine air attack’s intentions, all the while trying to coordinate efforts elsewhere.During this activity, the sawyer on the East Ant Hill fire had placed a face cut on his tree, and began his back cut.  The sawyer felled the tree and began bucking up the top portion of the tree, which was on fire.  The remainder of the IA squad was clear of the felling operation, but started back to assist the feller after the tree was on the ground.  These personnel saw the sawyer drop his saw on the ground and begin to run from the area.  He commented to me that “After dropping the tree, which was on a knoll surrounded by flatter ground, he looked up and saw, at eye level, an air tanker coming in on him so he ran out of the way”.  Apparently, the air tanker pilot saw the tree fall and was able to abort the drop, even though he was on low-level approach.  If the drop had occurred minutes/seconds earlier, the pilot would not have seen the sawyer under the tree.  With the tree already being cut, the retardant drop could have caused the tree to fall in a direction other than the intended lay, which could have caused serious injury, or worse, to the sawyer and/or other crewmembers.  Later, it was determined that part of the retardant drop was intended for a fire on private land, which consisted of a burning fence post.  The local fire department did not want retardant applied on private land.  The other target was the East Ant Hill fire.  However, the IC was not aware that retardant would be dropped on this fire. The following day, immediate action was taken by the Forest and District FMO.  A detailed, formal After Action Review is planned.  Issues that need to be addressed include;1.   The forest radio system easily becoming overloaded with traffic, and poor performance of the radio system overall, especially during inclement weather.2.	Personnel not directly working local fires saturating the forest net with conversation.3.	Air resources arriving on scene and executing actions without first contacting ground forces or district fire staff.4.	Multiple decision makers, both in the air and at Durango Dispatch Center, who are unaware of local weather, a fire’s resistance to control efforts, resources in the local area, or local coordination with private landowners and local fire departments.5.	Lack of adherence to LCES.  If communication is not established with ground resources, or at a minimum with district fire staff, all actions should cease.

415,13-0702,"Near mid-air report: 7 August, time 1855, left downwind runway 35 at 1,000 feet AGL, at the Airport.  Aircraft involved were Lead “A” and Air Attack “B” both working fires near the airport.  Estimated near miss separation distance was 100 to 200feet.  Narrative: There were two Initial Attack fires in close proximity - Fire “AA”, less than 1 Nautical Mile {NM} east of the Airport using 2 SEATs, 1 T2 Helicopter, 2 State DC-7’s, with Aerial Support provided by Lead “A” and Air Attack “A”.  The second Fire “BB” was 7 NM northwest of the Airport using 1 SEAT, 3 Heavy Air-tankers with Aerial Support provided by Lead “B” and Air Attack “B”.  Each Fire Traffic Area {FTA} had its own distinct Air-Air VHF frequency assigned.  Additional “non-players” to the FTA and airport traffic pattern, at about the time of incident, were a medevac helicopter {Life-Link} enroute to the hospital and an unannounced Type1 Helicopter prepositioning to the airport.  The FTA pattern for Fire AA was exactly coincident with a left traffic pattern for runway 35 at the airport.  Both Leads A and B were periodically monitoring each respective VHF frequencies.  Lead B coordinated with Lead A on how to sequence Fire BB’s SEAT aircraft into the airport traffic pattern to Load retardant and Return to the fire.  Lead A directed a standard Left downwind entry to runway 35 at or below 4,300 feet: which was 500feet below the flight pattern Lead A was flying on Fire AA.  This was working well with the SEAT from Fire BB.  At approximately 1845 Air Attack B left Fire BB for a fuel stop at the airport. He flew 10 NW to the west of the airport and turned back east to set up for landing.  Air Attack B contacted Air Attack A to advise of intentions to enter Fire AA’s FTA and land at the airport.  Air Attack A acknowledged that Air Attack B was inbound for the airport to get fuel.  There was no acknowledgement from Air Attack B that he had received the transmission from Air Attack A.  At that time Air Attack A was sending the acknowledgement, Air Attack B was picking up the call from the inbound Life-Link on Unicom and was concerned for his safety inbound to Fire AA’s FTA.  Radio traffic was very heavy at the time. Air Attack A assumed that Air Attack B would switch to Unicom and that all aircraft were monitoring that frequency.  Lead A was unaware Air Attack B was inbound for fuel because he was monitoring both FTA VHF frequencies and not Unicom.  In hindsight, the communication loop was not completely closed between the two Air Attacks: however Air Attack B switched over to Unicom and announced intentions to join the airport traffic pattern.  At approximately 1855 both Lead A and Air Attack B unknowingly converged and saw each other in very close proximity on a Left downwind for runway 35 at 4,700-4,800 MSL.  It was the classic high wing below and low wing above pass over where both aircraft took evasive action. Both pilots in Lead A do not recall getting a separate TCAS advisory on Air Attack B.  There were many aircraft actively running on the ground at the airport resulting in the TCAS screen being flooded with overlapping symbology.

When we arrived on scene Air Attack was over head and briefed us that the Scoopers X and Y were also working in the same area and that H-XXX a CH-47 would be joining us.  He briefed us about the Scoopers flight path, their check points, as well as the dip site (Castaic Lake) and the check point (Wires Check) we would be using.  We had flown in Div A several times and were familiar with the routes and checkpoints.  After several drops working with the Scoopers and helicopter, air attack announced that he would be departing and that it would be 10-15 minutes before the replacement air attack got on station.  The outgoing air attack checked with the scoopers and both helicopters working in Div A about their comfort level working together without air attack overhead.  All were ok with it and continued operating.  The outgoing air attack had mentioned he had an inbound tanker but the tanker was instructed to hold until the new air attack got into place and the new air attack would direct the tanker.  
We made a couple drops and we had noticed the tanker holding above the fire.  Inbound to the drop when we announced “Wires Check” I noticed the tankers holding pattern had shifted slightly.  We continued inbound and tried to raise air attack.  We got no response from air attack and started to turn out from the area checking the tankers flight path.  The Tanker began turning in our direction and we noticed on our ADS-B traffic display that the tanker was descending and coming in over the top of us.  We continued our altered flight path and watched the tanker continue onto the drop in the same vicinity that we had been dropping water.  A few moments later being downwind of the flight path we encountered the wake turbulence from the tanker.  We again tried to reach air attack but weren’t able to make contact.  
Checking that the area was clear we continued to the drop and returned to the dip site.  We notified the scoopers and H-XXX to be on the look out and that we had a tanker drop nearby that was unannounced.  After getting another bucket and checking in at the “Wire Check” we were finally able to reach air attack and he briefed us that he had another tanker on the drop and to hold.
We briefed the air attack that the previous tanker was brought in without our knowledge and we needed positive communication if tankers were going to be working in the same area.  He responded that we had stepped on him when he made the call.
The new air attack had mentioned several times over the radio that this was his first time on the fire, he did not get a good transition, and had got a late dispatch to the incident.  
The only instruction we got from air attack was to stay at our below 5000 ft.  
Helicopters operate low to the ground especially in the dip sites and can’t always receive radio transmissions in the low canyon dip sites.  Air Attack may have made a call for us to hold at the Wires Check but we didn’t receive it.  Hold instructions need to be confirmed by the aircraft required to hold.

The fuel truck driver using a measuring stick and fuel logs as a guide assumed that the fuel truck could receive 1800 gallons of fuel and failed to visually verify that the amount of fuel entering the tank was within the tank’s capacity. As a result, the 2500-gallon capacity of the fuel truck was exceeded resulting in an overflow of fuel out the top port of the fuel tank. The fuel truck driver immediately reversed flow on the pump and placed absorbent towels on the spill {area 10ft x 15ft}, cleaning as much material as possible off the gravel surface of the roadway. All contaminated material was collected by the fuel tender, placed in a hazmat container and brought back to the fueling facility for disposal. The fuel truck driver then returned to duty without notifying the helicopter manager or Helibase Manager {HEB2}.

No damage to the bucket, wires or any broken branches in the trees.   Pad 6 was the western most landing spot on the helibase, next closest helicopter on the ground was over 350 yards away. I talked to the pilots:  They had just come on to relieve a crew that day.  XXXX had many hours in 61's and I had worked with him in tough areas without incident during the 2002 fire season.  XXXXXXXXXX was new to 61's and XXXX told me he was allowing XXXXXX fly at the time.  XX said he would fly in and out in the future and use the bubble windshield that would enable better reference.  I said I would more closely monitor take off and landings, and be ready to call if I saw anything.  I was on the fire and worked with them for the next several days and they flew with percision and skill the entire time.     ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
485,99-0201,"During bucket deployment training, a quarter inch (1/4) hole was noticed in the fuselage.  The hole is located on the rightside, 9 1/2 inches forward from the edge of the rear step, at the base of the fuselage curvature.  The Pre-use inspection  did not reveal the damage (hole).  An examination of the hole and what previous helicopter activities occurred prior to the hole discovery, indicated the damage may have occured during rappel recurrency.  The thumbscrew allenhead on the Sky Genie matches the diameter of the hole.  Various mockup simulations failed to indicate any situation that could indisputably be determined to have caused the damage.  It is theorized that the damage may possibly be attributed to one of the following actions:1) Approaching the aircraft with rope bag with genie on top, the bag was swung into the fuselage with enough force to cause the damage.2) Genie struck side of ship if rappeller swung unnaturally beneath ship.The damage is basically cosmetic, and the contractor has sealed it with tape temporaily, and will do a permanent fix at he first opportunity.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

After removing the tone from the air-to-ground frequency, Air Attack successfully communicated with the XXX Helitack crew which had already engaged in the suppression of the fire. It is critical that suppression resources ensure that they use the assigned frequencies for an incident. Without ensuring positive communication with all aircraft on the assigned frequency {including the Tx Tone}, the helitack crew should not have actively engaged in suppression action on the fire: air attack was not able to communicate with them in the event of an emergency or critical change in fire behavior.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our concerns were that the fire was between 10,000 and 11,000 feet and it had been burning for approximately three weeks and was essentially unstaffed with the exception of some helitack that had been pulled off the fire that morning but had been unable to be picked up due to high winds which are common on the xxxx. The forecast for the day included a red flag condition for high winds up to 50 plus mph. We were then given a mission to do bucket work after briefing at around 1000 hours. Both myself and the pilot were reluctant to take the mission and talked about the many concerns we had and decided the risks far outwayed any benefit.

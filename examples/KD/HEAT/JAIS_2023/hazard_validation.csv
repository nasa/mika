8,16-0441,"We were dispatched to the xxx fire in an ASM configuration. After speaking to the IC and IC{T} to determine and sync objectives, strategies, and tactics we discussed the needed tools to achieve the objectives of perimeter control {Full Suppression} with the IC and IC {T}. The fire was burning during peak burn period, in a high elevation mixed conifer fuel type with a moderate to heavy dead and down component, low to moderate rate of spread {3-5 Ch/Hr}, moderate surface fire flame lengths {2-4 ft}, isolated to group torching {occurring every 4-5 minutes}, Primary residences in the vicinity {within 1 mile}, a State Highway within 1/2 mile, a small community within 2-3 miles, and a high resistance to control due to access and fuel type {bug kill in the area}. The dew point at KXXX was -2c indicating a dry air mass in the area. The following aircraft were recommended to the IC and IC {T} based on conditions, fire activity, time to complete the retardant line, etc: 2 additional SEATS {Total of 4}, 2 Large Air Tankers, and a VLAT. We determined that based on load and return times, anticipated lag time in getting aerial assets on scene, it would take 2 SEAT loads across the heel, 8 loads per flank {16 SEAT loads total}, and an undetermined number across the head depending on timing of aircraft. To reduce cumulative transference of risk to the flight crews, increase efficiency, increase probability of success , and allow for all aircraft to be made available in a short time period we made the decision to order the VLAT with the concurrence of the IC and IC {T}. We were fully anticipating needing to double the loads needed by the time the aircraft arrived on scene. The order was placed thru the appropriate dispatch center for all aircraft and we began to work the fire to achieve objectives. We had a very candid discussion with the IC and IC{T} that if we do not get the aircraft needed we need to revisit ``the plan`` as without the needed tools we would not be able to successfully meet the objectives and there for not expose the flight crews to a loosing proposition. Approximately 1 hour after beginning retardant operations we were informed that per the Duty Officer {DO}the VLAT has been canceled. We discussed the issue with the IC and IC{T} and informed them of the fire activity, shifting winds, doubling of fire size, load and return times, cost of retardant delivered by the VLAT, and attempted to give them the information they would need to discuss with their Duty Officer. They made a few phone calls and informed us that the DO wanted some time to think about it. We informed the IC that the retardant operation would be halted until a decision could be made and offered our assistance to the ground fire fighters. During these discussions the fire activity picked up and the fire again doubled in size and began to spot short range {3-4 ch}. Due to the unnecessary delay and limitation of tools we were being allowed to utilize we began to suspended air operations and returned to KXXX for fuel. Also, during this time the winds on the fire switched 180 degrees, exhibited signs of high atmospheric instability {Rotors and whirls from the column} and the fire began to out flank our retardant line and move toward H2 which was staffed with unburned fuel between them and the main fire. Based on the lack of support and winds we halted operations to reduce exposure to ourselves and the other flight crews and recommended that the crews on H2 reassess their LCES and consider hiking off the hill. Once on the ground we made contact with the IC and they were quite frustrated and apologetic, I told them that I understand it was not their issue and we would help them in anyway we could, both the IC and IC {T} were very appreciative. While on the ground at KXXX the fire activity again picked up and a moderate to well developed column developed on the left shoulder, visible from KXXX, we were contacted by dispatch that the IC needed us over the fire ASAP. We launched within 6 minutes and were on scene. As an aircrew, it is neither appropriate or acceptable to limit what tools an IHC crew can use to construct line, we provide them with task, purpose, and an end state and allow the professionals to make the determination on how to achieve it. The reverse should be true from the ground to the air. Cost shall not be the sole determining factor when deciding what ``tool`` to use to meet the stated objectives. As a result of the above listed factors we halted aviation operations due to an unacceptable level of attempted risk transference and changing conditions.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

13,20-0966,"     On August 20, 2020 at 15:20 hours, Guard copter 802 hit it’s water bucket on a tree during a water dropping mission for the Butte Lightning Complex.  Guard copter 802 is a CH-47 with a 120’ longline attached to the bucket. The Lat/Long for the Cow Dip site is N 39 59.33 W 121 27.06.  We made contact with a tree while exiting a dip.  We were supporting fire “1-2”.  This was the second “dip” on a new fuel cycle.  Guard 802 had previously pulled 9 buckets from the this dip site on our first fuel cycle. 

The dip site is at an elevation of 6,200’.  The temperature was approximately 29 degrees.  Our speed over ground was 10 knots thus not into effective translational lift (ETL).  The bucket is a 2,000 gallon Tarantula Power-Fill Bambi bucket but was only 75% full.  We utilized the same exit path for departure from the pond each time.  The crew did not see the “snag” tree in time to jettison the water from the bucket and the bucket made contact with the top of the tree and tore a hole in the side of the bucket.  After briefing with the crew, it was determined/agreed that we did not climb enough altitude (AGL) prior to forward flight.  The tear is too large to patch and therefore out of service.  The crew of 802 did not feel anything in the aircraft when we struck the tree.  There was no other damage related to this incident.

One area identified operations at high density altitudes without performance charts as a hazardous activity.  The RASM Council recommended that SEATs not be used where performance data does not exist and forwarded this issue to the RAO Council.  The RAO Council made the following recommendations;•	Terrain elevation in the drop area is sometimes unknown on the initial response therefore, an estimate should be provided to the pilot on the dispatch order to allow computation of the allowable load. •	Pilots should be able to determine that a positive rate of climb (50 feet per minute) can be achieved on take off and to an altitude 1000 feet above the expected drop location at the response weight.•	Aircraft without performance information available to meet the contract requirement in B2.4.5 will not be allowed to operate on lands under FS protection.It appears these recommendations are not being followed at John Day.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Upon closer inspection, damage to the bucket include: two bent support ribs, ripped suspension straps, and a six inch tear in the top of the bucket wall. The heliwell used is an in ground, fiberglass, 1500 gallon tank. The fitting on the tank included a double female on the external side and a male/female adapter that extended two inches into the tank.

For the past several days, and the previous two cycles of the day, the Air Attack had been running the helicopters and SEATs on the rotor victor...due to the long turn around times this seemed to be working well for everyone, with the Air Attack sequencing all the aircraft together as needed. Before our last cycle, there was an Air Attack transition to a new Air Attack that apparently was not aware that everyone had been working on the same frequency...We had heard that SEATs were coming to the same area again, but were never told when they would be there. Our first drop went just fine, and during the long turn around to the dip, we never heard from Air Attack that SEATs were on station. On our second drop, during which we were talking to a ground contact and flying in smokey conditions while trying to find the drop point, we still hadn’t heard anything, so we went ahead and dropped planning on exiting off our nose and around the smoke as we had done previously. As I sat up after the drop, my copilot pointed out a previously unseen SEAT at our altitude, on our exit path, having just made a drop. I immediately turned 180 degrees away from the area and proceeded back around the column the other way. I was finally able to reach Air Attack, and he said “, Yea, he was talking to the SEAT, and the pilot could see me” and he tried to reach me on the rotor victor but I was talking to the ground, so he just went ahead and sent the SEAT in...We were monitoring the victor the whole time and at no time did we hear the Air Attack try to contact us about the SEAT. At this point, due to the lack of communication and getting no further responses from the Air Attack we decided it would be best to just depart the area and return to the Helibase. We never were able to reach Air Attack again, on the 10 mile trip back to Oasis Helibase to even tell him we that were returning to base.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

43,06-0615,"On July 8th, 2006 at aprox 1450 hrs, Central Nevada Dispatch called and informed us that T-xxx, a severity SEAT based at the Severity SEAT Base, was inbound for a load/return to the fire. Dispatch informed us that this SEAT was loaded with foam and had been unable to locate the fire and now was low on fuel and needed to jettison the load and land at BAM to refuel and reload with retardant. This aircraft (and regular Pilot) had initially been into BAM AAB and received an aircraft and vehicle use inspection and pilot briefing per Interagency policy. Prior to this aircraft’s arrival at BAM on 7/8, He was observed on AFF flying to a couple of locations quite a ways from each other. The Base Mgr. called Dispatch back to determine the true nature of T-xxx’s mission. It was then learned that T-xxx had in fact been dispatched to a fire and had been the unfortunate victim of a WILDCAD mix-up and was vainly searching an area, far from the true location of the fire, long enough he was now low on fuel. The Base then unsuccessfully attempted to contact T-xxx on the National Air Tanker Base Freq of 123.975 in order to relay the Jettison Area lat/long. A quick check of AFF found him just ESE of the airport, the base staff continued to attempt to contact him and was just about to call him on the District FM freq when he was observed jettisoning his load at the mouth of Hilltop Canyon. As this is a seasonal waterway and not the approved jettison area the Base Mgr. called the Severity Seat Base and spoke with the SEMG who said the pilot was a level II relief pilot, not the regular pilot, and had in fact been briefed, as per policy, but had never been in to BAM. (Also learned in later conversation with the pilot was the fact that he had only performed aprox 20 actual fire drops in his career and was a little apprehensive about his performance. This would factor in to the reason the Base Mgr. chose to discuss the intended mission with the Smokejumper spotter.) Interagency policy states that the first time during the season a tanker pilot arrives at a Large Tanker Base he will shut down his aircraft and receive a briefing from the base staff. This was the main reason this aircraft was shut down and the pilot given a briefing. Several other factors were starting to point to the need to ensure this pilot got a thorough Base briefing. A quick list of those factors were: No contact on the National Tanker Base frequency 123.975, either when inbound or on the ground; No knowledge of our jettison procedures or location; (ie; not dropping over waterways, lakes, etc…) No knowledge of BAM Ramp Procedures; Confusion surrounding the actual location of the fire. During the time that T-xxx was getting fueled the Base Mgr. was in contact with Dispatch to determine the correct lat/long, later confirmed with the pilot. While in contact with Dispatch, he also learned that a load of jumpers had been unable to jump the same fire due to erratic winds over the jump site, and that the jumpship was also inbound for fuel and would then be headed back to the Bone Fire to staff it. The Base Mgr. decided that this was a good opportunity to touch base with the jumpship spotter, who had ordered the SEAT, and really nail down the plan for the retardant mission for the new pilot, as well as discuss the winds encountered over the fire. This was accomplished and T-xxx was returned to the retardant rotation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

49,17-0457,"Retardant crew was loading a P2V airtanker in pit 2 when a SEAT came into pit 1 for hot load. The crew began loading the SEAT using the SEAT loading pump. This left one MXMS at the meter stand watching two meter displays while the other MXMS ran the engine driven SEAT pump. In the middle of both loading operations the retardant density on the SEAT meter suddenly increased and loading became sluggish. At nearly the same time the loader on the P2V announced that loading was sluggish as it appeared that the pump kept quitting. The MXMS at the meter tried to discover why there seemed to be an obstruction to the water flow and tried working valves etc. There seemed to be some confusion about why both loading operations were experiencing problems so the base manager radioed to the MXMS to discontinue loading the P2V and concentrate on what was wrong with the SEAT operation. All attempts to regain water by valve switching proved ineffective and the SEAT load was discontinued at 6875 lbs by the meter although visually short of a load. The SEAT then returned to the fire. Loading the P2V was restarted and without the noise of the running SEAT it was obvious now that the main pump was indeed running but experiencing the same sluggishness with an apparent loss of water. The tank light system immediately indicated with a red light that 2082 was reached and the loader stopped the pump. An aircrew member told the loader to “ignore the lights” and continue loading. The pump was restarted but still producing little flow and elevated density at the meter. So loading was discontinued at 18,065 lbs at the meter while the aircrew indicated full load had not been reached. The P2V returned to the fire. After both aircraft had left the base it was discovered that the water supply valve had not been open and the water tank had run dry. The valve was opened and the water tank began to recover. When the SEAT returned to reload, the SEAT loading pump would not recover a prime against the check valves and a decision was made in conference with the pilot to load using the main pump as it would have enough “pull” to recover a flow. This worked and the SEAT load was finished in specification and without problem using the main loading pump.

82,07-0158,"During PSD operations, a couple of issues arose will on an Rx Burn on the Angelina N.F. The first issue was during a 2 hour fuel cycle of firing operations. The PLDO had to be prompted by both the pilot and the Ignitions specialist to verify that he had complied with the orders of the ignitions specialist, such as, “ready to start: start firing # chutes and speed: and to stop firing. The PLDO had to be prompted to reply back the orders given so the ignition specialist knew when the machine was firing and when it was cleared. Also sometime during this same flight the PLDO vomited into the hopper of the psd machine and did not tell anyone. The pilot had viewed thru his cargo mirror that something else was coming out of the chute of the psd machine, but didn’t know what it was. He asked the PLDO, ''What is going on with the (psd) machine?'' The PLDO didn’t respond. The pilot repeated the question, the PLDO this time didn’t respond with a realistic answer. When asked again, the PLDO then said he was “putting some water thru the machine”. The machine appeared to be working properly as the pilot could still see the spheres dropping and he decided they could finish ignitions. The PLDO didn’t inform anyone of the situation until they had landed back at the helispot. The pilot later informed me (HELM), that for a second that he thought it might have been smoke or something coming out of the chute, but with nothing being reported by the PLDO of a malfunction or jam he continued with operations. My concern is that no matter what the situation is or how embarrassing it may be, the pilot and aircrew need to be informed. The pilot has many responsibilities and needs to be paying attention to flying the helicopter. If the pilots'' attention is directed at something else rather than flying the aircraft, something is wrong. Here the pilot is trying to decipher confusing information that should have been clear and concise, which took away from the pilot’s concentration of flying that aircraft in a flight profile that is low and slow, even if it only was for a few moments. Finally, if the PLDO is getting sick than they are not functioning at 100%. If their attention isn’t on the psd machine and the firing operations.

95,03-1365,"Aerial Ignition (Helitorch) After Action ReviewCrazy Horse Fire – MT-FNF-0092 - September 03, 2003 On August 30 & 31, Chrisman’s IMT prepared a tactical assessment of Hemlock Creek drainage and confinement options for the Crazy Horse Fire.  The selected alternative set trigger points to implement an aerial ignition (helitorch) burn-out operation west of Hemlock Lake and at the head of Red Butte Creek (perhaps as soon as September 01).  This tactic was selected as a low risk, low cost means to secure the fire from burning across the ridge into the Crazy Horse or Elk Creek drainages by spotting or surface fire. Helitorch ignition was selected to ignite relatively sparse, heavy fuels when ignited.  The pre-determined trigger point necessitating a burn-out was reached August 31, when the fire passed west of Hemlock Lake. The following discusses the operational and safety components of the action, and captures the critical elements of the After Action Review held on September 2, 2003.PlanningCritical elements of the Aerial Ignition Plan included:·	Preposition resources to implement the aerial ignition plan (Complex Prescribed Fire Burn Boss (RXB1), helitorch, Type III helicopter and module).·	Preposition air resources to use water drops to control flare-ups or spots across the ridge (Type I and II helicopters).·	Discrete communications channel would be assigned to facilitate ‘Air to Ground’ (helitorch platform to helitorch base; Burn-boss air platform, helitorch base, and Division); and helitorch ‘Deck’. ·	The Plan was focused on establishing a fire perimeter in Hemlock drainage that could be held with subsequent helicopter water drops.  Firing was also planned in Red Butte drainage to strengthen the hand ignition done there on August 29 and 30.Implementation – Monday, September 1, 20030700 – Daily operations briefing at ICP, which included notification that the helitorch operation would be conducted this operational period.0715 - Daily operations briefing at helibase, which included notification that the helitorch operation would be conducted this operational period.0830 – Helitorch Manager and Prescribed Fire Burn Boss briefing at helibase to all aerial ignition personnel; assigned discrete radio frequency confirmed/cloned/operational.1015 – Helitorch Manager briefing with helitorch staff, helitorch pilot, IC, OSCs, and Safety Officer at Helitorch Base (DP 8).1145 – Helitorch Manager and Parking Tender brief helitorch pilot.1210 – Operations and Prescribed Fire Burn Boss flies with 16K pilot for orientation and recon of the ignition patterns and sequence of firing. 1225 – Commence burning operation in Hemlock Creek, Operations Colla and Burn Boss Orton in Helicopter NXXXX, Flathead National Forest Lama which is the observation platform.  Helicopter NXXXXX, a Bell 206-L3, is the helitorch platform.Outcomes1)	An Aerial Ignition Plan was prepared and approved by the Forest Aviation Officer. 2)	Operational and safety briefings were conducted by Prescribed Fire Burn Boss and the helibase manager and by Div Z supervisor at H5.3)	During the recon flight, the proposed burn areas in Division’s A and Z  weresurveyed for personnel that could be threatened by the operation. Line personnel were not a factor in Div A since it was unstaffed that day. The ignition sequence and pattern was determined jointly by the Prescribed Fire Burn Boss and OSC, and identified to the ignition pilot during the recon flight. 4)	Div Z was staffed on that day with instructions on the IAP of:  “7. Control Operations. Continue to secure and mop up ridgeline to DIV Y break.  Portions of the division may be ignited per the Aerial Ignition Plan.” And“8. Special Instructions.  “…Operations will coordinate burn out with FBAN and Safety. . . . Notify adjacent Divisions prior to initiating the burn out.”Fireline personnel that were observed from the air appeared to be clear of the ignition area.5)	Personnel assigned to the helitorch operation were verified by AOBD and a Safety Officer as certified for their role. The helicopter pilot and all operational personnel met agency certifications and approvals for their respective positions.6)	During helicopter operations, the pilot, helicopter manager and Prescribed Fire Burn Boss are responsible for following all operational and safety rules. Operational, alternate and emergency helispots were also identified prior to operation implementation.7)	Burn-out and operational objectives were accomplished successfully.  These actions will potentially secure the fire in both the Red Butte and Hemlock drainages that will facilitate containing the west flank of the fire.  Issuesa)	Daily helibase debriefing at 1930 on September 1 and the September 2 After Action Review revealed:·	An unexpected short-burst ignition or residual hanging gel from the helitorch occurred within  a reported 50 to 60 feet of some of the helitack crew in Division Zulu.  This was within their assigned work area.  ·	Conflicting crewmember statements indicate that others of the crew may have been outside their designated area at the time helitorch ignitions were preparing to commence.  L&C Hotshot Superintendent reported some helitack crewmembers well downslope of their designated area. Instructions in the IAP were: “7. Control Operations. Continue to secure and mop up ridgeline to DIV Y break.”  Personnel had been specifically told by DIV Z to mop up one chain (66 feet) from the ridgeline. ·	Ground Spot weather observations recorded winds at 30 mph for approximately 1 minute when helitorch operations were underway (30 mph winds pushes limits for a Type 3 helicopter such as the L3 Jet Ranger).  Further conversation later between the AOBD and the helitorch pilot indicated the pilot was comfortable with the helitorch weight and the occasional wind effects on the flight characteristics of this helicopter.  He stated: “I would not have hesitated in the least to shut down the operation if I had felt at any time that I was outside either my comfort level or the capabilities of the helicopter.”·	Communications from Operations in the Lama observation platform (NXXXX) to Division Zulu were initially garbled due to wind in the cockpit (the Lama was flying with its doors off).  Helitack crew stated they did not receive clear communications from Division Z that the firing operation was to commence in DIVS Zulu. The Lewis and Clark IHC crew who were assigned to Zulu stated they were well-advised.·	There was significant traffic on the discrete air to ground channel (9) such that the Helitack Crew Boss quit scanning air to ground to pick up the tactical and command traffic.   In the AAR, it was determined that the assigned Air-to-Air frequency 120.675 was not used between the OSC/Burn Boss in NXXXX and the helitorch pilot in NXXXXX.  They instead used the discrete Air/Ground frequency of 165.825, contributing to the congestion on the discrete air-ground frequency.b)	At least one over-flight of personnel on the fireline with helitorch (unlit) during ignition period occurred. This may have been due to the pilot dealing with the wind along and just below the ridge while setting up to make a run into the canyon below.c)	Additional personnel working in the Division (five person Helitack Crew) were not identified or accounted for in the Incident Action Plan.  This crew was briefed at the Helibase, but did not attend the general briefing where it was clearly stated that burning would be implemented in both Hemlock and Red Butte drainages if conditions allowed.  These resources were known to and requested by the Division Supervisor and briefed with the other Crew at the Divisional briefing.  At this briefing they were informed of the probable burn out of Division Zulu.d)	Division informed personnel that the helitorch was incoming, but there were conflicting statements about when this notification occurred. All Division personnel were instructed by Division to be within one chain of the ridge at the Division briefing in the morning. Division believed all personnel were operating per instructions but did not specifically confirm that all personnel were clear of the ignition operation.e)	Prior to ignition in the second operational area, a dry run was conducted by the Burn Boss and OSC in the Lama and helitorch pilot and witnessed by Division personnel, although there are conflicting statements about whether all ground personnel (e.g., the 5-person helitack crew) witnessed the dry run before ignition.f)	Concerns for wind effects on helicopter flight were neither noted nor addressed during mid-ignition helitorch operations. (Further conversation between AOBD and the helitorch pilot indicated the pilot was comfortable with the capability of the Bell 206 LR3 to carry the helitorch weight and with the occasional wind effects on the flight characteristics of this helicopter.  g)	The pilot also indicated he had checked the helitorch over the hard black and that it worked “pretty darn good.”  The pilot further stated that he had checked the torch for residual gel prior to transiting from Div A to Div Z and that it was clean. He also stated that he did not knowingly test fire or otherwise activate the helitorch on his first approach into the head of Red Butte Creek near the helitack crew.  h)	Neither the  Helitack Crewmembers nor their supervisor in proximity to the short burst reported the incident to their crew boss until later in the afternoon, and the incident did not surface outside the crew until 1930 at the helibase debriefing.

He stated that it was unprofessional and unwarranted.  He stated that he didn't know how much experience I had in fire or aviation, but that I should know enough to know that his position in itself is enough to validate any flight without question.  He stated that as inOperationsin, if he orders it, then it's necessary.  I replied that in the performance of my job, it is my duty to all passengers as well as the pilot to do a risk analysis of each mission, and part of that analysis is asking questions to ensure there is not a more appropriate ground alternative to the flight.  I stated that it's in our policy to ask inIs this flight necessary?in  inHave ground alternatives been considered?in  inAre all passengers necessary to the mission?in  I stated with this year's increased accident occurrence, I was even more scrutinizing of every mission to ensure a safe flight for everyone.

137,08-0382,"At approximately 2030 hrs on 6/23/08,during initial attack of the Piedra fire {CO-SUA}, one of the six smokejumpers being delivered to the fire was severely injured. Initial reports were a fractured femur with possible tissue/artery damage. Smokejumpers on scene were rendering medical aid and requested a medevac. At this same time, NPS exclusive use helicopter and module {NXXX} were departing this same fire for base and responded to the jump spot. Local EMS helicopter ordered at same time. Once over the jump spot, it was determined by the pilot and helicopter manager that the site was a no-go for the inbound EMS helicopter {Agusta A119}. This was due to the small size and slope of the potential helispot. After weighing the options, NXXX and crew landed and configured aircraft with litter kit. Helicopter then returned to jump spot with HMGB and HECM {both EMTB} to attempt a landing and patient retrieval. Once over the site, the pilot and manager evaluated the situation and due to the significant risk to the patients life, time of day and no ground options for evacuation, it was decided to attempt a landing in this marginal site. The pilot was able to maneuver the aircraft onto the one possible landing site, however the slope exceeded the limit for the NXXX. The pilot brought the aircraft onto the spot, but needed to maintain full power with the back half of the skids off of the ground during the loading of the injured firefighter. Once on the ground, the HMGB and HECM exited, briefed the 5 other jumpers on scene about the loading process and the patient was loaded on aircraft. Helitack crew boarded and the aircraft departed the spot at approximately 2050 hrs. Patient flown directly to Mercy Medical Center in Durango, arrival 2100 hrs. Patient and helitack crew offloaded and NXXX departed for airport, arriving at approximately 2110. As the Helicopter Manager, I feel that the pilot did an exceptional job during this emergency situation. He was able to skillfully pilot the aircraft into a very difficult spot, during low light conditions and successfully retrieve the injured before dark. This injured smokejumper was delivered to the hospital less than one hour after his injury. There were several deviations from policy and SOPs during this operation due to the emergency situation. These were all discussed between pilot and Helicopter Mgr. prior to completing the medevac.

Additionally, in the fuel types of XXXX with limited elevation on the ground it is impossible in most situations to gain a vantage point which to serve as an adequate lookout.

207,11-0767,"on august 3, 2011 a state of montana mt205 was dispatched to initial attack a fire 12 miles northeast of bonner, mt. upon arrival at the fire {rainbow bend 961001} the helitack crew attached the bambi bucket to the aircraft and began to fight the fire. the pilot proceeded to the blackfoot river, about ¼ mile north of the fire and commenced bucket operations. following the fourth bucket drop, the aircraft was returning to the river and was in a left turn when the pilot experienced the following: 1. grinding noises coming from the engine/transmission area. 2. excessive vibration. 3. a droop or reduction in rotor rpm. 4. surges in engine rpm. the pilot elected to perform a precautionary landing based on the aircraft behavior. landing options were extremely limited in the area. the pilot initially considered landing on highway 200 but the traffic was too heavy. adjacent to the highway was a small parking area used to access the river. several vehicles were parked in this area with people present. the pilot opted to split the difference between the parking area and the highway and landed on the turn-off area leading into the parking area. this turn-off area resulted in the aircraft landing with 9 degrees of lateral slope from right to left and 4 degrees nose up. the pilot did not jettison the bambi bucket on approach to the landing area, which resulted in his making a near vertical descent to the landing. the bucket was located to the left rear of the left skid, down slope from the aircraft. the bucket cables and bucket position indicated the bucket was placed and not dragged during landing. during the landing the aircraft moved forward about 18 inches from the initial touchdown point of the right rear skid tube. as the pilot placed the aircraft on the slope the aircraft slid about 16 inches down slope as the aircraft came to rest. there was a curved guard rail immediately aft of the aircraft. the final position of the aircraft resulted in a 20 inch separation of the tail skid and the guard rail. evidence suggests that the tail skid and tail rotor were over the guard rail during the landing event. no contact between the aircraft and guard rail occurred. the pilot attempted to perform an emergency engine shut-down following the landing, but failed to move the throttle past the idle cut-off position. the main fuel, and battery switches were placed in the off position. the pilot safely exited the aircraft, retrieved the fire extinguisher. the aircraft produced smoke from the engine/transmission for about 20 minutes after landing.

Kingsley asked what the flight level for of the aircraft would be. Per the Klamath Falls Air Attack and the Lakeview SEAT Manager, the aircraft would be flying around 7,500 ft. MSL when enroute to the incident and 8,500 coming back to LKV. Kingsley said that would work for them as the floor in the MOA is 11,000. After speaking with Burns later in the morning the LIFC aircraft dispatcher found out the heavy airtankers would be flying also and relayed that to Kingsley Field. The de-confliction report that morning indicated that Juniper / Hart and Goose MOAs would be active with a floor of 11,000 feet and the following footnote **notified of heavy activity throughout day**.  At the Klamath Falls ATB {LMT}, tankers were on and available. Both aircrews were given the de-confliction information with the morning briefing materials. Both airtankers launched to the Bone Creek Basin fire at 11:30. Airtankers had already launched to the fire from RDM at 1030. It is unknown if those aircrews received de-confliction information at that time. The four airtankers proceeded to load and return from LMT. Tankers 161 and 41 did not receive deconfliction information on the MOAs from the airtanker base at this time. At 1545 the LIFC aircraft dispatch received a call from a Lt. Col from Kingsley stating there was almost an incident within the Juniper Hart MOA. He said that they didn’t know we {federal airtankers} were in there and if the tankers were flying VFR they must have been penetrating the clouds. One of the military planes got close to one of the tankers and they were concerned. The aircraft dispatcher gave the Lt Col the Klamath Falls Airtanker Base Manager’s number as well because he wanted to relay the information to them. Both aircraft dispatchers deconflicted the day prior and in the morning of the 18th.  Another phone call was made to Kingsley on the morning of the 18th to notify of the planned Air Attack flights to Burns from Klamath Falls. Kingsley was updated about the additional orders for Airtankers/SEATs that would be operating to/from Klamath Falls. The Burns Interagency Coordination Center was also notified of the military traffic in the MOA. The Klamath Falls base manager received a call from a Lt. Col. at Kingsley on the afternoon of September 18th. He was concerned that F15’s from the Kingsley base were operating in the Hart South MOA and that airtankers supporting the Bone Creek Basin and Blitzen Crossing fires were crossing the MOA at approximately 13,000 ft. He said the airtankers were “in weather” with low visibility and that there had been a instance where aircraft had been in close proximity. The Airtanker Base manager told him that he would speak to the aircrews and let them know that the MOA is active and relay his concerns. He asked the Airtanker Base manager to send him an email letting him know that he had done this. The manager spoke with each air crew that day which consisted of {3} Tankers. Tanker XXX at this time was already heading for RDM. T XX had been operating across the MOA at about 7500’ and TXX and TXXX had been operating at approximately 13,500’. The TXXX crew mentioned that they had been “on top” of weather on their way over. I told them the MOA was active and expressed the Lt. Col.’s concern. I sent an email to the Lt. Col. letting him know that I spoke with the aircrews. By this time, the airtankers were on hold. They did not go back to the fire.  In the afternoon of the 18th, after all airtankers were on hold, both the LIFC dispatch office and the LMT airtanker base received calls from Kingsley Field. They were concerned that the heavy airtankers were flying at 13,500 and in the clouds and he thought that should be an IFR flight and wasn’t sure why they were flying that high. The Assistant Tanker Base Manager was contacted by Kingsley field who reported an airtanker observed at 11,000 feet in the clouds. The Assistant Airtanker Base Manager mentioned to the officer, that de-confliction information was received and relayed to the pilots of the active MOA’s. The Assistant Airtanker Base Manager then spoke with the aircrews. The pilots stated they had already lowered their routes and had to get around the weather. The Tanker was able to lower his flight paths to 7500. A couple pilots mentioned getting T-CAS hits from jets far overhead. There were no further flights to these fires that day or after. The airtanker base has received word from the National Airspace Program Manager that the military had notified the FAA of these events. On Monday, the 29th of September, the National Airspace Program Manager called the Unit Aviation Officer asking for clarification and information about the events of September 8th, as the FAA was asking if there was a mutual agreement to fly at 7500ft.

241,99-0052,"While performing initial attack activities on the Cypress Creek Fire, the pilot had to land at the helispot for additional fuel. Once the refueling was complete, the pilot was to return to the fire to perform bucket drops.When the pilot initiated the starting sequence, the engine failed to start. The pilot attempted a second time to start the engine and it once again failed to start. With a second failure, the pilot decided not to try again until the problem was looked at by a mechanic. At this time, I informed the pilot that I did not hear the usual 'clicking' sound that the ignitor makes on a normal start. About this time, the mechanic for a Bell 212 assigned to the fire arrived at the helispot. The pilot, which is also the owner of the aircraft, asked the mechanic to take a look at the helicopter to see if he could find out what was causing the engine not to start. The mechanic started by removing the ignitor plug to see if it might have some carbon built up on the end, not allowing it to operate properly. Once it was removed, I, along with the mechanic and the pilot, observed only a small amount of carbon deposits on the end of the ignitor. The ignitor was cleaned and replaced in the engine, and the security wire was replaced. The pilot then tried to start the engine resulting another failed start.At this time, I made a call to Region-8 maintenance inspector Bill McMillan to inform him of the situation. With very poor cellular service on my end of the call, I was able to understand him enough to hear that it was alright to proceed, but that when I was able to get to a hard line phone, I was to call him and let him know what had happened.I knew that the mechanic was not a 407 mechanic, but I did allow him to proceed because what he was doing, in my opinion, did not warrant the necessity of a 407 mechanic. I was later informed by Mr. McMillan that this should not have been allowed because the 407 is such a new type aircraft and  that with the 'FADEC' system problems that occur might not be what they seem and need to be checked out by a qualified 407 mechanic.--Lesson learned.  The mechanic then decided to try and clean the fuel nozzle to see if this would help the situation. Once this was done, another attempt was made to start the engine which proved to be successful.The helicopter started each time necessary the rest of the day without fail. The pilot/owner of the aircraft decided to fly his mechanic in to take a look at the helicopter. The mechanic was at the helibase the next morning, Wednesday, April 21. He added a shim to the fuel nozzle and checked out the aircraft.  The aircraft started without incident. A call was made to Bill McMillan to inform him of the situation.  Mr. McMillan released the aircraft for work and told me that if the problem occurred again, that I was to make the aircraft unavailable and stop it from working. Once we were released to work we were dispatched back to the fire. When the pilot tried to start the engine, it once again failed to start. When this occurred, the mechanic tried changing out the ignitor plug and adding another shim to the fuel nozzle. This proved to be ineffective. At this time, I declared the helicopter unavailable and made a call to Mr. McMillan to keep him apprised of the situation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

246,13-0863,"On August 28, 2013 a cargo mission involving multiple loads delivered to multiple helispots was initiated by a handcrew’s request via cell phone to the Air Ops. At the time, the type 2 helibase had four helicopters, a USFS exclusive use AS350-B3 with crew, a National CWN 214 with a CWN crew, a National exclusive use S-61 with manager, and a National CWN UH-1H {restricted} with a manager and manager trainee. Other HECMs on base were assigned to ABRO, ABRO trainee, and cargo. Supply dropped off the cargo midafternoon and loads were built in the designated cargo area using the HOGE-J allowable from the 214’s load calc. At some point it was decided by HEB2 that the loads should be shared between the 214 and the UH-1H. Helitack in cargo divided up the loads between the two ships according to the receiving crew’s point of contact. It was determined that the 214 would deliver three loads, the UH-1H would deliver two loads, and whoever returned first would fly the last load {total of 6 picks}. The manager and pilots of the 214 were fully aware of their mission and already spooling when an individual came to the managers of the UH-1H with two pieces of paper containing a lat/long, contact, and weight for the two loads they would take. They were told each ship would fly two loads and that there was a fifth load going with the first aircraft back. The managers briefed their pilot, discussing a number of concerns, but determined that the mission could be carried out safely and that they would proceed. The first red flag was that the HECM who brought the load info from cargo did not know the weight of the last load, but that would be easily resolved with a radio call prior to the final pick, and because the 214 would be the first one out they would probably be the first back thus taking the load in question, making the concern irrelevant. The second topic of concern related to the fact that the first pick would not only be the heaviest, but its weight was actually 2 pounds above the UH-1H’s allowable for the day. It was determined that taking a load over allowable was mitigated due to the pick-up and delivery locations being much lower in elevation than the load calc was completed for coupled with fuel burn from a maintenance run-up and power check completed prior to the mission. All involved agreed the mission could be safely completed. As the 214 called deck to lift and the UH-1H began his start up, ABRO{t} called cargo asking for manifests and other info relating to the mission. A very confusing radio exchange in which cargo told the ABRO{t} “load 3 will be {{{{#}}}}1 going to ____, load 1 will be {{{{#}}}}2 going to lat/long with a contact of ___, BREAK.” At which point ABRO{t} stepped in saying “all I need to know is what is the first load out, and who is it going to so I can inform Div.___,” and to “please bring the manifests for each load to the box.” After the 4th pick, the UH-1H managers saw that there were actually six loads… not the five they were briefed about. Due to a seemingly large amount of confusion at the helibase for a simple cargo mission, the UH-1H manager decided to walk down to the box and look at the manifests and posted load calcs. He discovered a number of discrepancies in the numbers on the manifests. The allowables for all manifested loads were based off of the 214’s HOGE-J, which was 376 pounds heavier than the UH-1H’s. The manifest showed a remote hook with longline at 60 pounds, when the UH-1H hook and longline combined weight was 91 pounds. Although the cargo area was too far from their pad too see all the equipment clearly, the manager could tell each load consisted of three daisy-chained nets or blivets, which should’ve used two leadlines and three swivels. The manifests did not show the appropriate weights for that combination of equipment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I asked the pilot if he needed the communication information and he said that the Situation Unit Leader made the arrangements to go to the Isabel fire. Prior to departure, the pilot stopped by the Foster Helibase communication trailer to inform them he had been ordered to IR map the fire, Isabel. He was asked if he had the frequencies for the Isabel. He said he had received them from the Needle Air Attack the day before (on 9/14).5738Y departed the Foster Helibase at 1330. In route to the Isabel fire until 1405. 8 miles out, 38Y attempted to contact Salmon Helibase on the given frequency with no result. The pilot tried again a second time again with no avail. 38Y pilot then tried a secondary frequency (not utilized the day before) given to the pilot by the Needle Air Attack. On that frequency he communicated with the Salmon Air Attack and discovered that he had flown into an active air operation.Note: On 9/14 the previous day, 38Y was dispatched to the same fire and the Foster Helibase communications said there were no air operations taking place on the Isabel. Arriving on the fire, there was one type 2 on the ground at the Salmon Helibase.Corrective Actions:Situations needs to go through the proper ordering channel by using the Air Operations Branch Director to place the order. By doing this both Teams will know what aircraft are being used on that incident and can give permission for the flight.Statement by ATGS on 9/15:On 9/15/03 received a request at approx. 10 am for ATGS mission on Isabel fire #637. Aircraft Dispatcher, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, was told at time of request about a new air-to-ground and new victor frequency that he mentioned to me he was unaware of . The requests had not gone thru proper resource order request channels. He spoke with requesting resource about this.During ATGS mission over Isabel at approx. 1400 I spotted a jet ranger in the fire airspace over a ridge where Lead 69 and air tankers were working. I immediately notified Lead 69 and inquired at Salmon helibase if they knew about this helicopter. They did not. Soon after that 38Y identified himself saying his mission was mapping. I told him that would not be possible at this time as we had T-62 about 2 minutes out and another tanker soon after. I moved him east of the fire camp area or said he could set down at Salmon helibase. I told him to stay below 7,000’. Lead 69 then requested he move north and east of the fire camp as directly east would be “the down and out” for the tankers how he was setting that up. 38Y stated he had tried to contact the fire using yesterdays frequencies and when no one answered, assumed on one was over the fire so came on into airspace. I gave him the correct (new) frequencies and both Lead 69 and myself discussed the situation that had occurred with him over the radio as we were departing fire, mission complete.Statement by Aircraft Dispatcher:At 0946 received a radio call from Air Ops requesting our Air Attack 634CT to come to Isabel Fire to access need for Air Tankers on incident. At that time he gave me new victor Freq. and new Air Ground Freq. I asked him where they got the new Freqs, since I had no request from ICP for new Freqs for the incident., he told me he got Freqs from the  communication unit leader. I then called the Communication Unit Leader and asked him where he got the Freqs and he told me he called NIC and got them from them. I then told him since I had the Aircraft Orders for the Incident and that the orders needed to come through me at CWICC so I could track them in Ross and coordinate those freqs with our responding  aircraft.

If the proper procedures would of been followed the Freqs would have been passed on to N38Y before he was dispatched to the Isabel Fire.  I knew nothing about the near miss over incident until later when XXXXXXXX -Helibase Manager for the Needle Fire called me and told me about what happened.Statement by XXXXXXXXX, ASGS Isabel:Helicopter 38Y departed the Needles fire to map the Isabel fire without the proper radio frequencies. 38Y failed to establish contact at 12NM from the Isabel fire and did not hold at 7NM when contact was not established with Air Attack or the Helibase.The first contact with 38Y was with Air Attack as 38Y flew into the fire area. The other aircraft over the incident were Lead 69, tankers 62 and 66 and SEAT 185. The presence of 38Y unannounced over the fire during tanker operations created an unsafe working environment and could have resulted in an aircraft mishap. Wenatchee Air Attack and Lead 69 did a very good job of keeping control of the airspace and keeping 38Y in a safe working area away from the tanker operation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What happened - Enroute to gravel pit, the securing nylon strap for the Plastic Sphere Dispenser {PSD} slipped through the buckle and about 8 feet of the strap was ripped out of the cabin by the air friction on the strap and consequentially, the strap dangled under the belly of the ship during the remainder of the flight. Pilot could see the strap with the skid mirror and determined there was no factor with the tail rotor. Background - The PSD machine was secured to the floor of the aircraft with a seat belt-size nylon strap that ties one side of the PSD to the other by routing the strap under the door around the belly of the ship and back to the opposite side of the PSD machine.

I could not establish radio communications with dispatch on the Forest direct frequency that is usually used for aircraft in the valley. I had just arrived as Helicopter Manager and had taken over the Manager position from another HMGB. He had informed me all frequencies were in the aircraft and it was ready to go. I did not check before lifting off, as the Helicopter had flew the day before. What I did not find out till later was that they were transmitting OK, but were not receiving well. I tried a few other frequencies then dispatch did hear me on the state repeater, by then we had established VHF-AM radio communication with Air Tactical and the 4 other Helicopters on the fire. Traffic was getting congested so we landed at the Fire Helibase and found a receive tone programmed into the Direct Frequency we were trying to use in the radio.

They were originally headed to the 123 fire, but due to the lack of a Lead plane, ended up needing to jettison a load of retardant. Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}1 relayed the lat/long for the South Ridge Promontory Point jettison site to the pilot via radio on the National Flight Follow NFF frequency. The lat/long given was 40 16.9833 x 112 28.4000, which was obtained via a paper sign that hangs behind the aircraft desk. Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}1 went off shift, and briefed Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}2. At 2052, as the T-XYZ appeared over the Great Salt Lake in AFF, he came up on NFF and said that he had passed the jettison point, mentioned Tooele Army Depot, and Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}2 confirmed the coordinates we had with him. He confirmed the coordinates, said that it was behind him and he needed to do a 180 to get there and asked if that is what we’d like him to do. We looked at AFF, and grabbed a GPS point from the program, which was at 41 17.1546 x 112 33.304, was ½ mile directly west of Promontory Point. As he was flying at 357 knots, and the position data was at least 2 minutes old, were unsure of his actual position but knew it would be north of there. We instructed him to turn around and fly back to the confirmed coordinates to jettison the load. He agreed. At around 2110, Aircraft Dispatcher {{{#}}}2 – told me that she thought the two jettison sites signs were mixed up, and that T-XYZ was actually headed to a jettison site called Rock Creek. She showed me AFF which put T-XYZ near the Tooele Army Depot, and showed me a map in CAD of the plotted coordinates of what was at 40 16.9833 x 112 28.4000. It was a chunk of BLM land east of the toe of the slope of the Onaqui Mountains, south of Highway 199, and West of the Tooele Army Depot. After looking at the spot, I was fairly certain that was not a jettison spot as I thought all three of ours were on Promontory Point, however I did not think we had enough time to get the pilot back up to the correct area to jettison before pumpkin time which was in about 12 or 13 minutes. I figured it was safer to have him jettison in the light in an inappropriate area, so that he could still see and avoid things that needed to be avoided, than to have him jettison in the dark and potentially endanger the lives of all pilots on board the aircraft, and possibly people on the ground. After he had moved away from the coordinates, the pilot confirmed that he had dropped his retardant at the given coordinates.

At this point the pilot diagnosed the issue as a tripped breaker in the avionics. After resetting the breaker and reestablishing communications the breaker popped a second time. Due to the simplicity of the airspace at the time the pilot chose not to reset the breaker a second time, and promptly returned to helibase to further diagnose the problem.

About 20 minutes after departure from Helibase the mechanic noticed numerous oil spots of what appeared to be helicopter engine or transmission oil on the side of the fuel truck, and mechanics pod. Mechanic requested that Helibase call helicopter back from the fire to investigate the oil source. While helicopter was returning the pilot noticed oil pressure on the number 1 engine fluctuating, still within operating limits but fluctuating. Additionally, about five minutes from Helibase the pilot saw the fuel valve warning light illuminate on engine number 1. Helicopter made a safe and uneventful landing at Helibase and the mechanic had the pilot shut down. 
The Mechanic investigated the oil leak and found that the oil cap was missing. After a run-up was performed the day prior due to seven days of inactivity the mechanic topped off the engine oil but did not replace the cap after topping off. This allowed engine oil to splash out into the engine compartment during the flight, and oil pressure to fluctuate.

H-xxx then had a wind switch and started to settle and started to burp more water from his bucket but his rate of decent continued.

H-xxx immediately notified Air-Attack of what happened and finished his cycle dropping water. After tapping the fence H-xxx moved further back in the dipsite and took a little less water.

At the time this happened the ground crew was talking on the radio about a huge wind switch. At Cortez airport the winds were at 8kts gusting to 26kts reported by CEZ ASOS.

A ground crew was sent out to the dip site and did not find any damage to the fence but did find a screw that was protruding from a fence post that the bucket had scraped on. The bucket did have a light scratch, but no significant damage was done.  Pictures attached.

This occurred at the box on the helibase, about ¼ mile from the helicopter pad. The ASGS said that nobody was ordering the helicopters to move, so if the company decided there was an eminent threat, it was there decision to do so and the flight would be non-revenue. After the discussion, the HMGB drove down to the pad. When the HMGB got to the pad, he said the helicopter spooled up and was lifting off before he got out of the truck. The HMGB reported afterward that he did not know if the aircraft had communication with anyone, as the wind of the coming storm along with radio chatter prevented him for knowing for sure. The HMGB was also unsure of how many souls were on board at that time {1830}. After the incident, neither the personnel at the helibase {HMGB, ASGS, or others}, or dispatch knew SOB/FOB for the ship. At 1720, the incident HB got a call from the Helitanker: “Off HB to Torrington: will contact Casper.” The aircraft desk noticed a Type 1 helicopter go positive AFF at 1724. At first, the desk thought it was a local fire mission. By 1730, the two dispatchers were discussing the craft and its mission. They knew of nothing it could be doing that would take it to the east. Contact on National FF was attempted, and a message was left with the AOBD on the incident. Great Plains Dispatch was asked to contact the ship for mission, fuel, souls. They couldn`t reach them. About 1757, the ship went red on AFF. We again called Great Plains Dispatch Aircraft Desk. The ASGS was notified dispatch that had no contact with the ship and they had gone red on AFF. He said they were moving to avoid the storms. Meanwhile, dispatch called the Casper tower. The tower had not heard from the craft and informed Torrington was an unmanned strip. Dispatch called sheriff`s office and asked them to send an officer toward the airport. At 1802, AOBD called and said the helicopter was moving to avoid storms and was calling Air Support to see the status of the ship. At 1811, the GACC called to inquire on HT status. During that call, AOBD called back and informed all that the manager had contact with the pilot and everyone was alright.

After about 1.5 hours into the fuel cycle the pilots noticed the engine oil pressure in the {#}1 engine dropped. According to the pilots, this is what took place: ``As we were descending for our 5th drop of retardant we noticed our number 1 engine oil pressure drop to the bottom of the precautionary range {40 psi}. This immediately grabbed our attention and we continued with the drop as we had power out, were lined up, and needed to shed the weight anyway if we have a legitimate engine oil system failure. We made our run-out downhill and loaded the engine to see if an increased power requirement would bring the pressure back up to the normal range. It did not but rather stayed in the precautionary range so we notified air attack we were returning to the helibase with an engine oil pressure in the precautionary range as we came off the drop. We emphasized that we weren’t in a dire situation and he kindly asked us to notify him when we make it safely back. Enroute to the helibase the oil pressure continued to decay and we shut down the {#}1 engine at the top of the ridge above helibase,{approximately 2 miles out} as the oil pressure started to drop below the precautionary range. Right after we cleared the tank for landing, we contacted air-attack and told him landing assured and made an uneventful, single-engine landing at approximately 1548. Subsequent inspection determined the number 1 engine oil pressure relief valve failed thus causing the decay in pressure. One of the final steps in in the Before Landing Checks is disarming the tank which causes the doors to open and any residual water or retardant to come out.

A precautionary landing was initiated when the aircraft cabin and the fire crew in the rear of the aircraft were exposed to a strong burning odor and fumes from an overheated fan blower motor.The aircraft was held on the pad at BOI for an extended period to allow for air tanker traffic on several large fires nearby.  The pilot turned on the fan blower to provide air circulation for the rear flight crew.  Prior to departure, the pilot shut off the ICS system to the rear of the aircraft.  BOI Tower and Approach were both very busy with the Air Tanker Traffic and the pilot wanted to keep a 'sterile cockpit' in his departure from the airport.

491,19-0277,"During bucket operations on the XXX fire the long line became wrapped over the rear right skid of the helicopter. Hotshots Perspective: Hotshots were working helo in division alpha doing bucket drops. Helo returned from dip to hotshots and made a drop. After the drop hotshots returned to work and did not see anything wrong during the drop. They noted that the pilot had been doing good work, but the winds were a little squirrely with an upslope component. The also stated that Helo was droping 50 to 100 feet above canopy. After drop helo returned to alpha dip. Div-A perspective: Div-A was at a cabin adjacent to alpha dip with an engine. Helo was going back and forth between alpha dip and dropping water in XXX canyon. There was a middle ridge in between the dip and where the drops were taking place. Distance from dip to middle ridge was described as around mile. Div-A noted that he saw the helo near the middle ridge and the bucket appeared to be flying erratically but was pretty far away and he was looking through some canopy when he made the observation. The Helo then arrived at the dip and the bucket started to come down through canopy. As the bucket came down an Engine crewmember alerted division that the long line was over the skid. Div-A contacted helo and alerted pilot as bucket was entering water. Pilot asked if it was over the front or back and was told back. Pilot then lifted and appeared to be releasing water as he lifted. Pilot then returned to Helitack to get fixed. Engine Perspective: Engine was at alpha dip with Div- A, Engine noticed Helo flying to dip making S-turns on the approach. As helo came to the dip and started to lower bucket towards water they saw the long line was over the skid and notified division. Pilot Comment - I was supporting XXX Hot Shots with a 240gal bambi bucket on the XXX Fire 06/26/2019 at approximately 1200 local time. At drop {{{#}}}11 my ground contact asked for a trail drop about 400 feet higher on the ridge above the previous drops. I made the drop and climbed over the ridge and started my descent to the dip site. The dip site was relatively close and at a lower altitude. I flew some S-turns to slow my forward progress to allow more time to descend. I filled the bambi bucket at the dip site and as I picked the bucket up the helicopter gently rolled a little to the right. I lowered the bucket back into the pond and slowly picked it up again and the same gentle roll repeated. I released the water because I suspected the long line was hung up somewhere on the helicopter’s landing gear. The dip site manager confirmed my suspicion. I released the water and flew back to Heli-Spot 3. Upon landing it was discovered the long line was over the portion of the skid tube behind the aft cross tube. My helitack crew fixed the problem and I returned to supporting the hot shots. The thunderstorms that air attack briefed us on were starting to form and winds were moderate but manageable. During my S-Turn descent my air speed was between 30-40kts to minimize forward progress to allow more time to descend to the dip site. My turns where never more then 20 degrees each direction and control movements during the drops where never excessive. Manager comments – Helicopter launched from helibase at 10:40am for bucket work. Helicopter was configured for bucket operations at H-3. Longline and bucket configuration was correctly completed and all checks were made without incident. Helitack personnel were at H-3 when Div informed Helicopter XXX of longline issue. As soon as Div reported the issue the pilot released the water and flew to the helispot. The helicopter was landing at the helispot when we took some photos of the longline over the skid. The manager spoke with the pilot while HECM’s fixed the longline as well as inspected it for any damage. No damage was identified on the longline, bucket or aircraft. The pilot and manager discussed any concerns with the weather, dip site and bucket operations overall. Pilot stated everything was going well but the winds were “squirrely” do to outflow winds from a system building nearby. He and I felt comfortable returning back to bucket operations to finish the 20 minutes left on the fuel cycle, which was completed without incident. When we returned to helibase we called an AMI about any concerns he may have. AMI had no concerns. We re-inspected the longline and bucket, everything looked as it should and was in good working order. XXX had completed 11 drops without incident prior to longline over skid incident. Air Attack had reported feeling outflow winds shortly before the incident with the longline. The distance between the dipsite and dropping area was approximately 1 mile with a ridge line between the two. ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

HMGB was aprox 50 feet in front of aircraft as crash rescue/fire protection. Aircraft was configured for aerial ignition mission on NF. Pilot and HMGB established good communication on air to ground frequency as a routine and did so as aircraft spooled up. Left front door of aircraft was off at FIRB’s request with Pilot’s approval. Aircraft was at flight idle. After comm check HMGB heard FIRB seconds later, on air to ground say, “could you hold on to this” as FIRB was digging in his left front pocket. HMGB then made it two steps toward aircraft to take object from FIRB then heard a sharp noise followed by several other noises aprox twenty feet to left side of aircraft. HMGB then hand signaled pilot to shut aircraft down. Pilot did not fully understand so HMGB approached pilot door to tell him to shut down. Dispatch was notified there was a situation and aircraft would be unable to perform aerial ignition for RX burn. Pilot, FIRB, PLDO, and HMGB discussed what had just happened. A pocket knife was under-hand tossed by FIRB from aircraft toward HMGB, which made contact with one main rotor blade. FIRB had attempted to toss the knife in the grass just off the asphalt in front of aircraft to avoid anything falling from aircraft during flight. Upon contact with the rotor, the knife burst into pieces landing off to the left side of the aircraft. Pilot inspected blades finding place of impact.

This is ok if your operating from a cement pad as this mission was but would be unworkable on most fires or other field operations. 3) No agency personnel were on this flight but on some IR missions it may be desirable.

There are some very valuable lessons learned within this Safecom.I was on standby in Grand Junction acting as ATP (Air Tactical Pilot.) It was the end of the standby shift and we had just finished plugging the aircraft with intake plugs, pitot covers and prop stops. I was inside the cabin when ramp manager approached with a dispatch to a fire. The mechanic that is always with the aircraft, standing outside, said that he would unplug the aircraft while I stayed inside the plane. I watched him as he traveled around the airplane grabbing the plugs and other equipment. I watched as he placed the bag of items unplugged into the plane. The cockpit checklist was complete up to engine start and started the right engine. The ATS (Air Tactical Supervisor) yelled stop engine, which I did. At the same time I noticed the ramp manager giving the stop engine sign. There was still and engine plug in the intake of the engine. There was no damage caused, as there were only one or two revolutions of the prop before the cut sign was given (no engine light off). A complete walk around was performed and a restart was done after another complete checklist was completed. Engine was started with no mishap.As embarrassing as this is for me, there are several lessons learned here that I would like to comment on.1.	As pilot in command I should have been the person to remove all the plugs from the aircraft. The PIC is responsible for the pre-flight of the aircraft. It would have only taken me but a few seconds to perform the task and ensure of a proper preflight. This is a classic example of “complacency.”2.	The use of ramp managers and other personnel such as them are invaluable to the safety of the aircraft and the crews in and around them.3.	This situation shouts CRM. In the many years of aerial fire fighting, I have had several ground personnel come up to me and point out things on the aircraft that they had a question about. 90% of the time it was something if importance. The ATS was watching the ramp manager as I was looking at the flight panel. Using the two-crew members in the ASM role caught the engine stop signal way before I would have if it had been a single pilot operation.Job well done on the part of Ramp Manager, because of his actions, we didn’t cause any damage to the aircraft and were able to continue with the mission.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The private ships continued operation while the ATGS’s kept other incident aircraft separated from them. 7/19/2014 Private fire forces continued to take action as the day before, but now the TFR was in place that covered their operations where two private helicopters were working. Fire forces engaged the fire, specifically trying to protect a structure. The complex fire forces on the ground tried contacting the helicopters. The ATGS tried also. Neither helicopter communicated with the ATGS to ask permission to enter the TFR, nor did they communicate when asked to do so. All complex fire aviation forces were withdrawn from the area. Ground forces did not feel safe without agency air support so they also disengaged. The manager of the private company was contacted later in the day by the complex IC who explained the gravity of TFR violation and the effect of their forces on the planned action of the complex forces. The manager said his forces would comply with the communications, but would continue to take independent action with all his forces. 7/20/2014 Private forces continued action. The private company requested a change in the TFR so they could dry cherry orchards with predicted rain on 7/22 and fight fire. Private aircraft did comply with radio communications. Complex aviation assets were separated from their forces. 7/21/2014 Private forces continued action. Private aircraft did comply with radio communications. Complex aviation assets were separated from their forces. The fire behavior was such by then that a change in the TFR was justified. The TFR was changed effective about 1800 and to continue daily. This TFR excluded the orchards and the independent fire action area.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

519,02-1149,"Crew was alerted for a MAFFS mission to the Million Fire from Colorado Springs at 1500 local(mdt), after sitting on standby for the previous 3 days without flying.  This was the first fire mission for this crew, this season.  It was discovered in the pits, prior to launch, that the MAFFS unit dispensing tubes would not relock in the exended position once brought into the aircraft.  So the pilot decided to leave the tubes out and locked and fly to the fire unpressurized.  On the previous flight (deployment from Charlotte, NC to Co. Springs)an equipment malfunction code affecting the radar was discovered by the crew, which resolved itself well prior to reaching Co. Springs and showed no further indication of degradation.  Just prior to take off on the incident flight, the crew again had the equipment malfunctions code, and took off expecting to code to clear.  After takeoff the pilot climbed to 10,000 msg and visually cleared terrain crossing the first ridge southwest of Co. Springs and on across the valley that provided terrain clearance.  During this time the navigator was having increasing difficulty using the radar for terrain clearance.  The visibility was deteriorating but still well above VFR.  As the crew worked to clear the radar problem and plot position using GPS, the pilot was skirting high terrain on the left with lower terrain on the right.  The pilot attempted to cut across the end of a ridge extending from the terrain on the left to the valley on the right.  As the aircraft passed the extension of the ridge on the right he realized that he may be able to cross the saddle and went to maximum power and flaps 50%.  The flight engineer closed the engine bleed valves for maximum power.  After a few seconds the crew realized for sure they would not clear the saddle on the right and the pilot turned left up the canyon towards the last remaining option, a shallow saddle between two peeks.  The pilot directed emergency drop of the retardant load and flaps to 60%.  The copilot and loadmasters accomplished the drop and the copilot positioned the flaps to 60%.  As the load went out, the aircraft climbed over the saddle and out over low terrain.

522,03-1155,"At about 1730 hours, July 14, 2003, Coronado Initial Attack Dispatch called me to see if I was available to fly to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation to work on an initial attack fire, the Popcorn Incident.  I replied that I was, and acquired all the necessary information, including resource order numbers, frequencies, air and ground contacts, etc.  My pilot and I departed Tucson International Airport (TIA) at 1816, under partly cloudy, but threatening skies.  Airport weather indicated moderate to severe thunderstorms to the northeast and southeast of the airport. As we cleared the terrain to the north of Tucson, we began to receive radio traffic from the SCA aerial observer, P3, who was flying over the fire, and I called San Carlos Dispatch to let them know I was inbound to the Popcorn Fire, and approximate ete to the fire.  San Carlos Dispatch told me that P3 was over the fire and that he seemed to be having trouble transmitting over the assigned VHF frequency, 127.975. Between 1824 and 1857 hours, as we approached the fire area, P3 was attempting to talk to heavy air tanker, T55, SEATS 411 and 459, both flying out of the SEAT Base at Whiteriver, and me, on VHF 127.975.  As I got closer, it became apparent that the pilot who was flying P3 was in communication with T55, who was on scene, and that from the target description being given to T55, the P3 pilot intended to drop T55`s retardant load on the fire.  At 1850, T55 did drop his load on the fire.  When I got to within 12 nautical miles to the south of the fire, I called P3 on the victor frequency to seek permission to proceed to the fire.  As he had his hands full, he told me to stay where I was until he told me otherwise.  We went into an orbit around the east side of San Carlos Reservoir, and I noted that the air was extremely filled with smoke at that point.  We were orbiting at 9,500' and as we listened to the radio traffic, the overload on the observer was apparent.  At about that time, first he mentioned that two unidentified helicopters had gone through his airspace from the direction of Whiteriver, and a little later, he said that a news media helicopter had entered the airspace unannounced and without permission.By then, the two SEATS who had been working the fire were back in the airspace, and it didn't seem that either the pilot or observer of P3 had a firm grasp on the situation.  At this point, my pilot, whom I was flying with for the first time on 07/14/03, told me he felt very uncomfortable entering or proceeding into the airspace under the present escalating circumstances, so I called P3 and then San Carlos Dispatch and told them I thought they had an unsafe situation on their hands and that we were returning to Tucson.  They told me that was my option, so at 1857 hours, we returned to Tucson, where we landed at 1922.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We left the main helibase, Milan, with the impression that we were to get the helibase operational and then we would call back and have the ships sent over. The people running Milan Helibase were under the impression that they would send the ships out to do bucket work and after there fuel cycle would land at Blue Helibase. Before Blue helibase was operational helicopters started coming over to land. This came as a bit of a surprise to us working to get Blue Helibase ready since we did not know they were coming. The pad makers were laid out, but not all of the brush had been taken out of the safety circles. This was one of several things that were not ready when the helicopters started coming. Helicopter xxxx was one of the ships coming into land. The pilot was told to land on pad one and that a marsheller was heading out there. The marsheller got out there about the same time that xxxx was trying to set down his bucket. The marsheller moved out of the way and did not marshel the helicopter down. After the marsheller got out of the way and turned around he notice that the tail of xxxx was close to a bush near the edge of the safety circle. The pilot at this point was looking down as he was landing the ship. So the marsheller was not able to notify the pilot with hand signals. This was when the helicopter was almost down.

At about 1330 after flying .8 of an hour it was realized, between the Mechanic and Helicopter Manager, that there had been a green smudge on the tail rotor. At this point the Helibase called Air Attack and had xxxx return to base and shut down. There are several lesson that have been learned. 1. The importance of positive communications 2. Clean all obstructions out of safety circles 3. If Parking Tenders are not giving hand signals they need to be able to communicate via radio with the pilots. Pilot Comments: After helibase radioed that they were ready for me to land, I made my approach into the wind to pad #1. Marshaller was in place. I set water bucket down between the marshaller and the pad marker.I decended down to a 10 ft. hover and looked ahead at the marshaller, he was not marshalling,only standing and watching. He gave no indication of any hazard. I looked down and continued to land. After shutdown, I exited the helicopter and saw a juniper bush under the tail roter. In addition to other contributing factors, such as the helibase not ready to recieve landing helicopters, and the marshaller not giving any hand signals. The landing saftey circle was clearly not adequate for this helicopter. At a minimum the approach and departure path should have been cleared of brush in accordance to the IHOG chapter 8. The 90ft saftey circle is not large enough.If the pad marker is in the middle of the saftey circle and a helicopter lands with the nose on the pad, the tail roter will be outside the saftey circle. I recommend that the IHOG be changed to provide an adequate safey circle. Also, after discussion with helibase manager, I was informed that they were told by the regional helicopter operations specialist, in region 3, that a marshaller was not required, and a parking tender was to be used.

The helicopter will be flying close to our boundary so they wanted to give us a heads up.  I followed the helicopter on National Flight Following and when the helicopter got close to our forest boundary I advised the Air Attack of the presence of the helicopter.  As the helicopter came farther onto the forest, I called the other dispatch to see if they had contact with the helitanker and was told yes they were talking to the helitanker on National Flight Following. {I could not hear them talking}.  Air Attack was unable to raise the helitanker on either air to air or on National Flight following.  We tried calling the helicopter multiple times also.  While keeping a vigilant look at AFF because of all the aircraft we had in the air at the time, I saw that the helicopter was flying right toward our fire.  I immediately contacted Air Attack on the radio to make sure he had a visual on the helicopter and air attack said he did but still could not raise the Helicopter on Air to Air or NFF. The helicopter flew through our fire and continued flying to the north and then was no longer a safety issue to our aircraft. During this time I was also on the phone with the other dispatch trying to get them to contact the helicopter.  Again, I was told that the aircraft dispatcher had contact with the helicopter.  I informed them that the helicopter was flying right through the Temporary Flight Restriction and was told they would contact the pilot again on the radio.

It was the tanker's second trip to the fire.  Lead arrived at the fire just as the tanker completed his first drop.  The decision to load and return was made and when the tanker returned, Lead conducted the normal brief and provided a show-me run on that same spot fire a helicopter had been working on.  Getting to the drop site required a significant descent which put Lead way down in the valley, so it took a long time to climb out.  The tanker asked where Lead was and at the same time announced he was on a base to the drop.  The tanker continued with the run and Lead could see him on the base leg turning final.  Lead watched the two door drop.  Not long after the tanker was on the exit he made the radio call, inThis airplane is shaking real bad and I don't know why!in  Lead immediately told the tanker to punch off the remainder of the load which he did.  The tanker captain said it felt like the airplane was in a stall.  Not long after that, the captain announced he found the problem to be the life boat access door on top of the left wing between the left engine and fuselage had come open.  At the end of the valley on the exit a right turn was required.  Lead informed the tanker to turn right at the end of the valley as briefed earlier.  The captain said he had to go left because the tanker wouldn't turn right.  Lead said, inYou have to turn rightin.  The only way out was right unless enough altitude was gained to clear the ridges that formed the bowl if a left turn was made.  After retracting some flaps, the tanker captain informed Lead that the shaking wasn't as bad and that he could turn right.After having successfully negotiated the exit, Lead informed the tanker that he would follow him to landing.  The initial decision to go to Coeur'd Alene was scrapped after the tanker captain decided that the airplane flew better with no flaps.  Due to construction on the runways at Coeur'd Alene, there wasn't a long enough runway to accomodate a no flap landing.  Lead informed the tanker that his options were Spokane Intl.

621,02-0703,"At 1405 8 August, 2002, T-60 was dispatched to the in Sour Bisquitin fire. Our load was 2550 gallons of retardant and a full load of gas weighing 12,000 pounds. We departed Klamath Falls airort wihich was VFR, but the smoke was heavy in all quadrants. The temperature was in the mid 90's with an attendant high density altitude. Climb peformance was going to be poor as with all heavy piston powered aircraft. Translated, this means the climb rate was going to be marginal at times and fluctuating between zero and three hundred feet per minute for significant stretches of time. The tops of today's smoke layer varied between eitht and ten thousand feet. Obviously, quite a lengthy time is spent flying through this smoke in IFR conditions. When there's no way anyone can tell exactly what the visability is in the smoke, calling the visability acceptable, is a foolish game. Not only that, flying IFR without filing a flight plan, (totally unreasonable) is illegal. When I arrived over the coordinates given me in the dispatch, I was looking into a heavy layer of smoke below me. If the coordinates were a little off, that wasn't the problem. There was a heavy layer of smoke between me and the ground. The drop altitude was below 4000 feet. That was going to require me to descend 4000 feet through the smoke and hope there were no hills or other aircraft in my way. The odds are it could be done, and for that matter, has been done countless times. Where is the plane in front of me coming off his drop?. If I drop, where is the tanker coming in behind me? Sound sily? Think about it. Had I dropped my retardant load, the climb back to altitude would have been faster, but still in IFR conditions. What heading do I take to assure myself of missing the tallest peaks? Can I see them? Maybe. My decision was to stay at altitude(I actually climbed another 1000 feet to have somewhat better visability) and return to Klamath Falls loaded. Any tanker taking the same direct route between Klamath Falls and the fire would have to cope with the same visability problems. As it was, another tanker popped into view so close as to make the passing not much more than luck. The closing speed of two tankers doing 200 knots each is obviously abut 400 knots. Roughly figuring, that's about 700 feet per second closing rate. In the smoke, evasive actin would be moot. My decision was to abort the mission. We are constantly being told not to push a situation or take chances. The reluctance of pilots to follow this advice is evidenced all the time. The reason has as much to do with making money as with the inmachoin can do mentallity. The inSour Bisquitin fire is over 300,000 acres and drops I made days ago are now burried well inside the burn. We are called to drop upon lines where there is no visable ground support nor high priority ground to protect. We pilots are not blind, nor is this something new to behold. We are not building a fireproof wall with the retardant we drop. These few drops made before smoke shuts down the tanker opperation are not critical to the control of a monster fire. I'll gladly argue this point with anyone. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After conferring with dispatch, it was decided that we would recover to Fresno to facilitate getting the ATS to his vehicle for the return trip to Redding.

Due to drift smoke from fires in the bay area, the visibilities were varying at FAT and at the time of our arrival, they were were just below VFR minimums. I contacted approach control and requested an IFR clearance into Fresno. I received a clearance and approach began vectoring us for an ILS approach to runway 29R.

After getting established on the inbound course I recognized that I did not have a glideslope indication. We were approaching the point at which we should begin to intercept the glideslope and begin the decent phase. While I was trying to figure out why the glidesope indication was missing I allowed my altitude to vary and began a decent. I still had good visual contact with the ground and was beginning to pick up the airport environment. The approach controller alerted me to my altitude being lower than it should have been for my location and i began to correct back to the proper altitude.

We had placed one of the securing nuts on the inside instead of both being on the outside which caused the chute to be misaligned. Unfortunately we bench tested without the chute so were not aware of our mistake until the PSD operator experienced a jam. He attempted to clear it manually and noticed smoke coming from the machine. He immediately activated the emergency water system which extinguished the fire, and the helicopter returned to the helispot, where we discovered our mistake. After correcting our error the machine worked fine for a fuel cycle. During the next fuel cycle, however, the PSD operator experienced 3 jams in one chute. The first time, he was not able to clear the jam and the aircraft returned to the helibase where we were not able to duplicate or solve the jam. We were aware of the jamming issue caused by removing the hopper and then not removing the two spheres that block the chutes when this occurs: this was not what had occurred in this case. The aircraft returned to the unit where firing continued until he experienced two more jams in succession. He was able to manually clear both jams and complete ignition. Upon examining a random sample of Dragon Eggs, we discovered several spheres had a sharp, jagged piece of plastic protruding from the seam area. We had noticed a large number of shavings in the hopper and wondered if some of these protrusions broke off while the spheres were agitated in the hopper. We suspected that these hard plastic protrusions might be causing the eggs to jam in the chute.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
690,18-0525,"On July 7th at approximately 1600 during the second cycle of a water dropping mission on the fire, the pilot received an indication of a measurable gas temperature {mgt} exceedance on the diamond j 61000-092 mgt gauge. Thunderstorms began to encroach on the fire and the pilot informed air attack he needed to retrieve the crew and return to the helibase. After returning to the helibase, the pilot discovered the mgt gauge indicated that a mgt exceedance had occurred, 6 degrees for 37 seconds. The Diamond j mgt gauge does not confirm an exceedance has occurred until the aircraft is shut-down. After the crew had completed an AAR of the initial attack, the pilot notified the Manager/COR of the exceedance and that the aircraft was out of service until an inspection of the “hot section” of the engine could be performed. Notification of the exceedance occurred an hour after the aircraft had returned to the helibase. Pilot’s account of the incident: during the flight, I did notice that the mgt gauge flashed and then stop flashing. This can happen if the temperature reaches a warning point. Typically, the flash would be accompanied by an aural warning, however, the aircraft is not wired for the aural warning. If there is no exceedance, the gauge will then stop flashing once corrective action is taken. The gauge will also flash if an actual exceedance occurs, but then stops after a minute. Without the gauge flashing and without having seen the actual moment of exceedance, the next time the pilot has an indication is when the shuts down at the end of the flight the gauge starts to flash again. I’m assuming the exceedance occurred while drafting water or during climb out, and that I saw the last couple of flashes on the gauge. Weather started to get worse and I chose to stop water dropping ops and pick up the crew to return to helibase.  Once on the ground, I did confirm that an exceedance had occurred. Research was done to determine the next steps and the Manager was notified.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The description of the incident below was submitted to the AREP by XX XX of State Forest Service.  The incident involved 2 CL 415`s and the ATGS.  Multiple water drops were carried out that impacted State Forest Personnel on the fire.  Multiple attempts were made to stop the unsafe actions.  Narrative On 11-23-16 around 1545, the Super Scoopers began to fly low to the state fire lines and dropped a load close to the burnout operation to the north {orange circle}.  I reported this to the XX State DIVS and requested that State-XX be informed of this.  The personnel on the line were notified by radio to be heads up on other possible drops.  Around 1625, I tied in with a XX State Dozer Boss {XX} and the State-XX DIVS {designated by the State-XX Team} that we were to begin out burnout operation on the highest point possible near to where they had constructed a dozer line heading down a ridge and tying into a stream {located on the western edge of XX FS operations, denoted by an orange circle}.  At this time the main fire was within 75 yards of the state fire lines near this location.  The State Task Force began a burnout operation by tying into a dozer-constructed safety zone {for four dozers} and carrying fire to the north, away from State-XX resources.  At this time I asked DIVS Echo to inform Air Attack to not drop near the burnout operations.  I received an affirmative over the radio from DIVS Echo.  At approximately 1650, the Super Scoopers dropped two loads on the northern part of the burnout operation, impacting the two Type 6 Engines and the BRIDGE Crew.  I reported this to State DIVS Champion immediately.  Shortly thereafter, the Super Scoopers dropped very close to the State Task Force to the south, and perpendicular to the fire line.  I reported this to the State DIVS Champion immediately.  Then, the Super Scoopers dropped directly on an Oklahoma Type 6 Engine and its crew.  The crew leader informed me over the radio “They are bombing us.  Please ask them to stop”.  I reported this to State DIVS Champion and informed him that this was a No-Go situation and that I was prepared to ask XX State resources to pull off of our lines.  DIVS Champion asked that I try to contact Air Attack on my radio.  I attempted to do so on a channel that the planes and Air Attack were using.  I attempted to inform Plane XXX that drops were hitting personnel on the line.  No response was given.  I attempted to contact Air Attack that drops were hitting personnel on the line.  No response was given.  Shortly thereafter, communications between Air Attack and the plane pilots continued on that channel.  No other drops occurred near XX State personnel and around 1725, the Super Scoopers were overheard to be released from the fire.  At approximately 0100 on 11-24-16, I informed XX XX about this situation and he said that these issues would be brought to the YY State-Utah Team.  At approximately 1330 on 11-24-16 I overheard radio traffic between YY-Utah Air Attack and their ground resources on the eastern part of the fire.  Air Attack was ensuring that personnel were not close to planned drops by a helicopter.  The ground resources responded that they were clear of any drops.

After refueling in Cascade to potentially fly to Boise, our alternate landing base, we received a mission from Cascade ID BOF to deliver food to the bolder creek fire. After discussing the incoming weather with the pilot, we decided we could complete the mission as it would take us out of the area, away from tracking storm, and allow us to circum navigate to Boise from the east/southeast. After the cargo mission was completed, we flight followed with Boise dispatch and asked for a weather update for the Ola helibase, our originally destination. They advised us of the same storm and suggested we not fly to Ola helibase. After discussing this with the pilot, we both concurred that the best course of action would be to continue to circumnavigate the storm to the east/southeast and continue to Boise. As we continued to circumnavigate the storm, we received an inflight weather briefing advising us of the storm tracking over the Ola helibase/Cascade area.

We landed back at DCK @ 2022. We loaded the second load of backhaul destined for PAGA. Discussion ensued concerning fueling issues for the medium helicopter that was bringing backhaul from the fireline. Over the course of the summer helos have been using fuel stored in a park service fuel tank. Apparently fuel tracking methods are at best, marginal. The helicopter pilot was unable to get the amount of fuel needed to return to Galena. Options discussed were landing Huslia where I could deliver two barrels of fuel or landing Hog River Mine, which is 50 nm closer to DCK. I expressed concern about duty time issues with me attempting to return to Hog River, the decision was made to meet at PAHL {Huslia} with 2 barrels of fuel. As we started the 208 the helicopter was still shut down with doors open. I made three separate radio calls before takeoff: 1. “Dahl Creek traffic C-208 taxiing from the ramp for takeoff, any inbound traffic please advise.” This call is imperative as the runway cannot be seen from the ramp due to foliage/trees and vice versa. 2. “C-208 back taxi for departure to the west runway 26 Dahl Creek” 3. “C-208 rolling now runway 26 Dahl Creek departure to the West” Time noted 2042.

Helicopter support truck did have a bucket available for use. Inspection did begin after noon and the helicopter was available at 1300. In speaking with the Operations SC of the Greyrock fire, there were two options, 1. Fly one fuel cycle with the fixed tank and evaluate the need to remove the fixed tank and use bucket, or stick with the fixed tank. 2. Wait aprox 1.5 hrs for the tank to be removed and myself be in place at remote helispot to hook the bucket up to helicopter. The Pilot had some ``reservations`` about using the bucket as he hadn`t performed longline work since his carding in May of 2010. My personal feelings at the time were to support option 1. This, to me served two purposes, 1. give the pilot a good evaluation of the fire area and remote helispot, allowing some time for familliarity before immediately performing some bucket work, and 2. give the fire the support of water drops while I repositioned to hook the bucket. The fire choose to go with this option and the helicopter was launched to perform fixed tank drops and evaluate effectiveness and de-tank the aircraft for fuel cycle {{#}}2 if needed. During water dropping mission pilot made 4 drops of mixed effectiveness. The helicopter was requested to be on standby for a new start and was then sent to FNL for refueling and information on the new fire.

714,18-0274,"During PLDO operations, a feed chute blockage occurred, followed shortly by fire coming from the bottom of the exit chute. There is no clear causal connection between the two events. A PLDO trainee was operating the Premo machine, with a qualified PLDO on board to observe. The PLDO-T noticed that the second feeder chute was blocked, but the other three chutes were still feeding. After a brief discussion, it was decided to land at a nearby large meadow to investigate and resolve the blocked chute. En route to the LZ, and approximately 2-3 minutes after the block was observed, all personnel on board smelled something burning from somewhere in the machine, and the pilot could see flame coming from the bottom of the exit chute. The PLDO-T immediately applied emergency water, and the flame changed to smoke. The decision was made to continue with the plan to land at the meadow, but to shift over and land in a patch of snow. After landing, The PLDO-T removed the hopper and saw that there was no ball in the slipper block of the blocked feeder chute. The hopper was replaced and the decision was made to return to helibase to look more closely at what may have caused the fire. At helibase, the feeder chute blockage was identified as being caused by a broken sphere. Half of a sphere was pressed onto a full sphere, making it too large to pass from the chute. The needle of the blocked chute was fairly clean, while the other three needles had buildup. The needles and exit chute were flushed with water and scrubbed to remove buildup before returning to operation. The reservoir for emergency water was checked but did not need to be topped off because little water was needed to extinguish the fire. Another 2000 balls were dropped without incident.

I was parked and standing outside my vehicle in the parking area up slope from the helipad at the time the pilot released the water from his bucket.  I am certain the release of water was intentional because the water that was released came out the bottom of the bucket.  In addition to the water releasing from the bottom of the bucket, the flight path from the water source to the fire had been altered during this drop.  I had been watching the aircraft for about 45 when I watched the aircraft deviate it`s flight path towards the helibase and over top of the landing pad.  At the time of the drop I knew I was going to get wet from the water because the wind was blowing up slope towards my direction.  Although I did not receive a direct hit during the drop, it was enough where I turned my back and covered the ipad I was holding at the time of the drop.  At the time of the drop the bucket was approximately 50 feet above and approximately 50 feet down slope from my position and 100 feet above the landing pad.

At the time of dispatch H-XXX was positioned at another helibase located off HWY 16 approximately 20 miles west of Woodland, CA. The IA Fire was approximately 70 miles east near Placerville Airport {KPVF}. The contractor was equipped with a 660 gallon Bambi Bucket which is capable of being stowed on onboard while in flight. However, due to the buckets weight the pilot is incapable of unloading or loading the bucket without assistance. This creates a challenge when responding to initial attack fires when unloading assistance is not available near the fires location. Before departing the current helibase the HMGB contacted a member of a Helitack crew {HECM} who was also responding to the IA Fire and was enroute to Placerville Airport to see if they would be able to provide assistance with unloading the bucket. It was determined that the HECM would not arrive at the airport in time to assist. A call was also made to the airport itself, however KPVF had down staffed for the day. After further discussion between the HMGB and the pilot, and finding no other options that would result in H-XXX being able to take action on the fire before the end of the operational shift, the decision was made to fly with the bucket and longline deployed on the helicopter. The flight path was adjusted from a direct route to one that would take H-XXX further north of Sacramento to avoid more potential air traffic and ground structures. Ground traffic avoidance was also discussed. H-XXX then departed and responded to the IA Fire where it performed bucket work before returning to Placerville Airport at the end of the operational shift.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Mark Twain Helitack Crew and Helicopter were supporting the prescribed fire with firing operations using the Premo Mark III PSD machine. During the second set of helicopter firing operations that day, while spheres were being added to the machine from one of the refill bags, the PSD operator noticed a half sphere come out into the hopper. This can be a hazard as there have been a number of previous safecoms written where broken sphere halves have stuck to another full sphere resulting in a chute or slipper block jam {which could ultimately cause a fire in the machine}. After noticing the ball, the PSD operator removed the half broken sphere from the hopper and informed the Pilot and Firing Boss in the front of aircraft what had been observed. Together it was decided that the firing operation could continue, but that the PSD operator would take extra caution to watch for any other broken sphere halves to ensure that they could not jam the machine. This was accomplished by loading the spheres more slowly into the hopper, as to observe every sphere coming out and ensuring the proper condition of each. By the end of the mission after all the spheres had been emptied from the refill bags, no other halves were found and the mission was completed without incident.

Air Guard is receiving interference from a source in Mexico.  When this interference occurs, it is overwhelming the frequency and causes the ATGS to turn down the Guard as far as it will go.  I have noticed it periodically while working in and around Silver City, N.M. and along the Az./Mexico border of the Coronado. I thought I could program both the transmit and receive on the ATGS aircraft to minimize the impact of this interference, but found that is not possible.  I’m not sure if a software or a hardware fix is needed to allow a tone on the receive side. This interference is not constant, but is enough that you are adjusting the volume on a continual basis.FAA ASSIGNMENT OF VHF AM FREQUENCIES FOR EXTENDED ATTACK.On the merritt fire I requested and was assigned extended attack VHF frequencies for Air Tanker and helicopter use.  The frequencies assigned have been common air-to-air frequencies.  I have had interference from Tucson and Phoenix area airports, medivac flights and other private pilots using these frequencies for air-to-air use.  I asked the pilots that I happened to be flying with at the time and they said that these frequencies are common air to air frequencies for anyone to use and we have no right to tell someone to get off, it’s what the frequency is for.This is not satisfactory for our intended use.  We have to have a frequency that is ours alone.  Even if the ATGS is the only one being impacted by this interference the chance that important transmissions being blocked or walked on are too great to continue to use common air-to-air frequencies. This has the same impact as the Guard interference in that it affects the safety of air operations. The three frequencies that were assigned to me for the Merritt fire are; 123.050, 123.025, and 122.750.  All had varying degrees of interference from common air-to-air use.

The load consisted of food, water and fuel at a weight of 1945 lob, and was in a standard, 2 net daisy chain configuration. The nets were made in adherence w/IHOG policy, and were not swinging or flying irregular according to cargo personnel and pilot accounts. 3 minutes after leaving the cargo loading area, the pilot felt the load release while flying up  a drainage toward the fire location north of the helibase. Upon returning to helibase, the pilot radioed to the pad, and asked for a visual inspection of the hook before it was placed on the ground at his pad. Visual inspection of the remote hook was done by myself and chief mechanic of the aircraft. All remote hook operations (checks) were performed, and found to be operational. The keeper gate also was found to be operational, which was thought to be the cause of a previously lost load during a previous mission w/a relief pilot (7/28/03). After a discussion w/pilot, mechanic and helibase manager, trouble shooting scenarios were discussed. The remote hook in question was tested and overhauled in March of 2003, and both lost loads ((7/28 and 8/2) had been several loads into the cargo missions. Both pilots (relief 7/28 and primary 8/2) reported that hand position on the cyclic did not correlate w/an inadvertent release of the loads. Upon further discussion of both scenarios, it was stated that both loads were lost in approx. the same location from cargo area. I also showed several scenarios where cross loading of smaller diameter rings will open the keeper gate of the remote hook. At the time of this writing, a call is in to MTDC specialist (XXX XXXXX) to the likelihood of this scenario, and the remote hook has been replaced as a corrective and/or preventative measure.

804,03-1274,"						August 2, 2003To Whom It May Concern:	This letter is written to document an event involving ground resources and an airtanker.	Recently, the Pagosa Ranger District endured a lightning bust, which caused multiple ignitions over a 3-4 day period.  Precipitation on the zone contributed to a low spread potential in the fine fuels, although there was, and still is, a high probability of ignition and spread component in the heavy fuels.   	As district personnel coordinated initial attack on multiple ignitions in the Ant Hill area, with the assistance of county and local fire district resources, air attack arrived on scene.  Air attack was dispatched by Durango Interagency Dispatch Center.  Radio traffic between Durango Dispatch, air attack, and ground personnel staffing fires made radio communication difficult.  At the time, District personnel, with the assistance of county and city resources, were initial attacking three fires, one of which was East Ant Hill, located on Forest Service land.  Neither district personnel nor ground resources ordered air attack, and district personnel only realized air attack was on scene after air attack arrived and indicated the fire location.	Initial attack personnel began working on the East Ant Hill fire and determined that a tree on fire had to be felled.  Coordination had been made with the local fire department, which was taking action on a nearby fire on private land.         As all of these events were occurring, and in addition to the district answering calls from the public and dispatching resources to other fires, we overheard air attack request a heavy air tanker.  No district or ground personnel, as we discovered later, had been contacted about the retardant drop.  The IC on the ground tried to call air attack on forest net and air-to-ground, with no success.  Fire staff in the office also tried to contact air attack on forest net, with no success.  We were trying to determine air attack’s intentions, all the while trying to coordinate efforts elsewhere.During this activity, the sawyer on the East Ant Hill fire had placed a face cut on his tree, and began his back cut.  The sawyer felled the tree and began bucking up the top portion of the tree, which was on fire.  The remainder of the IA squad was clear of the felling operation, but started back to assist the feller after the tree was on the ground.  These personnel saw the sawyer drop his saw on the ground and begin to run from the area.  He commented to me that “After dropping the tree, which was on a knoll surrounded by flatter ground, he looked up and saw, at eye level, an air tanker coming in on him so he ran out of the way”.  Apparently, the air tanker pilot saw the tree fall and was able to abort the drop, even though he was on low-level approach.  If the drop had occurred minutes/seconds earlier, the pilot would not have seen the sawyer under the tree.  With the tree already being cut, the retardant drop could have caused the tree to fall in a direction other than the intended lay, which could have caused serious injury, or worse, to the sawyer and/or other crewmembers.  Later, it was determined that part of the retardant drop was intended for a fire on private land, which consisted of a burning fence post.  The local fire department did not want retardant applied on private land.  The other target was the East Ant Hill fire.  However, the IC was not aware that retardant would be dropped on this fire. The following day, immediate action was taken by the Forest and District FMO.  A detailed, formal After Action Review is planned.  Issues that need to be addressed include;1.   The forest radio system easily becoming overloaded with traffic, and poor performance of the radio system overall, especially during inclement weather.2.	Personnel not directly working local fires saturating the forest net with conversation.3.	Air resources arriving on scene and executing actions without first contacting ground forces or district fire staff.4.	Multiple decision makers, both in the air and at Durango Dispatch Center, who are unaware of local weather, a fire’s resistance to control efforts, resources in the local area, or local coordination with private landowners and local fire departments.5.	Lack of adherence to LCES.  If communication is not established with ground resources, or at a minimum with district fire staff, all actions should cease.

805,05-0384,"On shut-down from the first fuel cycle of bucket work on the fire, I exited the left seat and visually checked the left side of the aircraft for any leaks. The co-pilot exited the right seat. Since the fire was still active and more bucket work was needed, I did not open any cowlings, as we frequently do when we shut down this model helicopter for refueling. I then went to the right side of the aircraft to monitor refueling. Some time during the refueling procedure, the co-pilot opened the left side engine cowl and left it open. After the refueling was complete, I checked the fuel cap, looked at the right side of the aircraft for any leaks and asked the co-pilot if he was ready to go. He indicated he was ready to go, so I walked around the nose of the aircraft and climbed in the left door to strap in the left seat for the start. The co-pilot strapped in the right seat. The left side lower engine cowl, when open, cannot be seen from the front door without stepping away from the aircraft a few steps, which I had not done. After a normal start, we lifted off and proceeded toward the fire, about 4 miles away, to resume bucket work. Firefighters on the ground called on the radio and informed us that there was an open cowl. Apparently, the co-pilot had forgotten about the open cowl until the radio call was received. I immediately landed, inspected the cowl to make sure it was not damaged, secured it and then uneventfully continued the mission. As pilot-in-command, I did not adhere to a vital safety precept that I usually use, which is: Always make one quick walk-around inspection around the whole helicopter prior to climbing in to start it. Deficient communication and inadequate Crew Resource Management (CRM) between the pilot and co-pilot also contributed to this incident. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

832,13-0702,"Near mid-air report: 7 August, time 1855, left downwind runway 35 at 1,000 feet AGL, at the Airport.  Aircraft involved were Lead “A” and Air Attack “B” both working fires near the airport.  Estimated near miss separation distance was 100 to 200feet.  Narrative: There were two Initial Attack fires in close proximity - Fire “AA”, less than 1 Nautical Mile {NM} east of the Airport using 2 SEATs, 1 T2 Helicopter, 2 State DC-7’s, with Aerial Support provided by Lead “A” and Air Attack “A”.  The second Fire “BB” was 7 NM northwest of the Airport using 1 SEAT, 3 Heavy Air-tankers with Aerial Support provided by Lead “B” and Air Attack “B”.  Each Fire Traffic Area {FTA} had its own distinct Air-Air VHF frequency assigned.  Additional “non-players” to the FTA and airport traffic pattern, at about the time of incident, were a medevac helicopter {Life-Link} enroute to the hospital and an unannounced Type1 Helicopter prepositioning to the airport.  The FTA pattern for Fire AA was exactly coincident with a left traffic pattern for runway 35 at the airport.  Both Leads A and B were periodically monitoring each respective VHF frequencies.  Lead B coordinated with Lead A on how to sequence Fire BB’s SEAT aircraft into the airport traffic pattern to Load retardant and Return to the fire.  Lead A directed a standard Left downwind entry to runway 35 at or below 4,300 feet: which was 500feet below the flight pattern Lead A was flying on Fire AA.  This was working well with the SEAT from Fire BB.  At approximately 1845 Air Attack B left Fire BB for a fuel stop at the airport. He flew 10 NW to the west of the airport and turned back east to set up for landing.  Air Attack B contacted Air Attack A to advise of intentions to enter Fire AA’s FTA and land at the airport.  Air Attack A acknowledged that Air Attack B was inbound for the airport to get fuel.  There was no acknowledgement from Air Attack B that he had received the transmission from Air Attack A.  At that time Air Attack A was sending the acknowledgement, Air Attack B was picking up the call from the inbound Life-Link on Unicom and was concerned for his safety inbound to Fire AA’s FTA.  Radio traffic was very heavy at the time. Air Attack A assumed that Air Attack B would switch to Unicom and that all aircraft were monitoring that frequency.  Lead A was unaware Air Attack B was inbound for fuel because he was monitoring both FTA VHF frequencies and not Unicom.  In hindsight, the communication loop was not completely closed between the two Air Attacks: however Air Attack B switched over to Unicom and announced intentions to join the airport traffic pattern.  At approximately 1855 both Lead A and Air Attack B unknowingly converged and saw each other in very close proximity on a Left downwind for runway 35 at 4,700-4,800 MSL.  It was the classic high wing below and low wing above pass over where both aircraft took evasive action. Both pilots in Lead A do not recall getting a separate TCAS advisory on Air Attack B.

I was the last airtanker to depart the airport due to refueling.  I could tell from the radio traffic that the situation was confused.  I flew to the inactive side of the fire to hold.  I orbited on the east side until I thought I was nearing my turn to drop.  I proceeded to the west side of the fire and approached the area where the other airtankers were working.  After a short time I decided to exit the area once again due to the difficulity in distinquishing aircraft from all the emergency vehicles on the ground with their beacons on and rotating.  At this point the leadplane called for the tanker to the south to come in for a drop.  As I was south and going south I thought it meant it was my turn.  I started following the leadplane only to look up and see another tanker closing rapidly with me.  It was apparent it was his turn not mine.  I immediately broke hard right to avoid a mid-air collision.  This forced me into rising terrain.  I should have dumped my load and proceeded to the airport to help clear the conjection over the fire.  Instead I saved the load and eventually did drop before returning to Stead.  There were numerous factors that lead to an ever increasingly dangerous scenario.  They were increasing darkness, smoke, the close proximity of the fire to the airport, the large number of aircraft on the fire, the insufficient altitude of the air attack aircraft, the lack of an understood tanker sequence, no overall aircraft control, no holding instructions with assigned altitudes, failure of all participants to call off the operation, and a general panic situation exerting undue influence to act.

When we arrived on scene Air Attack was over head and briefed us that the Scoopers X and Y were also working in the same area and that H-XXX a CH-47 would be joining us.  He briefed us about the Scoopers flight path, their check points, as well as the dip site (Castaic Lake) and the check point (Wires Check) we would be using.  We had flown in Div A several times and were familiar with the routes and checkpoints.  After several drops working with the Scoopers and helicopter, air attack announced that he would be departing and that it would be 10-15 minutes before the replacement air attack got on station.  The outgoing air attack checked with the scoopers and both helicopters working in Div A about their comfort level working together without air attack overhead.  All were ok with it and continued operating.  The outgoing air attack had mentioned he had an inbound tanker but the tanker was instructed to hold until the new air attack got into place and the new air attack would direct the tanker.  
We made a couple drops and we had noticed the tanker holding above the fire.  Inbound to the drop when we announced “Wires Check” I noticed the tankers holding pattern had shifted slightly.  We continued inbound and tried to raise air attack.  We got no response from air attack and started to turn out from the area checking the tankers flight path.  The Tanker began turning in our direction and we noticed on our ADS-B traffic display that the tanker was descending and coming in over the top of us.  We continued our altered flight path and watched the tanker continue onto the drop in the same vicinity that we had been dropping water.  A few moments later being downwind of the flight path we encountered the wake turbulence from the tanker.  We again tried to reach air attack but weren’t able to make contact.  
Checking that the area was clear we continued to the drop and returned to the dip site.  We notified the scoopers and H-XXX to be on the look out and that we had a tanker drop nearby that was unannounced.  After getting another bucket and checking in at the “Wire Check” we were finally able to reach air attack and he briefed us that he had another tanker on the drop and to hold.
We briefed the air attack that the previous tanker was brought in without our knowledge and we needed positive communication if tankers were going to be working in the same area.  He responded that we had stepped on him when he made the call.
The new air attack had mentioned several times over the radio that this was his first time on the fire, he did not get a good transition, and had got a late dispatch to the incident.  
The only instruction we got from air attack was to stay at our below 5000 ft.  
Helicopters operate low to the ground especially in the dip sites and can’t always receive radio transmissions in the low canyon dip sites.  Air Attack may have made a call for us to hold at the Wires Check but we didn’t receive it.  Hold instructions need to be confirmed by the aircraft required to hold.

During the first bucket drop with an uphill approach, the pilot grazed the top of a Ponderosa pine that was roughly 60 ft. tall with the side of the bucket. When bucket operations commenced ground personnel moved away from the line and were congregated in an open area in view of the pilot. From this location, the hand crew that was assigned to the fire also observed the strike.   During the approach, primary ground contact and pilot believed bucket would pass over the treetop. However, firefighter further downhill saw that contact was possible from their angle of observation but did not interject. When the strike occurred, primary contact saw the strike and made the call out but the pilot had already realized the issue and pulled up and to clear the tree.  The pilot returned to the dip site, contacted the manager and the bucket was inspected for any damage.

It was landed immediatly and a Idaho Helicopters mechanic was flown over and changed out the filter. N3310 was put back in service after a check with Jim Morrison and dispatched to the Massacre Rocks fire. No further problems until today 6/27/99 and 5.8 flight hrs. later. At 1300 hrs. N3310 had another fuel filter light. Mechanic for the company was in the area and was soon there. It was suspected that the pressure differential mechanism on the fuel filter was faulty as fuel samples out of the truck and helicopter appeared clear and bright. Mechanic had brought along a different whole fuel filter assembly and changed it out. Fuel samples out of truck and helicopter again checked and appeared good. Mechanic was suspicious of fuel in the filter cannistor, however outside the filter. N3310 was test flown and then fuel was sampled directly out of the filter. It appeared clear and bright. As this was going on N351WM had fueled from his truck and went to do tank work. After one drop he also had a fuel filter light and came back to helibase and shut down. N3310 was put back in service and flew about one hr. and fifteen minutes at which time he had another filter light and came back in and shut down. It became very apparent that both ships had been contaminated. They had each fueled out of their own trucks the whole time. It appears that both trucks, being set up the same, had done the same thing. Beyond the filter at the hose reel there is a grease zerk that was greased on HT 20 (for 310) at a previous time and on HT 10 (for 351WM) this morning. Somehow this allowed grease into the fuel hose, thus into the aircraft fuel tank and fuel system. One sample of fuel was intentionaly contaminated with grease and allowed to set for a couple of hours. After that time grease could obviously be seen in btm. of the jar. After second light on 310 I was unable to contact R-4 inspector or H.O.S. but did talk to C.O.R. and told him what had been done and we agreed to put helicopter back in service. Now F.S. and O.A.S. tech. reps are fully informed of both helicopters out of service. Awaiting fix to the problem.

Sierra ECC advised the GACC of the relief required over Musick Incident.  South Zone GACC ordered SNF ECC to send them and they would replace AA-07 with another Air Attack.  Air Operations Director was never consulted and the replacement air attack did not arrive for approximately 40 minutes which forced Air Attack 430 to exceed the 7 hour CDF flight time policy limitation by about 13 minutes.  Personnel assigned on Division U were at a critical support both for communications and for retardant drops which AA-430 canceled due to lack of aerial supervision.  430 grounded fixed wings and returned to Fresno.  AA-430 had Helicopter Coordinator launched to supervise rotor wing until AA-410 arrived. While the need for an air attack was evident for the Creek Incident, and the diversion of the AA-07 solved that problem it caused a situation where aviation management was compromised over the Musick Incident. It is unknown as to the time that the Air Attack order was received by the GACC for the Creek Incident. It is unknown whether AA-410 could have been sent directly to that incident even though it was farther (approx. 15 minutes more flight time) to the Creek Incident than the Fresno based AA-07.  This would have possibly avoided the situation.  Rarely does the South Operations consult with or check with incident management personnel before they move assigned aircraft around to meet other incident needs or to anticipate the negative outcomes of those decisions.

They were repositioned by contract personnel via vehicle tow. An adiditonal SEAT remained in the lower loading pit, which allowed room to accommodate the passing of The Large Airtanker. The Large Airtanker arrived at the Tanker Base at approximately 1250 PDT. They contacted the ramp and were instructed that a marshaller would direct them on the taxiway to the upper loading pit. The Large Airtanker successfully made it past T-XX. There were two SEATs and a C-182 parked in the East-side tie-down area, to the left of Large Airtanker. This created a situation that caused the Large Airtanker to taxi well to right of the taxiway centerline to avoid the parked aircraft. Because they were so far to the right of the taxiway, the Large Airtanker`s right main landing gear wheels had traveled off the tarmac and the pilot adjusted the aircraft back onto the tarmac. The pilots’ attention was also focused on the taxiway light pylons as there was some concern that the right outboard propeller might strike one of these.

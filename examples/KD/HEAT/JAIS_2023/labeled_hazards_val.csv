With minimal radio chatter they set up safety fences and routes for several aircraft in less than prime conditions so that all could maintain operations with very minor delays in any action. I fully understand that this cannot happen all the time but I am seeing a trend by all lead and bravo assets to allow at least the heli- tankers to stay more involved rather than holding someplace else when conditions allow this to happen.

It was determined that you could operate as long as no one was in the left front seat and a 30 gallon fuel reserve was maintained. Mission went foreword with out incident however I have real concerns about the IR mounting system which is a temporary mount: 1) It obviously makes a significant change in aircraft CG and reduces the amount of useable fuel (this mission was flown by a light-weight pilot and I'm not aware of any lighter pilots, a heavier pilot may not have been able to complete this mission). 2) The ground clearance of the camera is approximately 4 inches. This is ok if your operating from a cement pad as this mission was but would be unworkable on most fires or other field operations. 3) No agency personnel were on this flight but on some IR missions it may be desirable.

Helicopter support truck did have a bucket available for use. Inspection did begin after noon and the helicopter was available at 1300. In speaking with the Operations SC of the Greyrock fire, there were two options, 1. Fly one fuel cycle with the fixed tank and evaluate the need to remove the fixed tank and use bucket, or stick with the fixed tank. 2. Wait aprox 1.5 hrs for the tank to be removed and myself be in place at remote helispot to hook the bucket up to helicopter. The Pilot had some ``reservations`` about using the bucket as he hadn`t performed longline work since his carding in May of 2010. My personal feelings at the time were to support option 1. This, to me served two purposes, 1. give the pilot a good evaluation of the fire area and remote helispot, allowing some time for familliarity before immediately performing some bucket work, and 2. give the fire the support of water drops while I repositioned to hook the bucket. The fire choose to go with this option and the helicopter was launched to perform fixed tank drops and evaluate effectiveness and de-tank the aircraft for fuel cycle {{#}}2 if needed.

I tried a few other frequencies then dispatch did hear me on the state repeater, by then we had established VHF-AM radio communication with Air Tactical and the 4 other Helicopters on the fire. Traffic was getting congested so we landed at the Fire Helibase and found a receive tone programmed into the Direct Frequency we were trying to use in the radio.

72,06-0615,"On July 8th, 2006 at aprox 1450 hrs, Central Nevada Dispatch called and informed us that T-xxx, a severity SEAT based at the Severity SEAT Base, was inbound for a load/return to the fire. Dispatch informed us that this SEAT was loaded with foam and had been unable to locate the fire and now was low on fuel and needed to jettison the load and land at BAM to refuel and reload with retardant. This aircraft (and regular Pilot) had initially been into BAM AAB and received an aircraft and vehicle use inspection and pilot briefing per Interagency policy. Prior to this aircraft’s arrival at BAM on 7/8, He was observed on AFF flying to a couple of locations quite a ways from each other. The Base Mgr. called Dispatch back to determine the true nature of T-xxx’s mission. It was then learned that T-xxx had in fact been dispatched to a fire and had been the unfortunate victim of a WILDCAD mix-up and was vainly searching an area, far from the true location of the fire, long enough he was now low on fuel. The Base then unsuccessfully attempted to contact T-xxx on the National Air Tanker Base Freq of 123.975 in order to relay the Jettison Area lat/long. A quick check of AFF found him just ESE of the airport, the base staff continued to attempt to contact him and was just about to call him on the District FM freq when he was observed jettisoning his load at the mouth of Hilltop Canyon. As this is a seasonal waterway and not the approved jettison area the Base Mgr. called the Severity Seat Base and spoke with the SEMG who said the pilot was a level II relief pilot, not the regular pilot, and had in fact been briefed, as per policy, but had never been in to BAM. (Also learned in later conversation with the pilot was the fact that he had only performed aprox 20 actual fire drops in his career and was a little apprehensive about his performance. This would factor in to the reason the Base Mgr. chose to discuss the intended mission with the Smokejumper spotter.) Interagency policy states that the first time during the season a tanker pilot arrives at a Large Tanker Base he will shut down his aircraft and receive a briefing from the base staff. This was the main reason this aircraft was shut down and the pilot given a briefing. Several other factors were starting to point to the need to ensure this pilot got a thorough Base briefing. A quick list of those factors were: No contact on the National Tanker Base frequency 123.975, either when inbound or on the ground; No knowledge of our jettison procedures or location; (ie; not dropping over waterways, lakes, etc…) No knowledge of BAM Ramp Procedures; Confusion surrounding the actual location of the fire. During the time that T-xxx was getting fueled the Base Mgr. was in contact with Dispatch to determine the correct lat/long, later confirmed with the pilot. While in contact with Dispatch, he also learned that a load of jumpers had been unable to jump the same fire due to erratic winds over the jump site, and that the jumpship was also inbound for fuel and would then be headed back to the Bone Fire to staff it. The Base Mgr. decided that this was a good opportunity to touch base with the jumpship spotter, who had ordered the SEAT, and really nail down the plan for the retardant mission for the new pilot, as well as discuss the winds encountered over the fire. This was accomplished and T-xxx was returned to the retardant rotation.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

91,17-0457,"Retardant crew was loading a P2V airtanker in pit 2 when a SEAT came into pit 1 for hot load. The crew began loading the SEAT using the SEAT loading pump. This left one MXMS at the meter stand watching two meter displays while the other MXMS ran the engine driven SEAT pump. In the middle of both loading operations the retardant density on the SEAT meter suddenly increased and loading became sluggish. At nearly the same time the loader on the P2V announced that loading was sluggish as it appeared that the pump kept quitting. The MXMS at the meter tried to discover why there seemed to be an obstruction to the water flow and tried working valves etc. There seemed to be some confusion about why both loading operations were experiencing problems so the base manager radioed to the MXMS to discontinue loading the P2V and concentrate on what was wrong with the SEAT operation. All attempts to regain water by valve switching proved ineffective and the SEAT load was discontinued at 6875 lbs by the meter although visually short of a load. The SEAT then returned to the fire. Loading the P2V was restarted and without the noise of the running SEAT it was obvious now that the main pump was indeed running but experiencing the same sluggishness with an apparent loss of water. The tank light system immediately indicated with a red light that 2082 was reached and the loader stopped the pump. An aircrew member told the loader to “ignore the lights” and continue loading. The pump was restarted but still producing little flow and elevated density at the meter. So loading was discontinued at 18,065 lbs at the meter while the aircrew indicated full load had not been reached. The P2V returned to the fire. After both aircraft had left the base it was discovered that the water supply valve had not been open and the water tank had run dry. The valve was opened and the water tank began to recover. When the SEAT returned to reload, the SEAT loading pump would not recover a prime against the check valves and a decision was made in conference with the pilot to load using the main pump as it would have enough “pull” to recover a flow.

He made a call to the manager on the fire and said that he had felt something strange when he released the water but that the bucket was still in place. The decision was to land the helicopter and inspect the bucket. Upon inspection it was confirmed that the primary release wire on the Bambi Bucket (model 1214 / 144 gallon) had sheered. The bucket was replaced with the secondary Bambi bucket carried on the fuel truck and the mission continued. Later upon further inspection of the bucket it was determined that the cable had gotten pinched between the pulley and the bracket holding the pulley. This did not allow for the control head to retract the cable, thus exerting intense force on the cable and the cable broke. The bucket was relatively new with only a couple seasons of use. No one was injured, and the last load of water carried by the bucket released from the bucket prior to the cable breaking (thus there was not an unexpected release of water from the bucket).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

108,18-0274,"During PLDO operations, a feed chute blockage occurred, followed shortly by fire coming from the bottom of the exit chute. There is no clear causal connection between the two events. A PLDO trainee was operating the Premo machine, with a qualified PLDO on board to observe. The PLDO-T noticed that the second feeder chute was blocked, but the other three chutes were still feeding. After a brief discussion, it was decided to land at a nearby large meadow to investigate and resolve the blocked chute. En route to the LZ, and approximately 2-3 minutes after the block was observed, all personnel on board smelled something burning from somewhere in the machine, and the pilot could see flame coming from the bottom of the exit chute. The PLDO-T immediately applied emergency water, and the flame changed to smoke. The decision was made to continue with the plan to land at the meadow, but to shift over and land in a patch of snow. After landing, The PLDO-T removed the hopper and saw that there was no ball in the slipper block of the blocked feeder chute. The hopper was replaced and the decision was made to return to helibase to look more closely at what may have caused the fire. At helibase, the feeder chute blockage was identified as being caused by a broken sphere. Half of a sphere was pressed onto a full sphere, making it too large to pass from the chute. The needle of the blocked chute was fairly clean, while the other three needles had buildup. The needles and exit chute were flushed with water and scrubbed to remove buildup before returning to operation. The reservoir for emergency water was checked but did not need to be topped off because little water was needed to extinguish the fire. Another 2000 balls were dropped without incident. On this PLDO operation, a total of 11,000 spheres were dropped. An unusually large amount of ethylene glycol spray was found on the skids and back to the horizontal stabilizer. A previous prescribed fire on the unit had similar results, and with the needles being wet at the area of injection. The spheres used for both projects were from the same cache shipment.

The description of the incident below was submitted to the AREP by XX XX of State Forest Service.  The incident involved 2 CL 415`s and the ATGS.  Multiple water drops were carried out that impacted State Forest Personnel on the fire.  Multiple attempts were made to stop the unsafe actions.  Narrative On 11-23-16 around 1545, the Super Scoopers began to fly low to the state fire lines and dropped a load close to the burnout operation to the north {orange circle}.  I reported this to the XX State DIVS and requested that State-XX be informed of this.  The personnel on the line were notified by radio to be heads up on other possible drops.  Around 1625, I tied in with a XX State Dozer Boss {XX} and the State-XX DIVS {designated by the State-XX Team} that we were to begin out burnout operation on the highest point possible near to where they had constructed a dozer line heading down a ridge and tying into a stream {located on the western edge of XX FS operations, denoted by an orange circle}.  At this time the main fire was within 75 yards of the state fire lines near this location.  The State Task Force began a burnout operation by tying into a dozer-constructed safety zone {for four dozers} and carrying fire to the north, away from State-XX resources.  At this time I asked DIVS Echo to inform Air Attack to not drop near the burnout operations.  I received an affirmative over the radio from DIVS Echo.  At approximately 1650, the Super Scoopers dropped two loads on the northern part of the burnout operation, impacting the two Type 6 Engines and the BRIDGE Crew.  I reported this to State DIVS Champion immediately.  Shortly thereafter, the Super Scoopers dropped very close to the State Task Force to the south, and perpendicular to the fire line.  I reported this to the State DIVS Champion immediately.  Then, the Super Scoopers dropped directly on an Oklahoma Type 6 Engine and its crew.  The crew leader informed me over the radio “They are bombing us.  Please ask them to stop”.  I reported this to State DIVS Champion and informed him that this was a No-Go situation and that I was prepared to ask XX State resources to pull off of our lines.  DIVS Champion asked that I try to contact Air Attack on my radio.  I attempted to do so on a channel that the planes and Air Attack were using.  I attempted to inform Plane XXX that drops were hitting personnel on the line.  No response was given.  I attempted to contact Air Attack that drops were hitting personnel on the line.  No response was given.  Shortly thereafter, communications between Air Attack and the plane pilots continued on that channel.  No other drops occurred near XX State personnel and around 1725, the Super Scoopers were overheard to be released from the fire.  At approximately 0100 on 11-24-16, I informed XX XX about this situation and he said that these issues would be brought to the YY State-Utah Team.  At approximately 1330 on 11-24-16 I overheard radio traffic between YY-Utah Air Attack and their ground resources on the eastern part of the fire.  Air Attack was ensuring that personnel were not close to planned drops by a helicopter.  The ground resources responded that they were clear of any drops.

148,07-0158,"During PSD operations, a couple of issues arose will on an Rx Burn on the Angelina N.F. The first issue was during a 2 hour fuel cycle of firing operations. The PLDO had to be prompted by both the pilot and the Ignitions specialist to verify that he had complied with the orders of the ignitions specialist, such as, “ready to start: start firing # chutes and speed: and to stop firing. The PLDO had to be prompted to reply back the orders given so the ignition specialist knew when the machine was firing and when it was cleared. Also sometime during this same flight the PLDO vomited into the hopper of the psd machine and did not tell anyone. The pilot had viewed thru his cargo mirror that something else was coming out of the chute of the psd machine, but didn’t know what it was. He asked the PLDO, ''What is going on with the (psd) machine?'' The PLDO didn’t respond. The pilot repeated the question, the PLDO this time didn’t respond with a realistic answer. When asked again, the PLDO then said he was “putting some water thru the machine”. The machine appeared to be working properly as the pilot could still see the spheres dropping and he decided they could finish ignitions. The PLDO didn’t inform anyone of the situation until they had landed back at the helispot. The pilot later informed me (HELM), that for a second that he thought it might have been smoke or something coming out of the chute, but with nothing being reported by the PLDO of a malfunction or jam he continued with operations. My concern is that no matter what the situation is or how embarrassing it may be, the pilot and aircrew need to be informed. The pilot has many responsibilities and needs to be paying attention to flying the helicopter. If the pilots'' attention is directed at something else rather than flying the aircraft, something is wrong. Here the pilot is trying to decipher confusing information that should have been clear and concise, which took away from the pilot’s concentration of flying that aircraft in a flight profile that is low and slow, even if it only was for a few moments. Finally, if the PLDO is getting sick than they are not functioning at 100%. If their attention isn’t on the psd machine and the firing operations. There is a chance that something could go wrong and not know it because they are concentrating more on not getting sick than doing their job. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They were repositioned by contract personnel via vehicle tow. An adiditonal SEAT remained in the lower loading pit, which allowed room to accommodate the passing of The Large Airtanker. The Large Airtanker arrived at the Tanker Base at approximately 1250 PDT. They contacted the ramp and were instructed that a marshaller would direct them on the taxiway to the upper loading pit. The Large Airtanker successfully made it past T-XX. There were two SEATs and a C-182 parked in the East-side tie-down area, to the left of Large Airtanker. This created a situation that caused the Large Airtanker to taxi well to right of the taxiway centerline to avoid the parked aircraft.

There are some very valuable lessons learned within this Safecom.I was on standby in Grand Junction acting as ATP (Air Tactical Pilot.) It was the end of the standby shift and we had just finished plugging the aircraft with intake plugs, pitot covers and prop stops. I was inside the cabin when ramp manager approached with a dispatch to a fire. The mechanic that is always with the aircraft, standing outside, said that he would unplug the aircraft while I stayed inside the plane. I watched him as he traveled around the airplane grabbing the plugs and other equipment. I watched as he placed the bag of items unplugged into the plane. The cockpit checklist was complete up to engine start and started the right engine. The ATS (Air Tactical Supervisor) yelled stop engine, which I did. At the same time I noticed the ramp manager giving the stop engine sign. There was still and engine plug in the intake of the engine. There was no damage caused, as there were only one or two revolutions of the prop before the cut sign was given (no engine light off). A complete walk around was performed and a restart was done after another complete checklist was completed. Engine was started with no mishap.As embarrassing as this is for me, there are several lessons learned here that I would like to comment on.1.	As pilot in command I should have been the person to remove all the plugs from the aircraft. The PIC is responsible for the pre-flight of the aircraft. It would have only taken me but a few seconds to perform the task and ensure of a proper preflight. This is a classic example of “complacency.”2.	The use of ramp managers and other personnel such as them are invaluable to the safety of the aircraft and the crews in and around them.3.	This situation shouts CRM. In the many years of aerial fire fighting, I have had several ground personnel come up to me and point out things on the aircraft that they had a question about. 90% of the time it was something if importance. The ATS was watching the ramp manager as I was looking at the flight panel. Using the two-crew members in the ASM role caught the engine stop signal way before I would have if it had been a single pilot operation.Job well done on the part of Ramp Manager, because of his actions, we didn’t cause any damage to the aircraft and were able to continue with the mission.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

During the second set of helicopter firing operations that day, while spheres were being added to the machine from one of the refill bags, the PSD operator noticed a half sphere come out into the hopper. This can be a hazard as there have been a number of previous safecoms written where broken sphere halves have stuck to another full sphere resulting in a chute or slipper block jam {which could ultimately cause a fire in the machine}. After noticing the ball, the PSD operator removed the half broken sphere from the hopper and informed the Pilot and Firing Boss in the front of aircraft what had been observed. Together it was decided that the firing operation could continue, but that the PSD operator would take extra caution to watch for any other broken sphere halves to ensure that they could not jam the machine. This was accomplished by loading the spheres more slowly into the hopper, as to observe every sphere coming out and ensuring the proper condition of each. By the end of the mission after all the spheres had been emptied from the refill bags, no other halves were found and the mission was completed without incident.

177,16-0816,"On August 6th Helicopter -XXX, an exclusive use type 1 helicopter {Kaman K-1200,} was dispatched to the a fire on the Eldorado National Forest for Initial Attack. At the time of dispatch H-XXX was positioned at another helibase located off HWY 16 approximately 20 miles west of Woodland, CA. The IA Fire was approximately 70 miles east near Placerville Airport {KPVF}. The contractor was equipped with a 660 gallon Bambi Bucket which is capable of being stowed on onboard while in flight. However, due to the buckets weight the pilot is incapable of unloading or loading the bucket without assistance. This creates a challenge when responding to initial attack fires when unloading assistance is not available near the fires location. Before departing the current helibase the HMGB contacted a member of a Helitack crew {HECM} who was also responding to the IA Fire and was enroute to Placerville Airport to see if they would be able to provide assistance with unloading the bucket. It was determined that the HECM would not arrive at the airport in time to assist. A call was also made to the airport itself, however KPVF had down staffed for the day. After further discussion between the HMGB and the pilot, and finding no other options that would result in H-XXX being able to take action on the fire before the end of the operational shift, the decision was made to fly with the bucket and longline deployed on the helicopter. The flight path was adjusted from a direct route to one that would take H-XXX further north of Sacramento to avoid more potential air traffic and ground structures. Ground traffic avoidance was also discussed. H-XXX then departed and responded to the IA Fire where it performed bucket work before returning to Placerville Airport at the end of the operational shift.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

180,02-0114,"I have the radio interference report form and will fill that out as well and forward on through our Forest radio techs.Please pass on to SWCC Coordinator as I have discussed these problems with him.AIR GUARD INTERFERENCE ALONG THE MEXICO BOARDER. Air Guard is receiving interference from a source in Mexico.  When this interference occurs, it is overwhelming the frequency and causes the ATGS to turn down the Guard as far as it will go.  I have noticed it periodically while working in and around Silver City, N.M. and along the Az./Mexico border of the Coronado. I thought I could program both the transmit and receive on the ATGS aircraft to minimize the impact of this interference, but found that is not possible.  I’m not sure if a software or a hardware fix is needed to allow a tone on the receive side. This interference is not constant, but is enough that you are adjusting the volume on a continual basis.FAA ASSIGNMENT OF VHF AM FREQUENCIES FOR EXTENDED ATTACK.On the merritt fire I requested and was assigned extended attack VHF frequencies for Air Tanker and helicopter use.  The frequencies assigned have been common air-to-air frequencies.  I have had interference from Tucson and Phoenix area airports, medivac flights and other private pilots using these frequencies for air-to-air use.  I asked the pilots that I happened to be flying with at the time and they said that these frequencies are common air to air frequencies for anyone to use and we have no right to tell someone to get off, it’s what the frequency is for.This is not satisfactory for our intended use.  We have to have a frequency that is ours alone.  Even if the ATGS is the only one being impacted by this interference the chance that important transmissions being blocked or walked on are too great to continue to use common air-to-air frequencies. This has the same impact as the Guard interference in that it affects the safety of air operations. The three frequencies that were assigned to me for the Merritt fire are; 123.050, 123.025, and 122.750.  All had varying degrees of interference from common air-to-air use.

A precautionary landing was initiated when the aircraft cabin and the fire crew in the rear of the aircraft were exposed to a strong burning odor and fumes from an overheated fan blower motor.The aircraft was held on the pad at BOI for an extended period to allow for air tanker traffic on several large fires nearby.  The pilot turned on the fan blower to provide air circulation for the rear flight crew.  Prior to departure, the pilot shut off the ICS system to the rear of the aircraft.  BOI Tower and Approach were both very busy with the Air Tanker Traffic and the pilot wanted to keep a 'sterile cockpit' in his departure from the airport.  Approximately 4 minutes into the flight, the Fan Blower Motor for the Overhead Airduct Vent System overheated and seized, popping a circut breaker.  Heat generated by the fan blower motor generated a strong smell and fumes in the rear of the aircraft.  With the ICS system off, an inability of the rear flight crew to communicate with the pilot caused some excitement.  When the pilot turned on the ICS system, he was informed of the fumes and smoke in the rear of the aircraft.  The pilot initiated a precautionary landing in a hay pasture near an active sprinkler irrigation system.The helicopter manager exited the aircraft and checked the rear cargo compartment for signs of a fire and heat externally and then internally.

I was the last airtanker to depart the airport due to refueling.  I could tell from the radio traffic that the situation was confused.  I flew to the inactive side of the fire to hold.  I orbited on the east side until I thought I was nearing my turn to drop.  I proceeded to the west side of the fire and approached the area where the other airtankers were working.  After a short time I decided to exit the area once again due to the difficulity in distinquishing aircraft from all the emergency vehicles on the ground with their beacons on and rotating.  At this point the leadplane called for the tanker to the south to come in for a drop.  As I was south and going south I thought it meant it was my turn.  I started following the leadplane only to look up and see another tanker closing rapidly with me.  It was apparent it was his turn not mine.  I immediately broke hard right to avoid a mid-air collision.  This forced me into rising terrain.  I should have dumped my load and proceeded to the airport to help clear the conjection over the fire.  Instead I saved the load and eventually did drop before returning to Stead.  There were numerous factors that lead to an ever increasingly dangerous scenario.  They were increasing darkness, smoke, the close proximity of the fire to the airport, the large number of aircraft on the fire, the insufficient altitude of the air attack aircraft, the lack of an understood tanker sequence, no overall aircraft control, no holding instructions with assigned altitudes, failure of all participants to call off the operation, and a general panic situation exerting undue influence to act.

222,14-0812,"On the morning of September 18th, 2014 the aircraft dispatcher at LIFC called Kingsley Field Oregon Air National Guard operations to report that the Klamath Falls Air Tactical Group Supervisor {Air Attack} and Single Engine Airtankers {SEAT’s} would be operating from Burns and Lakeview in support of Bone Creek Basin and Blitzen Fires near the Steen’s mountains. Kingsley asked what the flight level for of the aircraft would be. Per the Klamath Falls Air Attack and the Lakeview SEAT Manager, the aircraft would be flying around 7,500 ft. MSL when enroute to the incident and 8,500 coming back to LKV. Kingsley said that would work for them as the floor in the MOA is 11,000. After speaking with Burns later in the morning the LIFC aircraft dispatcher found out the heavy airtankers would be flying also and relayed that to Kingsley Field. The de-confliction report that morning indicated that Juniper / Hart and Goose MOAs would be active with a floor of 11,000 feet and the following footnote **notified of heavy activity throughout day**.  At the Klamath Falls ATB {LMT}, tankers were on and available. Both aircrews were given the de-confliction information with the morning briefing materials. Both airtankers launched to the Bone Creek Basin fire at 11:30. Airtankers had already launched to the fire from RDM at 1030. It is unknown if those aircrews received de-confliction information at that time. The four airtankers proceeded to load and return from LMT. Tankers 161 and 41 did not receive deconfliction information on the MOAs from the airtanker base at this time. At 1545 the LIFC aircraft dispatch received a call from a Lt. Col from Kingsley stating there was almost an incident within the Juniper Hart MOA. He said that they didn’t know we {federal airtankers} were in there and if the tankers were flying VFR they must have been penetrating the clouds. One of the military planes got close to one of the tankers and they were concerned. The aircraft dispatcher gave the Lt Col the Klamath Falls Airtanker Base Manager’s number as well because he wanted to relay the information to them. Both aircraft dispatchers deconflicted the day prior and in the morning of the 18th.  Another phone call was made to Kingsley on the morning of the 18th to notify of the planned Air Attack flights to Burns from Klamath Falls. Kingsley was updated about the additional orders for Airtankers/SEATs that would be operating to/from Klamath Falls. The Burns Interagency Coordination Center was also notified of the military traffic in the MOA. The Klamath Falls base manager received a call from a Lt. Col. at Kingsley on the afternoon of September 18th. He was concerned that F15’s from the Kingsley base were operating in the Hart South MOA and that airtankers supporting the Bone Creek Basin and Blitzen Crossing fires were crossing the MOA at approximately 13,000 ft. He said the airtankers were “in weather” with low visibility and that there had been a instance where aircraft had been in close proximity. The Airtanker Base manager told him that he would speak to the aircrews and let them know that the MOA is active and relay his concerns. He asked the Airtanker Base manager to send him an email letting him know that he had done this. The manager spoke with each air crew that day which consisted of {3} Tankers. Tanker XXX at this time was already heading for RDM. T XX had been operating across the MOA at about 7500’ and TXX and TXXX had been operating at approximately 13,500’. The TXXX crew mentioned that they had been “on top” of weather on their way over. I told them the MOA was active and expressed the Lt. Col.’s concern. I sent an email to the Lt. Col. letting him know that I spoke with the aircrews. By this time, the airtankers were on hold. They did not go back to the fire.  In the afternoon of the 18th, after all airtankers were on hold, both the LIFC dispatch office and the LMT airtanker base received calls from Kingsley Field. They were concerned that the heavy airtankers were flying at 13,500 and in the clouds and he thought that should be an IFR flight and wasn’t sure why they were flying that high. The Assistant Tanker Base Manager was contacted by Kingsley field who reported an airtanker observed at 11,000 feet in the clouds. The Assistant Airtanker Base Manager mentioned to the officer, that de-confliction information was received and relayed to the pilots of the active MOA’s. The Assistant Airtanker Base Manager then spoke with the aircrews. The pilots stated they had already lowered their routes and had to get around the weather. The Tanker was able to lower his flight paths to 7500. A couple pilots mentioned getting T-CAS hits from jets far overhead. There were no further flights to these fires that day or after. The airtanker base has received word from the National Airspace Program Manager that the military had notified the FAA of these events. On Monday, the 29th of September, the National Airspace Program Manager called the Unit Aviation Officer asking for clarification and information about the events of September 8th, as the FAA was asking if there was a mutual agreement to fly at 7500ft.

I heard the call to the tower, on the FAA VHF frequency, possibly to get around the insterile cockpitin procedures, and disregarded it. I did not believe there was proper authority from the lead plane, I had proper dispatch from Western Slope Dispatch, Lead 7-2 was low on fuel but waiting for me, and I was already approximately 75 knots into the takeoff roll. I momentarily hesitated to abort to consider my options. Since I was under the control of the FAA at the time, and I determined that I could SAFELY abort the takeoff, I chose to abort. The takeoff was safely aborted, not for any traffic problem or mechanical problem with the aircraft. It happened the Lead 2-3 thought I was being dispatched to a fire she had been on and had left. I was in fact going to a different fire. This raises some serious safety questions. Does the lead plane have the authority to override a dispatch order? Does the lead plane have the authority to override proper orders and instructions from FAA at an FAA controlled airport? Have I relinquished my authority as pilot in command on my aircraft to the lead plane pilot? What happened to the sterile cockpit procedure? Even if I had been going to the fire that lead 2-3 was on, I feel strongly that it would have been much safer for me to continue the takeoff, get proper cancellation orders and return for landing. This precludes the necessity of making snap decisions based on the decisions made by others than the pilot in command at a critical time in the operation of the aircraft. It should be understood that this is not a personal attack on Lead 2-3. This situation may have arisen with other lead plane pilots.

Discussion ensued concerning fueling issues for the medium helicopter that was bringing backhaul from the fireline. Over the course of the summer helos have been using fuel stored in a park service fuel tank. Apparently fuel tracking methods are at best, marginal.

I expressed concern about duty time issues with me attempting to return to Hog River, the decision was made to meet at PAHL {Huslia} with 2 barrels of fuel. As we started the 208 the helicopter was still shut down with doors open. I made three separate radio calls before takeoff: 1. “Dahl Creek traffic C-208 taxiing from the ramp for takeoff, any inbound traffic please advise.” This call is imperative as the runway cannot be seen from the ramp due to foliage/trees and vice versa. 2. “C-208 back taxi for departure to the west runway 26 Dahl Creek” 3. “C-208 rolling now runway 26 Dahl Creek departure to the West” Time noted 2042.

262,13-0863,"On August 28, 2013 a cargo mission involving multiple loads delivered to multiple helispots was initiated by a handcrew’s request via cell phone to the Air Ops. At the time, the type 2 helibase had four helicopters, a USFS exclusive use AS350-B3 with crew, a National CWN 214 with a CWN crew, a National exclusive use S-61 with manager, and a National CWN UH-1H {restricted} with a manager and manager trainee. Other HECMs on base were assigned to ABRO, ABRO trainee, and cargo. Supply dropped off the cargo midafternoon and loads were built in the designated cargo area using the HOGE-J allowable from the 214’s load calc. At some point it was decided by HEB2 that the loads should be shared between the 214 and the UH-1H. Helitack in cargo divided up the loads between the two ships according to the receiving crew’s point of contact. It was determined that the 214 would deliver three loads, the UH-1H would deliver two loads, and whoever returned first would fly the last load {total of 6 picks}. The manager and pilots of the 214 were fully aware of their mission and already spooling when an individual came to the managers of the UH-1H with two pieces of paper containing a lat/long, contact, and weight for the two loads they would take. They were told each ship would fly two loads and that there was a fifth load going with the first aircraft back. The managers briefed their pilot, discussing a number of concerns, but determined that the mission could be carried out safely and that they would proceed. The first red flag was that the HECM who brought the load info from cargo did not know the weight of the last load, but that would be easily resolved with a radio call prior to the final pick, and because the 214 would be the first one out they would probably be the first back thus taking the load in question, making the concern irrelevant. The second topic of concern related to the fact that the first pick would not only be the heaviest, but its weight was actually 2 pounds above the UH-1H’s allowable for the day. It was determined that taking a load over allowable was mitigated due to the pick-up and delivery locations being much lower in elevation than the load calc was completed for coupled with fuel burn from a maintenance run-up and power check completed prior to the mission. All involved agreed the mission could be safely completed. As the 214 called deck to lift and the UH-1H began his start up, ABRO{t} called cargo asking for manifests and other info relating to the mission. A very confusing radio exchange in which cargo told the ABRO{t} “load 3 will be {{{{#}}}}1 going to ____, load 1 will be {{{{#}}}}2 going to lat/long with a contact of ___, BREAK.” At which point ABRO{t} stepped in saying “all I need to know is what is the first load out, and who is it going to so I can inform Div.___,” and to “please bring the manifests for each load to the box.” After the 4th pick, the UH-1H managers saw that there were actually six loads… not the five they were briefed about. Due to a seemingly large amount of confusion at the helibase for a simple cargo mission, the UH-1H manager decided to walk down to the box and look at the manifests and posted load calcs. He discovered a number of discrepancies in the numbers on the manifests. The allowables for all manifested loads were based off of the 214’s HOGE-J, which was 376 pounds heavier than the UH-1H’s. The manifest showed a remote hook with longline at 60 pounds, when the UH-1H hook and longline combined weight was 91 pounds. Although the cargo area was too far from their pad too see all the equipment clearly, the manager could tell each load consisted of three daisy-chained nets or blivets, which should’ve used two leadlines and three swivels. The manifests did not show the appropriate weights for that combination of equipment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

At that point H-xxx released all his water to avoid damage to his bucket and longline. The pilot noticed where he dropped his water that it was possible the water and/or his bucket may have damaged a fence. 
H-xxx immediately notified Air-Attack of what happened and finished his cycle dropping water. After tapping the fence H-xxx moved further back in the dipsite and took a little less water.

At the time this happened the ground crew was talking on the radio about a huge wind switch. At Cortez airport the winds were at 8kts gusting to 26kts reported by CEZ ASOS.

A ground crew was sent out to the dip site and did not find any damage to the fence but did find a screw that was protruding from a fence post that the bucket had scraped on. The bucket did have a light scratch, but no significant damage was done.  Pictures attached.

276,20-0449,"Dispatched out to an initial attack late in the day dropped off two personnel on the fire. Afterward, the helicopter relocated to the dip site and reconfigured for bucket operations. The manager and pilot decided to leave the cargo basket attached to the aircraft while performing bucket work instead of attempting a single person removal of the basket. During the first bucket drop with an uphill approach, the pilot grazed the top of a Ponderosa pine that was roughly 60 ft. tall with the side of the bucket. When bucket operations commenced ground personnel moved away from the line and were congregated in an open area in view of the pilot. From this location, the hand crew that was assigned to the fire also observed the strike.   During the approach, primary ground contact and pilot believed bucket would pass over the treetop. However, firefighter further downhill saw that contact was possible from their angle of observation but did not interject. When the strike occurred, primary contact saw the strike and made the call out but the pilot had already realized the issue and pulled up and to clear the tree.  The pilot returned to the dip site, contacted the manager and the bucket was inspected for any damage. Bucket strike occurred around 1920 in a narrow drainage with shadows becoming an issue for both ground observer and pilot in regard to depth perception. 

No damage to aircraft, equipment, or human life.

287,99-0052,"While performing initial attack activities on the Cypress Creek Fire, the pilot had to land at the helispot for additional fuel. Once the refueling was complete, the pilot was to return to the fire to perform bucket drops.When the pilot initiated the starting sequence, the engine failed to start. The pilot attempted a second time to start the engine and it once again failed to start. With a second failure, the pilot decided not to try again until the problem was looked at by a mechanic. At this time, I informed the pilot that I did not hear the usual 'clicking' sound that the ignitor makes on a normal start. About this time, the mechanic for a Bell 212 assigned to the fire arrived at the helispot. The pilot, which is also the owner of the aircraft, asked the mechanic to take a look at the helicopter to see if he could find out what was causing the engine not to start. The mechanic started by removing the ignitor plug to see if it might have some carbon built up on the end, not allowing it to operate properly. Once it was removed, I, along with the mechanic and the pilot, observed only a small amount of carbon deposits on the end of the ignitor. The ignitor was cleaned and replaced in the engine, and the security wire was replaced. The pilot then tried to start the engine resulting another failed start.At this time, I made a call to Region-8 maintenance inspector Bill McMillan to inform him of the situation. With very poor cellular service on my end of the call, I was able to understand him enough to hear that it was alright to proceed, but that when I was able to get to a hard line phone, I was to call him and let him know what had happened.I knew that the mechanic was not a 407 mechanic, but I did allow him to proceed because what he was doing, in my opinion, did not warrant the necessity of a 407 mechanic. I was later informed by Mr. McMillan that this should not have been allowed because the 407 is such a new type aircraft and  that with the 'FADEC' system problems that occur might not be what they seem and need to be checked out by a qualified 407 mechanic.--Lesson learned.  The mechanic then decided to try and clean the fuel nozzle to see if this would help the situation. Once this was done, another attempt was made to start the engine which proved to be successful.The helicopter started each time necessary the rest of the day without fail. The pilot/owner of the aircraft decided to fly his mechanic in to take a look at the helicopter. The mechanic was at the helibase the next morning, Wednesday, April 21. He added a shim to the fuel nozzle and checked out the aircraft.  The aircraft started without incident. A call was made to Bill McMillan to inform him of the situation.  Mr. McMillan released the aircraft for work and told me that if the problem occurred again, that I was to make the aircraft unavailable and stop it from working. Once we were released to work we were dispatched back to the fire. When the pilot tried to start the engine, it once again failed to start. When this occurred, the mechanic tried changing out the ignitor plug and adding another shim to the fuel nozzle. This proved to be ineffective.

After the cargo mission was completed, we flight followed with Boise dispatch and asked for a weather update for the Ola helibase, our originally destination. They advised us of the same storm and suggested we not fly to Ola helibase. After discussing this with the pilot, we both concurred that the best course of action would be to continue to circumnavigate the storm to the east/southeast and continue to Boise. As we continued to circumnavigate the storm, we received an inflight weather briefing advising us of the storm tracking over the Ola helibase/Cascade area.

Pilot released water from bucket to minimize roll over effect and slowly pulled up out of the dip. Pilot contacted the IC on A/G, notified him of the issue and asked if there was someone at the helispot that could remove the line from the skid.

391,01-0941,Helicopter NXXXXX showed up at Minden airport per instructions to meet up withhis Helicopter Mgr before going to the Genoa Fire which was only two miles away. No Manager was present so he contacted Minden Dispatch through the Air Tanker Base personnel and was told to proceed to the Genoa fire where his Mgr was supposed to be waiting. He proceeded to the fire and was told to go back to the airport and stand by. The fire called and said they wanted him back there so he hooked up his bucket and went to the Genoa fire where he made about 30 drops before being released back to the Minden airport. The next day he was dispatched to another USFS fire down by Markleeville and proceeded there to work the fire. He had still not hooked up with a manager as of yet and Dispatch became aware of it and sent a Manager to tie in with him at Minden Airport where he went through his briefing and had his cards checked. He continued working that fire for the rest of the day and the next day proceeded to a BLM fire where he worked the next two days without incident.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
392,05-0384,"On shut-down from the first fuel cycle of bucket work on the fire, I exited the left seat and visually checked the left side of the aircraft for any leaks. The co-pilot exited the right seat. Since the fire was still active and more bucket work was needed, I did not open any cowlings, as we frequently do when we shut down this model helicopter for refueling. I then went to the right side of the aircraft to monitor refueling. Some time during the refueling procedure, the co-pilot opened the left side engine cowl and left it open. After the refueling was complete, I checked the fuel cap, looked at the right side of the aircraft for any leaks and asked the co-pilot if he was ready to go. He indicated he was ready to go, so I walked around the nose of the aircraft and climbed in the left door to strap in the left seat for the start. The co-pilot strapped in the right seat. The left side lower engine cowl, when open, cannot be seen from the front door without stepping away from the aircraft a few steps, which I had not done. After a normal start, we lifted off and proceeded toward the fire, about 4 miles away, to resume bucket work. Firefighters on the ground called on the radio and informed us that there was an open cowl. Apparently, the co-pilot had forgotten about the open cowl until the radio call was received. I immediately landed, inspected the cowl to make sure it was not damaged, secured it and then uneventfully continued the mission. As pilot-in-command, I did not adhere to a vital safety precept that I usually use, which is: Always make one quick walk-around inspection around the whole helicopter prior to climbing in to start it. Deficient communication and inadequate Crew Resource Management (CRM) between the pilot and co-pilot also contributed to this incident. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We were down approximately 30 minutes. We left the helispot around 14:48 to finish the RX burn. We had been firing about 20 minutes when all of a sudden the machine lost power. I immediately told the ignition boss and the pilot that the machine had lost power and I was accessing the problem. I closed the feed control and turned the control panel to the off mode. I looked to make sure the power cable hadn`t come loose. Everything was connected. I started turning the manual assist to get any balls out of the exit chute. A couple of balls exited but I was having problems turning the manual assist. At that time I noticed a glow around the feed control and exit chute. I immediately pushed the water button on the control panel extinguishing the fire. At that point I told the pilot and ignition boss that I had to use water to extinguish the fire, we still had no power and we needed to go back to the helispot. We landed at the helispot at 15:25.

This occurred at the box on the helibase, about ¼ mile from the helicopter pad.

473,03-0491,"While performing a long line mission to personnel at a spike camp located near H-22 on the Farewell Fire, a daisy chained load was lost in transit. The load consisted of food, water and fuel at a weight of 1945 lob, and was in a standard, 2 net daisy chain configuration. The nets were made in adherence w/IHOG policy, and were not swinging or flying irregular according to cargo personnel and pilot accounts. 3 minutes after leaving the cargo loading area, the pilot felt the load release while flying up  a drainage toward the fire location north of the helibase. Upon returning to helibase, the pilot radioed to the pad, and asked for a visual inspection of the hook before it was placed on the ground at his pad. Visual inspection of the remote hook was done by myself and chief mechanic of the aircraft. All remote hook operations (checks) were performed, and found to be operational. The keeper gate also was found to be operational, which was thought to be the cause of a previously lost load during a previous mission w/a relief pilot (7/28/03). After a discussion w/pilot, mechanic and helibase manager, trouble shooting scenarios were discussed. The remote hook in question was tested and overhauled in March of 2003, and both lost loads ((7/28 and 8/2) had been several loads into the cargo missions. Both pilots (relief 7/28 and primary 8/2) reported that hand position on the cyclic did not correlate w/an inadvertent release of the loads. Upon further discussion of both scenarios, it was stated that both loads were lost in approx. the same location from cargo area. I also showed several scenarios where cross loading of smaller diameter rings will open the keeper gate of the remote hook. At the time of this writing, a call is in to MTDC specialist (XXX XXXXX) to the likelihood of this scenario, and the remote hook has been replaced as a corrective and/or preventative measure.

Guard copter 802 is a CH-47 with a 120’ longline attached to the bucket. The Lat/Long for the Cow Dip site is N 39 59.33 W 121 27.06.  We made contact with a tree while exiting a dip.  We were supporting fire “1-2”.  This was the second “dip” on a new fuel cycle.  Guard 802 had previously pulled 9 buckets from the this dip site on our first fuel cycle. 

The dip site is at an elevation of 6,200’.  The temperature was approximately 29 degrees.  Our speed over ground was 10 knots thus not into effective translational lift (ETL).  The bucket is a 2,000 gallon Tarantula Power-Fill Bambi bucket but was only 75% full.  We utilized the same exit path for departure from the pond each time.  The crew did not see the “snag” tree in time to jettison the water from the bucket and the bucket made contact with the top of the tree and tore a hole in the side of the bucket.  After briefing with the crew, it was determined/agreed that we did not climb enough altitude (AGL) prior to forward flight.  The tear is too large to patch and therefore out of service.  The crew of 802 did not feel anything in the aircraft when we struck the tree.  There was no other damage related to this incident.

It was landed immediatly and a Idaho Helicopters mechanic was flown over and changed out the filter. N3310 was put back in service after a check with Jim Morrison and dispatched to the Massacre Rocks fire. No further problems until today 6/27/99 and 5.8 flight hrs. later. At 1300 hrs. N3310 had another fuel filter light. Mechanic for the company was in the area and was soon there. It was suspected that the pressure differential mechanism on the fuel filter was faulty as fuel samples out of the truck and helicopter appeared clear and bright. Mechanic had brought along a different whole fuel filter assembly and changed it out. Fuel samples out of truck and helicopter again checked and appeared good. Mechanic was suspicious of fuel in the filter cannistor, however outside the filter. N3310 was test flown and then fuel was sampled directly out of the filter. It appeared clear and bright. As this was going on N351WM had fueled from his truck and went to do tank work. After one drop he also had a fuel filter light and came back to helibase and shut down. N3310 was put back in service and flew about one hr. and fifteen minutes at which time he had another filter light and came back in and shut down. It became very apparent that both ships had been contaminated. They had each fueled out of their own trucks the whole time. It appears that both trucks, being set up the same, had done the same thing. Beyond the filter at the hose reel there is a grease zerk that was greased on HT 20 (for 310) at a previous time and on HT 10 (for 351WM) this morning. Somehow this allowed grease into the fuel hose, thus into the aircraft fuel tank and fuel system. One sample of fuel was intentionaly contaminated with grease and allowed to set for a couple of hours. After that time grease could obviously be seen in btm. of the jar. After second light on 310 I was unable to contact R-4 inspector or H.O.S. but did talk to C.O.R. and told him what had been done and we agreed to put helicopter back in service.

Upon attempting to use one of the new dip sites the aircraft `turned` due to erratic winds at which point he was able to recover. Having been shaken by the event, the pilot continued to attempt approaches at other dips but had difficulties in understanding where AA wanted him to dip. Due to the misunderstanding of directions and his unease with previous events, he made the decision to return to helibase and make himself unavailable for external load missions for the remainder of the shift. Erratic winds were present along with poor visibility creating less than ideal conditions. Other aircraft/pilots were successful with the dip sites and were more familiar with the local area and conditions.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
494,12-0672,"On Saturday, 7-7-2012, an Air Attack platform arrived at the Navarre Fire at approximately 1330. We had been working this fire for two days utilizing the DNR Air-to-Ground frequency for communications during suppression activities. This air attack began using the frequency for his `In-Brief` to gather information for the fire, stating he did not have the tactical frequencies and interfered with our normal ground communications. CWICC was attempting to establish contact with him through Badger Repeater, which he did not have. The frequency was transmitted and he indicated he would program the radio. Later, when the air tankers arrived, he decided not to use their frequency but remain on the tactical DNR air-to-ground channel.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
495,00-0509,"Subject:  SAFECOM - Canadian Bird Dog#52,           Left Engine Failure.At approximately 1100 hours MDT Canadian Bird Dog#52, a Turbo Commander, departed Miles City, Montana for Helena, MT.  After reaching cruising altitude of 12,500 feet westbound, and 25 minutes out of Miles City, the left engine suddenly lost power and went to auto feather.  There were no prior indications (instrumentation) that there was a problem developing.  After a cool down period of approximately 2 minutes, and attempt to restart the engine was made but immediately aborted due to no indication of oil pressure.The aircraft was under FS flight following with Lewistown as Billings could not be raised.  Flight following and position reports were also conveyed to Helena on FS nets.The aircraft had no difficulty maintaining altitude and was operating in CAVU conditions.  The flight crew made a judgement call to continue on to Missoula where they had maintenance support even though it was somewhat further than Helena where the logistics of repair would be difficult.  This decision was based on what the flight crew believed to be inpracticablein given the circumstances of clear air, no problems in maintaining altitude, other available landing places along the route, and the availability of maintenance support in Missoula.Bird Dog #52 continued west at 12,500 feet MSL with no further difficulties, other than reduced airspeed, and maintained visuals on airports and landing area's they could reach if problems developed with the right engine.Landing was affected in Missoula at near 1200 hours where they taxied to Northstar Aviation and met with their maintenance team.  The cowling was removed, screens pulled showing a lot of evidence of metal particle, i.e., steel and brass.  The engine had failed and required an engine change.USDA Forest Service LiaisonCanadian Airtanker Deployment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

497,04-0801,"Pilot flew into a sling site to retreive backhaul. Qualified helitack (smokejumpers) hooked the load to the cargo hook. The pilot inadvertantly released the longline from the helicopter, causing it to tumble to the ground (pilot was hovering slightly uphill from personnel while hooking, so the line fell uphill) He was unable to land, so he returned to the helispot while the jumpers topped a few trees to allow him to do a hover hook up. He returned to the sling spot, the load was reattached by hover hook up and he began flying back to the helispot. One half way back, the load, longline, and hook all disconnected from the helicopter. After some searching, the load was located, the location GPSed and retreived shortly after. The pilot admitted his error in mistakenly ''''punching off the load'''' the first time while he was looking down through the bubble. He is confident that he did not ''''punch off'''' the load the second time and is unsure why it happened. After locating the load, he picked helitack up at the helispot and we returned to the airport, ending the day.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

499,03-0127,"Upon departure from 6D9 to return to CAD (home airport) after Forest detection mission, pilot observed and reported to Forest dispatch a wildfire occurring south of Sand Lake.  The fire was approximately one acre in size, burning in grass and hardwood litter.  Ausable Task Force and Pine River engine were dispatched for suppression.  Due to the inoperable radio system in using command and repeater frequencies, Huron dispatch kept the patrol plane over site of fire and relayed and received through Huron detection frequency via the pilot all communication with ground resources.  Dispatcher also communicated via cell phone with L.E.O. 3520 with very poor cell reception.  Suppression mission was accomplished, but the safety/comfort communication zone was absent, causing concern and apprehension.On Monday, April 28th, the Huron National Forest's task forces (Mio and Huron Shores) responded to six fires (including one at 531 acres, one at 150 acres and one at 50 acres) with the same communication problems and again Huron dispatch had to rely on the patrol planes (2) for communication with ground forces.  There were also fires on April 25th, 27th, and 30th with the same communication problems.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

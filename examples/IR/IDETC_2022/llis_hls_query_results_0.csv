"The terrorist attacks on September 11 emphasized the need for increased security of all national assets including NASA's computer systems. Since many of these systems safeguard the lives of astronauts and cosmonauts and the safety of valuable international assets, it is crucial that security vulnerabilities be fully understood and closely managed.Accelerate the schedule of penetration exercises to gain greater insights into computer security vulnerabilities; determine if further threat analysis should be conducted; review all vulnerabilities; and ensure that plans are adequately formulated to mitigate these vulnerabilities and that work is proceeding to prevent critical systems from being compromised. Accelerate the schedule for the implementation of triple Data Encryption System (DES).Terrorist attacks of 9/11 have reinforced the need to protect NASA network and communications resources from intrusion.The Agency and Center IT security program is a risk-based management and acceptance process. The program continues to evolve to incorporate and facilitate tools and metrics for greater insight into security vulnerabilities. Currently the Centers perform quarterly vulnerability scans and metrics that are reported to the Agency. The vulnerabilities found are reviewed and worked through a defined process. Mission Critical systems external interfaces such as those of the JSC Mission Control Center with the JSC Institutional Network are included in these quarterly assessments. We will continue to work to improve this process and capability as new technologies and tools become available. The change to incorporate the triple DES has been negotiated with the contractor; a probabilistic risk assessment associated with losing S-band communications is being conducted prior to Program implementation."

"NASA has initiated an agency-wide program to deal with general computer security. Significant parts of NASA's initial plan depend upon the voluntary compliance of system users including contractors.Expand the agency-wide security system development work to include less dependence on human compliance with the system. NASA should also require contractors to participate in its security efforts.Implementation of NASA Agency-Wide Computer Security PlanNASA concurs with both parts of the recommendation. Regarding less dependence on human compliance, all NASA Centers have installed software and hardware tools that automatically scan for hostile code, system vulnerabilities, and hostile intrusions. These tools are not perfect; they require human oversight. However, they do reduce the amount of manual labor and the amount of human discretion involved in finding and dealing with attacks. NASA is exploring with vendors the possibility of applying artificial intelligence techniques to identify patterns in intrusion detection data that may not be obvious. This field has not yet matured to the point that products or services are available, but we are hopeful that, in a year or two, prototype products may be available for evaluation. These products would reduce the amount of manual analysis required to identify attacks, and they would make it easier to correlate data from different Centers. We also use audits and metric reports to verify that human compliance has been adequate. For example, this year we will engage a third party to perform a technical audit of IT security provisions at three NASA Centers. Metric reports on security plans, training, and system vulnerabilities help us to track performance, thereby reducing discretion in compliance with NASA policy. However, IT security evolves rapidly. New threats must be countered manually until they are well enough understood for defense to be automated. Thus, we expect to rely on human intellect and energy to identify and deal with novel developments. Regarding requiring contractors to participate in its security efforts, we issued for comments, in January, a draft regulation to be included in the NASA supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulations. This regulation would require NASA contractors, who operate computers or network systems on behalf of NASA, to adhere to appropriate provisions of NASA policies and procedures for information technology security. Comments on this draft have been dispositioned, and we expect the final regulation to be issued shortly. Also we are including contractors, such as the Consolidated Space Operations Contract, the Outsourcing Desktop Initiative for NASA, and the USA vendors, in various fora that coordinate IT security across systems operated on behalf of NASA. Although this effort is recent, we are seeing good cooperation. We expect integration of contractors to help maintain a seamless NASA IT security posture."

"Further analysis of NASA's planned agency-wide computer security system is needed to understand its vulnerabilities and the programs and activities to which the system should be applicable.Conduct a thorough analysis, together with the National Security Agency, to determine the level of computer security required by the Agency, the level of security that can be expected from the system and its most serious vulnerabilities. Also require all major mission or safety critical programs to have a qualified third party conduct a computer vulnerability analysis of their designs as soon as possible.Agency-Wide Computer System VulnerabilitiesNASA concurs in principle with both parts of this recommendation. Regarding analysis with the National Security Agency (NSA), we conducted a thorough internal study in 1998 to determine the level of required computer security, and GAO audited our computer security the same year. In addition, we are using a combination of internal audits/tests and third-party audits/tests to determine our security at a technical level. Our metrics also provides ongoing information about the adequacy of our computer security. Finally, the NASA Inspector General has made computer security a high priority for audits and inspections. Thus, we are not sure that adding another layer of analysis by the NSA will add commensurate value. Every analysis or audit disturbs ongoing work, and, at some point, additional analyses can actually degrade security because they have negative marginal value. We will discuss with the NSA what services that they could provide, to establish whether contracting with them would add significant value above what is already underway. Regarding major mission systems, we believe that there is merit in the recommendation but wish to consult with owners of such systems before levying this requirement. We require that managers of all ""special management attention"" systems complete IT security plans and provide written authorization to operate those systems this fiscal year. We expect that all major mission or safety critical systems are included among the special management attention systems. Thus, these activities will provide a documented baseline for discussion regarding the value of third-party analyses."

"NASA has initiated a well-founded, broadly encompassing computer security program to ensure that its computer systems are protected from hostile attacks, but development of security plans for all systems is lagging. Also, the function of Computer Security Officer has typically been added to the responsibilities of systems administrators.16a. Complete and maintain security plans for all appropriate computer systems and ensure that the computer security program is sustaining. 16b. Ensure that computer systems administrators are properly trained in computer security.Delays in Drafting and Implementing Computer System Security Plans and Training Especially for System Administrators16a. Code AO - Concur: We concur with the ASAP recommendation. Progress since the ASAP review consistent with the recommendation is shown below: Current Status of Computer Security Plans and Sustainability of Computer Security Program Status of Computer Security Plans: As of the second quarter of FY 2001, computer security plans for 100 percent of SMA (Special Management Attention) Systems have been completed, including authorization to operate; 97 percent of SMA Systems have all protective measures completed as stipulated in their plans; three systems have completed interim measures that give adequate security. SMA Systems are NASA's most critical systems. Sustainability of Computer Security Program: In FY 1999, NASA spent $28 million on IT security programs and measures. That amount has more than tripled in FY 2000 as NASA introduced an aggressive, Agency-wide program that stressed closer monitoring, improved reporting, expanded training, and better technology. The FY 2000 budget of $91 million targeted the Space Flight and Earth Science Enterprises for particular emphasis, with those two business units receiving 80 percent of the ITS budget. Future Computer Security Plans for Computer Systems and Plans for Ensuring Sustainability of the Computer Security Program Future Computer Security Plans for Special Management Attention (SMA) Systems: SMA Systems: By September 30, 2001 - remaining 2.4 percent of systems have completed protective measures stipulated in their plans; Mission (MSN) & Business & Restricted Technology (BRT) Systems: By June 1, 2001 - 100 percent have IT security responsibility assigned; By October 1, 2001 - 100 percent have signed IT Security Plans authorizing processing. Sustainability of the Computer Security Program: The Agency will increase the ITS budget by over ten percent in FY 2001 to $101 million, primarily to improve monitoring, protect data, and enhance technology at all Centers. 16b. Code AO - Concur: We concur with the recommendation. Status of system administrator training is shown: Current Status of Computer Security Training for Systems Administrators As of the first quarter of FY 2001, 35.6% of system administrators have received basic awareness training and IT security training for UNIX or NT systems. This is below the target of 50%. Future Computer Security Training Plans for Systems Administrators System Administrators By October 1, 2001- 90 percent of all system administrators completed during FY 2001 either the FY 2000 or the FY 2001 ""ITS Overview"" training on SOLAR or equivalent training. By October 1, 2001- 80 percent of administrators of UNIX systems completed ""UNIX Security for System Administrators"" training on SOLAR or equivalent training.* By October 1, 2001 - 80 percent of administrators of NT systems completed ""NT Security for System Administrators"" on SOLAR or equivalent training. We believe that the ITS program has made significant progress in the past two fiscal years as indicated in our response."

 Title: ,Information Technology (IT) Security Requirements Levied On Federal Agencies Do Not Align With Systems  Engineering and Integration (SE&I) Requirements Management Processes

"Federally mandated IT security requirements when implemented through the Constellation Program requirements process failed to capture scope and intent of higher level requirements.Placing a subset of NIST 800-53 controls into the SE&I requirements management process created the appearance that the NIST 800-53 controls not referenced were not applicable to system designers. The current SE&I requirements management structure is not structured to accommodate the requirement of system designers to address NIST 800-53 controls.Program specific requirements relating to IT security should be limited to the definition of interfaces between systems. Decisions regarding applicability and implementation of specific NIST 800-53 controls should be made at the lowest level possible so the intent of controls are met in the most cost efficient manner.The Constellation Program identified the need to tailor security controls for implementation in Orion/Ares flight communication systems. The resulting requirements, based on NIST 800-53 controls, were inserted in Program level requirements document and levied on system designers through the Constellation Architecture Requirements Document. This resulted in designers addressing only the allocated requirements rather than assessing the applicability of the entire standard."

Since many of these systems safeguard the lives of astronauts and cosmonauts and the safety of valuable international assets, it is crucial that security vulnerabilities be fully understood and closely managed.Accelerate the schedule of penetration exercises to gain greater insights into computer security vulnerabilities; determine if further threat analysis should be conducted; review all vulnerabilities; and ensure that plans are adequately formulated to mitigate these vulnerabilities and that work is proceeding to prevent critical systems from being compromised. Accelerate the schedule for the implementation of triple Data Encryption System (DES).Terrorist attacks of 9/11 have reinforced the need to protect NASA network and communications resources from intrusion.The Agency and Center IT security program is a risk-based management and acceptance process. The program continues to evolve to incorporate and facilitate tools and metrics for greater insight into security vulnerabilities. Currently the Centers perform quarterly vulnerability scans and metrics that are reported to the Agency. The vulnerabilities found are reviewed and worked through a defined process. Mission Critical systems external interfaces such as those of the JSC Mission Control Center with the JSC Institutional Network are included in these quarterly assessments. We will continue to work to improve this process and capability as new technologies and tools become available. The change to incorporate the triple DES has been negotiated with the contractor; a probabilistic risk assessment associated with losing S-band communications is being conducted prior to Program implementation."

Significant parts of NASA's initial plan depend upon the voluntary compliance of system users including contractors.Expand the agency-wide security system development work to include less dependence on human compliance with the system. NASA should also require contractors to participate in its security efforts.Implementation of NASA Agency-Wide Computer Security PlanNASA concurs with both parts of the recommendation. Regarding less dependence on human compliance, all NASA Centers have installed software and hardware tools that automatically scan for hostile code, system vulnerabilities, and hostile intrusions. These tools are not perfect; they require human oversight. However, they do reduce the amount of manual labor and the amount of human discretion involved in finding and dealing with attacks. NASA is exploring with vendors the possibility of applying artificial intelligence techniques to identify patterns in intrusion detection data that may not be obvious. This field has not yet matured to the point that products or services are available, but we are hopeful that, in a year or two, prototype products may be available for evaluation. These products would reduce the amount of manual analysis required to identify attacks, and they would make it easier to correlate data from different Centers. We also use audits and metric reports to verify that human compliance has been adequate. For example, this year we will engage a third party to perform a technical audit of IT security provisions at three NASA Centers. Metric reports on security plans, training, and system vulnerabilities help us to track performance, thereby reducing discretion in compliance with NASA policy. However, IT security evolves rapidly. New threats must be countered manually until they are well enough understood for defense to be automated. Thus, we expect to rely on human intellect and energy to identify and deal with novel developments. Regarding requiring contractors to participate in its security efforts, we issued for comments, in January, a draft regulation to be included in the NASA supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulations. This regulation would require NASA contractors, who operate computers or network systems on behalf of NASA, to adhere to appropriate provisions of NASA policies and procedures for information technology security. Comments on this draft have been dispositioned, and we expect the final regulation to be issued shortly. Also we are including contractors, such as the Consolidated Space Operations Contract, the Outsourcing Desktop Initiative for NASA, and the USA vendors, in various fora that coordinate IT security across systems operated on behalf of NASA. Although this effort is recent, we are seeing good cooperation. We expect integration of contractors to help maintain a seamless NASA IT security posture."

The current SE&I requirements management structure is not structured to accommodate the requirement of system designers to address NIST 800-53 controls.Program specific requirements relating to IT security should be limited to the definition of interfaces between systems. Decisions regarding applicability and implementation of specific NIST 800-53 controls should be made at the lowest level possible so the intent of controls are met in the most cost efficient manner.The Constellation Program identified the need to tailor security controls for implementation in Orion/Ares flight communication systems. The resulting requirements, based on NIST 800-53 controls, were inserted in Program level requirements document and levied on system designers through the Constellation Architecture Requirements Document. This resulted in designers addressing only the allocated requirements rather than assessing the applicability of the entire standard."

cyber security measures for data and systems,cosine,msmarco-distilbert-base-v4,3,0.40737631916999817,837,False Alarm Mitigation Techniques,,Not Specified,"The reliability of a system's BIT can be determined in part by the number of false alarms it experiences. If the BIT can not accurately identify and report the occurrence of failures then the test has failed its mission. Testability must be treated with the same level of importance as other design disciplines. BIT reliability must be considered just as critical as any other performance requirement. A system cannot perform its mission if its components are constantly being removed for false maintenance.Minimize the occurrence and effect of Built In Test (BIT) false alarms by applying principles and techniques that are intended to reduce the probability of false alarms and increase the reliability of BIT in avionics and other electronic equipment.This Lesson Learned is based on Maintainability Technique number DFE-2 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4628, Recommended Techniques for Effective Maintainability. Benefit: Effectively implementing Built-in-Test (BIT) techniques automatically reduces the number of BIT false alarms. Decreasing the number of BIT false alarms increases a system's availability and decreases the maintenance man-hours required. The overall result is a reduction of the system's life cycle cost. Implementation Method: To mitigate false alarms, a system's BIT circuitry must be able to cope with a limited amount of anomalous performance. NASA Handbook 5300.4 (1E) defines a false alarm as an indicated fault where no fault exists. Based on this definition, this technique is concerned only with BIT indications of system malfunction which cause unnecessary maintenance actions. The inability of a system to detect or report the occurrence of a failure, a fails to alarm condition, is not a false alarm and is not addressed. BIT should be designed to distinguish between actual failures and anomalies which must be tolerated due to adverse operating conditions or that are normal anomalies within acceptable limits. To accomplish this, the following principles and techniques must be mandated in the system specifications, requirement documents, and design policies and implemented in the system design. Voting Scheme One technique is called the Voting Scheme. With the voting scheme, all test data are analyzed by three or more different computers. A failure is declared only when a majority of the computers detect the same failure. An example of this type of architecture is the Space Shuttle Orbiter Avionics System. The five General Purpose Computers (GPCs) are all interconnected to the same 28 serial data channels. The GPCs perform all system-level processing and require a majority agreement on all test signals. This technique requires an extensive use of resources but is extremely effective at mitigating false alarms. A less complicated version of this is the use of double or triple redundant monitors. Having two or more sensors in series increases the reliability of the test data reported while only requiring a single computer or processor. Continuous Monitoring Continuous monitoring with BIT filtering can be used in place of the voting scheme. With this technique, BIT results are based on a integration of successive measurements of a signal over a period of time instead of a single check of the signal. The monitoring of the signal does not have to be continuous but only sampled over the time period. The filtering involves comparing the current reading of a signal with past and future readings of the same signal. This filtering allows for the disregarding of sporadic out-of-limit measurements. Only when a signal is out-of-limits for a predefined time limit or a sequence of tests identify the same failure, should the BIT flag be set. To maximize the effectiveness of continuous monitoring, the BIT data must be recorded. Once recorded, the data need to be summarized and evaluated so that trends can be tracked and weaknesses identified. Controls should be implemented to help manage all of this data. The number of signals monitored and the maximum sample rate can be limited. The time span over which data are collected should be set at a reasonable period, and the type of data accumulated should be restricted. Finally, computing techniques can be used that do not require the storage of old data. Once the information is gathered, a failure log should be created. This failure log is the basis for future modifications to the system's BIT. To improve the BIT, every instant of anomalous performance not related to an identified failure mode should be analyzed and the root causes identified. Some form of corrective action must be taken to avoid recurrence. If a design change cannot be made, then the BIT must be modified to accommodate the non-failure causing anomaly. The need for modification requires BIT to be flexible. Test parameters and limits must be easily changed. The operator should be able to control or even change the test sequence. This flexibility allows the necessary changes in the BIT to be made if false alarms start occurring. For example, the Space Station's Command and Data Handling System uses programmable Deadman Timers in the multiplexer/demultiplexer (MDM's) and standard data processor (SDP's). The response intervals of the timers can be adjusted by the system controller to accommodate changes in system configuration or mode of operation. However, the BIT software must be changed without disturbing the system operation. For this to be possible, the BIT software must be independent of the operating software. Decentralized Architecture Another technique for mitigating false alarms is the use of a distributed or decentralized BIT architecture. With this approach the BIT is implemented so that a NO GO on a given test directly isolates the implied failure to a replaceable unit. Locating most of the BIT internal to a unit greatly reduces the possibility of incorrect isolation of a failure. Although the decentralized BIT concept consists primarily of unit level tests, some system level testing is still required. An excellent technology for combining unit level testing with system level testing is boundary scan. Boundary scan is the application of a partitioning scan ring at the boundary of integrated circuit (IC) designs to provide controllability and observability access via scan operations. In Figure 1, an IC is shown with an application logic section, related input and output, and a boundary scan path consisting of a series of boundary scan cells (BSC), one BSC per IC function pin. The BSCs are interconnected to form a scan path between the host IC's Test Data Input (TDI) pin and Test Data Output (TDO) pin, for serial access. [D] Figure 1. Integrated Circuit with Boundary Scan Paths During normal IC operation, input and output signals pass freely through each BSC, from the Normal Data Input (NDI) to the Normal Data Output (NDO). However, when the boundary test mode is entered, the IC's boundary is partitioned in such a way that test stimulus can be shifted in and applied from each BSC output (NDO). The test response can then be captured at each BSC input (NDI) and shifted out for inspection. Internal testing of the application logic is accomplished by applying test stimulus from the input BSCs and capturing test response at the output BSCs. External testing of wiring interconnects and neighboring ICs on a board assembly is accomplished by applying test stimulus from the output BSCs and capturing test response at the input BSCs. This application of a scan path at the boundary of IC designs provides an embedded testing capability that can overcome test access problems. The unit level tests can also be combined for a subsystem or system level verification (Figure 2). More details on applying these techniques are in IEEE Standards 1149.1 Boundary Scan and 1149.5 System and Maintenance Bus. [D] Figure 2: Typical Test Regimen for Space Systems Finally, high-reliability components should be used in the design. The reliability of the BIT hardware should at least equal or exceed that of the hardware it is testing. The BIT software also needs to be thoroughly tested and verified to ensure that it will not be a source of false alarms. Accordingly, adequate amounts of effort and resources must be allocated during the design phase. The designer should not be unduly limited by memory size, component count, or any other allocated resource. These guidelines are not all inclusive. The false alarm problem is very complex. Each system is unique and must be approached differently. The best approach is simply to eliminate each factor as it is identified.

By nature these software packages are widely available and are subject to analysis and compromise by communities dedicated to identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. Projects utilizing commercial web software should proactively monitor security bulletins, conduct penetration testing, and ensure efficient and effective team working structures and processes in order to mitigate this risk.Patch releases may not be available when exploits are identified. Teams should be prepared to handle these types of situations. Incident drills are a useful tool, but at the end of the day the most important asset is the ability of the team to respond to the issue at hand efficiently and effectively. The development and operations teams must be well-coordinated. DevOps working models are highly recommended and ensure constant collaboration and involvement between the two teams. Both teams should have a strong understanding of the roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of members of each team, and should be familiar with working together to overcome issues. Active monitoring of common security bulletin networks, and even software-specific bulletins, may not be sufficient in order to identify zero-day vulnerabilities. Additional, specific information avenues should be explored for crucial software components. Commercial intrusion detection / prevention mechanisms and web application firewalls may not monitor certain attack vectors. Each application must be analyzed based on its individual components in order to determine which aspects need additional monitoring, and these monitoring devices should be tailored to the application.Ensure all software packages are kept up-to-date with the latest official release. This will likely cause the project to incur additional operations cost (including development and regression testing) and should be included up-front in the project plan and estimate. Do not accept (or at least critically evaluate) software packages that are not well-maintained and do not have a healthy user community. Do not accept (or at least critically evaluate) software packages that do not have a security bulletin / notification process. Critically evaluate software packages that have many dependencies, as this can make it more difficult to maintain this software and upgrade on short notice, if need-be. Maintain an approved IT Security Plan that addresses software patch update processes and an Incident Response Plan. At a minimum, conduct Incident Response plan drills annually. Actively seek out security bulletins and information that may be posted on less conventional security news distribution networks. As an example, actively monitor Metasploit (and other penetration testing software) package additions. Active monitoring of CVEs is likely not sufficient, especially when dealing with zero-day exploits. Incorporate custom log-monitoring and notification solutions tailored to your system and your team’s needs. Do not rely entirely on commercial intrusion detection/prevention packages – take proactive action to protect your application with multiple security layers.In March 2017, a Chinese vulnerability assessment company posted an exploit for the popular Apache Struts2 web framework. Within hours, an addition to a common penetration testing application called Metasploit had been added that would scan for this vulnerability. This caused the attack vector of the exploit to be rapidly distributed before the software vendor could post a patch update to fix the issue. This zero-day exploit was quickly picked up by several malicious groups and used to attack websites using the Struts2 framework. Among those attacked were several public-facing NASA sites, including NASA TechPort (https://techport.nasa.gov). Up to this point, the only mention of this vulnerability by the software vendor was a post on their wiki page describing a potential vulnerability of moderate concern - no Mitre Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) had been created and no patch release had been announced. The issue was further exacerbated by the notoriously high level of effort required to update the Struts2 software package due to extensive dependencies and breaking changes between major release versions. Because the NASA TechPort Team had incorporated log-monitoring and notification mechanisms, they were notified within a matter of minutes of suspicious behavior. The TechPort Team immediately invoked their Incident Response Plan and gathered the key members of the Response Team, which included the system administrator, security lead, and technical lead. After assessing the situation and determining that no patch was available from the vendor, the TechPort Team devised a custom solution to the issue which was rapidly tested and deployed. The success of this fix was primarily due to the TechPort Team’s DevOps working model and the rapid deployment capabilities of a team-operated cloud computing environment."

A decision to forego fault protection will increase the risk of unrecoverable single point failures. Fault protection is the use of cooperative design of flight and ground elements (including hardware, software, procedures, etc.) to detect and respond to perceived spacecraft faults. Its purpose is to eliminate single point failures or their effects and to ensure spacecraft system integrity under anomalous conditions.A decision to forego fault protection will increase the risk of unrecoverable single point failures.Fault protection is the use of cooperative design of flight and ground elements (including hardware, software, procedures, etc.) to detect and respond to perceived spacecraft faults. Its purpose is to eliminate single point failures or their effects and to ensure spacecraft system integrity under anomalous conditions.This Lessons Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1243; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test. Fault protection design maximizes the probability of spacecraft mission success by avoiding possible single failure points through the use of autonomous, short-term compensation for failed hardware. Implementation Method: Except during critical event periods, the primary purpose of an autonomous fault protection system is to place the spacecraft in a safe, commandable state which can be maintained for a reasonable period (typically two weeks) following a fault. During critical periods, the primary purpose of the fault protection system is to ensure the completion of the critical event. A simplified block diagram representing the following three general types of fault protection is illustrated in Figure 1: Subsystems alone. Subsystem to system, and System to ground control. [D] Fault Protection Allocations. All on-board, post lift-off, autonomous fault protection is designated as either quotsubsystem internalquot or quotsystemquot fault protection. Fault protection engineering elements which have been allocated fault protection responsibility must provide the requirements and design for the associated detections, monitors, responses, and diagnostic data in compliance with project functional requirements. Where science instruments include fault protection in their design, designers must still ensure compliance with spacecraft project fault protection requirements if one of the following conditions apply: The fault protection internal to the instrument is dependent on non-standard services from another subsystem (or another instrument), or Internal failures have an impact external to the instrument (viz, a change in power state, momentum, support to other instruments). Spacecraft Safing. Spacecraft quotsafingquot is a general purpose safe-state response which is initiated by both system and subsystem internal fault protection. The purpose of this response is to provide the following: A safe state for the hardware An uplink, and A downlink (with some exceptions for specific failure conditions). To achieve these goals, the normal stored sequence is terminated and non-essential spacecraft loads are powered off. Undervoltage Response. Most spacecraft designs include an undervoltage response, which is designed to protect the spacecraft in the event of a short or a bus overload. The hardware senses when the power drops below an established value for a specified time. If the criteria are met, the power system sheds all non-essential loads from the bus and indicates the undervoltage condition to the Command Subsystem, which will initiate the undervoltage recovery response. Critical spacecraft memories are maintained throughout the undervoltage. Functional Implementation Requirements. Fault protection is typically allocated to the on-board elements of the system in accordance with the following principles: Spacecraft versus ground control. Autonomous fault protection is included on board the spacecraft only if a response by Mission Operations is not feasible nor practical, or if action is required within two weeks of detecting the failure. Otherwise, ground control is responsible for fault recovery. In both cases, ground control is responsible for failure diagnosis and, if necessary, the configuration of the spacecraft to nominal operations after the fault. Protection against sabotage and operator errors. To simplify the development of fault protection, autonomous fault protection is not required to protect against sabotage or operator errors, although such protection is not prohibited. There is limited spacecraft protection against these failures (viz, information system data integrity checks and some software checks). Protection against spacecraft hardware and software design errors. To simplify the development of fault protection, autonomous fault protection is usually not required to protect against spacecraft design errors, although it is not prohibited if practical. The practice of fault protection typically provides some limited spacecraft protection against design errors (e.g., thermal fault responses). The autonomous fault protection function is responsible for all on-board fault detections and corrections except those routinely required to ensure spacecraft data integrity (viz, EDAC, Reed Solomon encoder, checksums, etc.). Data error detections and corrections may be used, however, for fault protection purposes. The spacecraft information system typically has the primary responsibility for ensuring data integrity. Fault Protection Design Requirements. Management and coordination of fault detection, monitoring, and response, for both system and subsystem internal fault protection, is performed in accordance with the following general rules: Enables/disables for responses. Where applicable, fault responses should have two enable/disable mechanisms (or the functional equivalent): an enable/disable by stored sequence, and an enable/disable by ground control or by fault protection algorithms. Enables/disables for monitor activation of any response. If a response can be initiated by more than one monitor, those monitors should include an enable/disable mechanism or the functional equivalent. Enable/disable state specification. Each enable/disable is specified by a single parameter unique to each fault protection algorithm. Enable/disable strategy - general. As a goal, fault protection monitors and responses should be designed to be enabled for the entire mission. This reduces the risk of incorrect fault protection states. Enable/disable strategy - critical events. For critical events, enable/disable strategies may be used to minimize or prevent the effects of an erroneous fault indication. Response initiation. Fault responses are initiated if and only if spacecraft performance is unacceptable, or there is a significant risk to the mission or to subsystem safety. Parameter modifications. All fault protection parameters which may reasonably be expected to change as a function of mission mode, type of activity, fault history, or operational experience should be alterable by ground control without requiring flight software modification. Software modifications. To the extent possible, monitor and response algorithms should be stored in programmable RAM. Configuration compatibility. On-board fault protection should be designed to respond to a fault while in any possible spacecraft configuration (e.g., fault protection should be able to accommodate all possible combinations). Independence from instruments. Engineering fault protection should not depend on science instruments or their data. Multiple faults. At a minimum, fault protection should be designed with the assumption that only one fault occurs at a time, and that a subsequent fault will occur no earlier than the response completion time for the first fault. As a goal, fault protection should be capable of recovering from multiple successive or coincident faults provided that the faults and associated fault algorithms are independent. Propagation of failures. Autonomous fault protection assumes that spacecraft hardware design ensures that a single failure in a subsystem (including instruments) cannot propagate to its redundant unit or to another subsystem, or prevent switching to its redundant unit. This can be verified by performing a failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) or fault tree analysis (FTA). Typical Fault Detection Design Requirements. Hardware and software detection sources have two criteria: Direct detection. Detection mechanisms should be as direct as possible (i.e., a direct measurement is preferred over a calculated or derived measurement). Detection coverage. Detection mechanisms should only be required to detect a failure to the level at which that failure can be isolated or corrected. Design Requirements for Fault Monitors. Software monitors used by system and subsystem internal fault protection have the following features: Monitor thresholds. Where possible, thresholds should use reasonableness checks, detection filtering (to exclude certain faults from a previously established fault database), or redundant detections. Threshold modifications. Monitor threshold values should be alterable by ground or sequence command, or by fault protection responses as appropriate. As a goal, monitors are best designed to detect and disregard failed sensors. Redundant detection. For detections where an inadvertent trip would result in a severe response (viz, downlink loss, irreversible hardware swaps, large use of expendables, critical sequence cancellation), and where a sensor anomaly could cause an inadvertent trip, independent physically or functionally redundant detections are employed such that simultaneous detections are necessary for response initiation. Fault response tolerance. Monitors are designed to be tolerant of off-nominal conditions following a reconfiguration resulting from a fault protection response (e.g., thresholds might be relaxed as part of a response). Design Requirements for Fault Responses. System and subsystem internal fault response concerns include: Fault response primary responsibility. Following an anomaly, fault responses should ensure spacecraft commandability and the maintenance of a safe state for at least two weeks. This requirement is superseded only by a requirement to complete a critical event. Fault protection priorities. Fault responses are designed with the following priorities: Protect critical spacecraft functionality, Protect spacecraft performance and consumables, Minimize disruptions to normal sequence operations, and Simplify ground recovery response, including providing for downlink telemetry. Multiple levels of response. Where possible, response design includes multiple levels of response, with the response actions executed in order of increasing severity. Real-time ground responses. Autonomous fault protection is designed so as to not require real-time ground responses for recovery from known faults. False alarm tolerance. Unintended entry into a fault protection response in the absence of a fault must not present a hazard to the spacecraft or mission. For critical event periods, however, this requirement is relaxed and is considered a goal. Use of redundant (and spare) units. Redundant or spare units may be used by autonomous fault protection responses if a satisfactory alternative design is not available. Unpowered redundant units. The transition of a unit from quotoffquot to quotprimequot must not require ground commands in order to support spacecraft fault protection and mission critical functions. Component warm-up times. Fault responses should take into account component warm-up times and similar delay requirements. Data Handling Requirements. The following data handling tasks are performed: Recording engineering data. The combination of sequences and fault responses should ensure the recording of engineering data prior to, during, and after the execution of any fault response. Some exceptions are made for recorder and command subsystems failures. Storage and preservation of diagnostic data. Fault protection is designed to include the storage of diagnostic data (see Telemetry and Diagnostic Data on page 7), and ensure that data are not overwritten as the result of a response action. This requirement only applies if the writing of diagnostic data is not affected by the original fault. Protection of critical science and engineering data. Fault responses must not destroy quotcritical dataquot stored on-board the spacecraft. quotCritical science and engineering dataquot must be defined by project policy. Requirements Interactions with Stored Sequences. The following interactions with on-board sequences may be necessary: Response design for critical events. Fault response is designed to ensure the completion of the critical event as and when required, with spacecraft safety having lower priority, until the critical events are completed. Orbit insertion is an example of a critical event. Response design for non-critical events. Unless required to execute a critical event, fault responses should stop any on-board sequence(s) only if the sequence(s) compromises the integrity of the fault response, or if the fault response compromises the integrity of the sequence. Reactivation of stored sequences. After completion of a response which terminates a non-critical stored sequence, fault responses should not autonomously resume the terminated sequence. Safing Requirements. quotSafingquot is defined as a general purpose fault response which results in the cancellation of non-critical sequences, the possible suspension of critical sequences, and a general reconfiguration of spacecraft components. Safing responses typically include the following general features: Uplink communications. The safing response provides for a spacecraft state and attitude that ensures uplink commandability in the long term. Downlink communications. The safing response provides for a spacecraft state and attitude that ensures continuous engineering telemetry with positive link margin. Environmental constraints. The safing response meets boresight and radiator environmental constraints. Safing priorities. When uplink, downlink, and hardware safing requirements are in conflict, the following priorities apply: Provide a safe state for the hardware, Provide an uplink, and Provide a downlink. Ultimately, uplink must be provided for in the long term. Benign spacecraft configuration. As a goal, safing responses should place the spacecraft in an operationally benign state. This includes but is not limited to the following: (1) powering off of all non-essential equipment including instruments, and (2) stopping of all non-essential spacecraft processes. Telemetry and Diagnostic Data Requirements. The spacecraft design should ensure that following an anomaly, spacecraft telemetry will be sufficient to perform the preliminary failure identification and analysis required for ground control to perform near-term corrective actions. At a minimum, the real-time telemetry stream includes the following: Measurements to unambiguously identify the current engineering subsystem configuration and operating status, Enable/disable states of fault protection software, and enable/disable states of fault protection dedicated hardware, Active/inactive states for fault protection software responses, Identification that a fault response has been activated, Monitor detection logic output (regardless of whether the monitor is enabled or disabled), and As appropriate, cumulative counters of faults detected. Telemetry design should ensure reasonable and timely sampling frequencies for these items. As a goal, the real-time telemetry stream should include monitor high water marks. A quothigh water markquot is defined as a measurement which identifies how close a monitor is to indicating a failure. Following an anomaly involving a fault protection activity, the spacecraft design should ensure that sufficient information is available to reconstruct the audit trail-- the sequence of fault protection events following the anomaly. Diagnostic data is also needed to analyze the anomaly and to identify the sequential effects of the anomaly on spacecraft performance. The data should be available in non-volatile telemetry or stored on-board for later retrieval by the ground system. At a minimum, diagnostic data should include unique identification and time-tagging of monitors and responses which have been active. It is also desirable that diagnostic data include the value of the measurement which initiated a response. Technical Rationale: JPL has incurred numerous instances of presumably redundant systems which failed to successfully transfer to the back-up path when the primary path did not function. A rigorous, systematic search, crosstrap FMECA, or sneak paths analysis could have foretold the failure, and redesign could have averted the problem. Prevention of propagating failures has its greatest value when supplemented by an on-board fault protection system. The practice of failure propagation prevention is of most value in a repairable system. Non-propagation minimizes the number of units requiring repair. In a non-fault protected spacecraft, this capability is limited to the preflight phases of either subsystem or system testing. In a fault protected spacecraft, it can be extended to the flight phase as well. The key to this investigation is a complete diagram of the involved interface circuits which penetrates each unit to a circuit depth sufficient to prove that no possible failures in one unit can propagate to become irreversible hardware failures in a second unit. Another input is a complete list of part or assembly failure modes for hypothesis. Successful transfer (or equivalently independence of the primary and back-up functions) is a necessity for either repairable or non-repairable systems and requires the same complete interface diagram and complete list of failure modes. Such a list must include items such as: Part failure modes (opens, shorts, stiction, etc.), Single event effects (latch-up, transfer, etc.), and EMI (latch-up, transfer, overvoltage). These last two items are critical since they can affect both sides of a redundant pair.

Based on these brief documents, the project team can collectively determine how the members can most efficiently generate all of the requisite simulated datasets.A Science Data Processing System (SDPS) is typically developed for a NASA project to accommodate the huge quantities of raw science data downlinked from instruments or experiments over the course of a mission. Sometimes referred to as a Science Data System (SDS), the SDPS converts telemetry into higher level science data products provided to the science community for research and applications. The SDPS is centered at the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on JPL-managed missions, where JPL is responsible for processing and distributing data products in a timely manner as required to meet mission objectives. Figure 1 depicts the science data flow to and from the science data processing function. One critical task in SDPS development is data simulation, a technique that provides visualizations of the extremely large and complicated science datasets and permits verification of the system. Figure 1. The science data processing function is depicted within the context of the entire Mission Operations System (MOS) for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory mission Legend: OSC– Orbital Sciences Corp; GSFC– NASA Goddard Space Flight Center The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO), an Earth orbiting satellite mission managed by JPL, was designed to make precise, time-dependent, global measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). In developing the SDPS for OCO, The Ground Data System (GDS) Team (which is responsible for spacecraft and instrument monitoring and operations) did a good job of leveraging the Instrument and Observatory thermal-vacuum test output to generate datasets for system testing (Reference (1)). The team generated multiple sets of data that represented varying conditions. These data provided a good basis for OCO system testing. Unfortunately, the GDS Team was unable to generate simulated data that covered all critical operational modes. The team only generated Attitude Control System (ACS) data for the Nadir mode, and was unable to generate ACS data in the Glint or Target modes. Further, the team was not able to generate data that could run through Level 2. The Instrument thermal-vacuum tests recorded only direct solar observations, rather than solar light reflected off the surface of the Earth. The science retrieval algorithms could not work with direct solar observations. It should be noted that, despite the best efforts of the team that plans and performs an SDPS test, it is not uncommon for the SDPS test configuration and environment to be unable to generate certain characters of test data. In such cases, certain simulated data sets are generated by the science instrument during system-level testing (e.g., thermal-vacuum test), while other types of simulated data are generated by an algorithm scientist and inserted into the processing chain to exercise and validate certain science data product software executables. The Algorithm Team generated a partial orbit of spectra that simulated the spectra that they expected to see in flight. The GDS obtained that dataset, manipulated it into an OCO L1B (registered radiance at the sensor product dataset) file, and gathered the ancillary data needed to run the dataset through the Level 2 AOPD (Agent-Oriented Program & Design algorithm) PGE (Product Generation Executive). Even at launch, however, that dataset had not yet been diffused into the system testing process. For OCO, the full set of required test cases was not identified soon enough to conduct the additional planning needed for their generation. For the OCO-2 follow-on project, the full set of simulated test cases was known, and the GDS Team began early to determine which sets should be implemented and which sets the project could omit as an acceptable risk.

Also require all major mission or safety critical programs to have a qualified third party conduct a computer vulnerability analysis of their designs as soon as possible.Agency-Wide Computer System VulnerabilitiesNASA concurs in principle with both parts of this recommendation. Regarding analysis with the National Security Agency (NSA), we conducted a thorough internal study in 1998 to determine the level of required computer security, and GAO audited our computer security the same year. In addition, we are using a combination of internal audits/tests and third-party audits/tests to determine our security at a technical level. Our metrics also provides ongoing information about the adequacy of our computer security. Finally, the NASA Inspector General has made computer security a high priority for audits and inspections. Thus, we are not sure that adding another layer of analysis by the NSA will add commensurate value. Every analysis or audit disturbs ongoing work, and, at some point, additional analyses can actually degrade security because they have negative marginal value. We will discuss with the NSA what services that they could provide, to establish whether contracting with them would add significant value above what is already underway. Regarding major mission systems, we believe that there is merit in the recommendation but wish to consult with owners of such systems before levying this requirement. We require that managers of all ""special management attention"" systems complete IT security plans and provide written authorization to operate those systems this fiscal year. We expect that all major mission or safety critical systems are included among the special management attention systems. Thus, these activities will provide a documented baseline for discussion regarding the value of third-party analyses."

It does not, however, require projects to obtain center Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) approval of the tailored software safety plans nor does it require Verification and Validation (V&V) per se. While the software assurance standard does mention V&V, it does not require any independence of V&V for safety-critical software.27a. NASA should require approval of a project's tailored software safety plan by both the center S&MA organization and by one administrative level higher than that making the request. 27b. NASA's software safety plan should require formal V&V of safety-critical software. Testing alone does not suffice. 27c. NASA should develop an explicit policy that requires independent V&V for safety-critical software.Potential Inadequacy of NASA Agencywide Software Safety Policy Requirements27a. NASA agrees with the intent of this recommendation but believes the requirements for formal system safety program plans and software management plans exist and, with proper and firm enforcement, fulfill the objective of this recommendation. To be sure that these requirements are perfectly understood, the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) will update NSS 1740.13, ""NASA Software Safety Standard,"" to explicitly state that the program/project manager for programs/projects perform an assessment to determine, based on the level of criticality and risk, the scope and level of Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) to be planned. The results of the assessment will be formally reviewed by Center Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA). The program/project manager, in consultation with SMA, will tailor an approach to ensure that the appropriate V&V requirements are established and implemented. The OSMA will place more emphasis on the implementation and enforcement of these existing requirements. Process verification, recently established in the OSMA, will be used to evaluate and enforce these existing policy and requirements more aggressively. NASA is committed to assuring that required program management plans and any subordinate plans such as software or safety management plans cover the essential requirements for programs where warranted by cost, size, complexity, lifespan, risk, and consequence of failure. Additional changes are being incorporated into NPG 7120.5, ""NASA Program/Project Management Guide"" (currently under development), to ensure that necessary and sufficient requirements will be fulfilled for programs having software vulnerabilities. SMA organizations at each level are to be a party to these decisions and are to intervene where necessary to assure that proper and clearly documented decisions are made by the appropriate level of management. The Program Management Councils could play a role in adjudicating any issues with the content of program management plans. 27b. NASA agrees with the intent of this recommendation and is confident that NPD 2820, ""NASA Software Policies"" (currently under development), will ensure that software management and/or safety plans developed for any NASA program/project will specify the level of V&V and types of testing that should be implemented. NPD 2820 policy relating to software V&V states that NASA will create and/or acquire and maintain software through risk-based management. Risk management products shall be documented or referenced in a management plan. NASA will employ V&V, IV&V, and other trusted verification techniques for appropriate risk mitigation based on the cost, size, complexity, lifespan, risk, and consequence of failure. NSS 1740.13 is not a NASA Software Safety Plan. The level of detailed requirements that the ASAP is recommending be in NSS 1740.13 more appropriately belongs in the documents that the programs and projects will prepare in response to NSS 1740.13. These details need to be documented in the Software Management Plan (SMP), the System Safety Program Plan (SSPP), or the Program Management Plan (PMP). NASA maintains that the requirement stated in NASA-STD-2100-91, ""Software Documentation Standard,"" suffices as a requirement for addressing the issue of V&V for programs. NHB 1700.1, ""NASA Safety Policy and Requirements Document,"" requires NASA program managers to publish and maintain an approved NASA Safety Management Plan (SMP). The program manager is responsible for approval of the NASA SMP and contractor Safety Program Plan (SPP). The system safety manager (SSM), assigned by the program manager (PM) from the Center Safety and Mission Assurance organization, prepares the SMP. The SSM, reviews the contractor's SPP and provides recommendations to the PM. The SSM, upon review of the contractor's SPP, will have the required insight into the approach for software V&V to ensure that a proper balance of analyses, inspections, and testing is planned for the entire life cycle of the program. NASA's SMA organizations at the NASA Centers are currently involved in the review of V&V plans for software and do make recommendations to the PM. 27c. NASA agrees with the premise that safety-critical software is a prime candidate for IV&V; however, it is NASA's position that all software determined to be safety-critical by engineering or safety analyses need not be subjected to IV&V. To be sure that program/project managers plan for the proper level of both V&V and IV&V from the outset, the OSMA will update NSS 1740.13, ""NASA Software Safety Standard,"" to explicitly state that program/project managers perform an assessment to determine the scope and level of IV&V based on the level of criticality and risk. The results of the assessment will be formally reviewed by SMA. This way, the program/project manager, in consultation with SMA, will tailor an approach to ensure that the appropriate V&V requirements are established and implemented. NPD 2820 has incorporated the proper approach for software on NASA programs/projects; the directive requires program managers to employ IV&V, V&V, and other proven verification techniques for risk mitigation, based on cost, complexity, risk, and consequence of failure. NPG 7120.5, ""NASA Program/Project Management Guide"" (currently under development), will reflect some of the requirements now found in documents that program managers may not normally review for compliance."

Significant parts of NASA's initial plan depend upon the voluntary compliance of system users including contractors.Expand the agency-wide security system development work to include less dependence on human compliance with the system. NASA should also require contractors to participate in its security efforts.Implementation of NASA Agency-Wide Computer Security PlanNASA concurs with both parts of the recommendation. Regarding less dependence on human compliance, all NASA Centers have installed software and hardware tools that automatically scan for hostile code, system vulnerabilities, and hostile intrusions. These tools are not perfect; they require human oversight. However, they do reduce the amount of manual labor and the amount of human discretion involved in finding and dealing with attacks. NASA is exploring with vendors the possibility of applying artificial intelligence techniques to identify patterns in intrusion detection data that may not be obvious. This field has not yet matured to the point that products or services are available, but we are hopeful that, in a year or two, prototype products may be available for evaluation. These products would reduce the amount of manual analysis required to identify attacks, and they would make it easier to correlate data from different Centers. We also use audits and metric reports to verify that human compliance has been adequate. For example, this year we will engage a third party to perform a technical audit of IT security provisions at three NASA Centers. Metric reports on security plans, training, and system vulnerabilities help us to track performance, thereby reducing discretion in compliance with NASA policy. However, IT security evolves rapidly. New threats must be countered manually until they are well enough understood for defense to be automated. Thus, we expect to rely on human intellect and energy to identify and deal with novel developments. Regarding requiring contractors to participate in its security efforts, we issued for comments, in January, a draft regulation to be included in the NASA supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulations. This regulation would require NASA contractors, who operate computers or network systems on behalf of NASA, to adhere to appropriate provisions of NASA policies and procedures for information technology security. Comments on this draft have been dispositioned, and we expect the final regulation to be issued shortly. Also we are including contractors, such as the Consolidated Space Operations Contract, the Outsourcing Desktop Initiative for NASA, and the USA vendors, in various fora that coordinate IT security across systems operated on behalf of NASA. Although this effort is recent, we are seeing good cooperation. We expect integration of contractors to help maintain a seamless NASA IT security posture."

Ensure that computer systems administrators are properly trained in computer security.Delays in Drafting and Implementing Computer System Security Plans and Training Especially for System Administrators16a. Code AO - Concur: We concur with the ASAP recommendation. Progress since the ASAP review consistent with the recommendation is shown below: Current Status of Computer Security Plans and Sustainability of Computer Security Program Status of Computer Security Plans: As of the second quarter of FY 2001, computer security plans for 100 percent of SMA (Special Management Attention) Systems have been completed, including authorization to operate; 97 percent of SMA Systems have all protective measures completed as stipulated in their plans; three systems have completed interim measures that give adequate security. SMA Systems are NASA's most critical systems. Sustainability of Computer Security Program: In FY 1999, NASA spent $28 million on IT security programs and measures. That amount has more than tripled in FY 2000 as NASA introduced an aggressive, Agency-wide program that stressed closer monitoring, improved reporting, expanded training, and better technology. The FY 2000 budget of $91 million targeted the Space Flight and Earth Science Enterprises for particular emphasis, with those two business units receiving 80 percent of the ITS budget. Future Computer Security Plans for Computer Systems and Plans for Ensuring Sustainability of the Computer Security Program Future Computer Security Plans for Special Management Attention (SMA) Systems: SMA Systems: By September 30, 2001 - remaining 2.4 percent of systems have completed protective measures stipulated in their plans; Mission (MSN) & Business & Restricted Technology (BRT) Systems: By June 1, 2001 - 100 percent have IT security responsibility assigned; By October 1, 2001 - 100 percent have signed IT Security Plans authorizing processing. Sustainability of the Computer Security Program: The Agency will increase the ITS budget by over ten percent in FY 2001 to $101 million, primarily to improve monitoring, protect data, and enhance technology at all Centers. 16b. Code AO - Concur: We concur with the recommendation. Status of system administrator training is shown: Current Status of Computer Security Training for Systems Administrators As of the first quarter of FY 2001, 35.6% of system administrators have received basic awareness training and IT security training for UNIX or NT systems.

By nature these software packages are widely available and are subject to analysis and compromise by communities dedicated to identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. Projects utilizing commercial web software should proactively monitor security bulletins, conduct penetration testing, and ensure efficient and effective team working structures and processes in order to mitigate this risk.Patch releases may not be available when exploits are identified. Teams should be prepared to handle these types of situations. Incident drills are a useful tool, but at the end of the day the most important asset is the ability of the team to respond to the issue at hand efficiently and effectively. The development and operations teams must be well-coordinated. DevOps working models are highly recommended and ensure constant collaboration and involvement between the two teams. Both teams should have a strong understanding of the roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of members of each team, and should be familiar with working together to overcome issues. Active monitoring of common security bulletin networks, and even software-specific bulletins, may not be sufficient in order to identify zero-day vulnerabilities. Additional, specific information avenues should be explored for crucial software components. Commercial intrusion detection / prevention mechanisms and web application firewalls may not monitor certain attack vectors. Each application must be analyzed based on its individual components in order to determine which aspects need additional monitoring, and these monitoring devices should be tailored to the application.Ensure all software packages are kept up-to-date with the latest official release. This will likely cause the project to incur additional operations cost (including development and regression testing) and should be included up-front in the project plan and estimate. Do not accept (or at least critically evaluate) software packages that are not well-maintained and do not have a healthy user community. Do not accept (or at least critically evaluate) software packages that do not have a security bulletin / notification process. Critically evaluate software packages that have many dependencies, as this can make it more difficult to maintain this software and upgrade on short notice, if need-be. Maintain an approved IT Security Plan that addresses software patch update processes and an Incident Response Plan. At a minimum, conduct Incident Response plan drills annually. Actively seek out security bulletins and information that may be posted on less conventional security news distribution networks. As an example, actively monitor Metasploit (and other penetration testing software) package additions. Active monitoring of CVEs is likely not sufficient, especially when dealing with zero-day exploits. Incorporate custom log-monitoring and notification solutions tailored to your system and your team’s needs. Do not rely entirely on commercial intrusion detection/prevention packages – take proactive action to protect your application with multiple security layers.In March 2017, a Chinese vulnerability assessment company posted an exploit for the popular Apache Struts2 web framework. Within hours, an addition to a common penetration testing application called Metasploit had been added that would scan for this vulnerability. This caused the attack vector of the exploit to be rapidly distributed before the software vendor could post a patch update to fix the issue. This zero-day exploit was quickly picked up by several malicious groups and used to attack websites using the Struts2 framework. Among those attacked were several public-facing NASA sites, including NASA TechPort (https://techport.nasa.gov). Up to this point, the only mention of this vulnerability by the software vendor was a post on their wiki page describing a potential vulnerability of moderate concern - no Mitre Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) had been created and no patch release had been announced. The issue was further exacerbated by the notoriously high level of effort required to update the Struts2 software package due to extensive dependencies and breaking changes between major release versions. Because the NASA TechPort Team had incorporated log-monitoring and notification mechanisms, they were notified within a matter of minutes of suspicious behavior. The TechPort Team immediately invoked their Incident Response Plan and gathered the key members of the Response Team, which included the system administrator, security lead, and technical lead. After assessing the situation and determining that no patch was available from the vendor, the TechPort Team devised a custom solution to the issue which was rapidly tested and deployed. The success of this fix was primarily due to the TechPort Team’s DevOps working model and the rapid deployment capabilities of a team-operated cloud computing environment."

The program continues to evolve to incorporate and facilitate tools and metrics for greater insight into security vulnerabilities. Currently the Centers perform quarterly vulnerability scans and metrics that are reported to the Agency. The vulnerabilities found are reviewed and worked through a defined process. Mission Critical systems external interfaces such as those of the JSC Mission Control Center with the JSC Institutional Network are included in these quarterly assessments. We will continue to work to improve this process and capability as new technologies and tools become available. The change to incorporate the triple DES has been negotiated with the contractor; a probabilistic risk assessment associated with losing S-band communications is being conducted prior to Program implementation."
